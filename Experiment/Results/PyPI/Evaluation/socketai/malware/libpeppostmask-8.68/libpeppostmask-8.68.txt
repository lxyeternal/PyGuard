      "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package installation, triggered conditionally, with high obfuscation and stealth tactics. The embedded URL and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered malicious until further analysis of the payload is performed."
