  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of malicious behavior, the correctness of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements an HTTP request manager with proxy support, rate limiting, and proxy rotation.\n- Proxies are supplied externally, with embedded credentials.\n- Requests are made via standard `requests` methods.\n- Response handling includes detecting \"blocked\" messages and adjusting proxies.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- Functionality aligns with legitimate use cases like web scraping or API interaction.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate proxy manager with rate limiting, proxy switching.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; proxy switching based on block messages can be exploited for evasion but is a common technique.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, considering proxy switching could be misused).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above; manages HTTP requests with proxy rotation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Proxy request management with rate limiting.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; proxy credential embedding is standard, assuming supplied externally.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Proxy management, rate limiting, request execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious actions; standard request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or backdoors.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** HTTP request handler with proxy and rate limiting.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; handling of proxies with embedded credentials is standard, assuming supplied by user.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or harmful behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2–0.3), reflecting the potential misuse of proxy switching or credential handling, but not indicating a direct threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, considering potential misuse but no inherent maliciousness)\n\n---\n\n### **Final comments:**\n\n- The code is a standard HTTP request utility with proxy support, rate limiting, and proxy rotation.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The potential for misuse exists (proxy switching, credential handling), but this is typical in legitimate proxy management tools.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
