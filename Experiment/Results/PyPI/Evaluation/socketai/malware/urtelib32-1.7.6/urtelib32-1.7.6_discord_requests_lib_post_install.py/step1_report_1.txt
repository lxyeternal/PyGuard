  "purpose": "The code fetches a piece of code from a remote server and executes it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL request to 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/' and the 'response.json().get('code')' retrieval.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec(code)' call, which executes arbitrary code obtained from an external source.",
  "flows": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server, retrieves JSON data, extracts the 'code' field, and executes it directly.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic execution of code fetched over the network; the URL and headers may be suspicious. The 'auth' header value looks unusual, potentially obfuscated or custom. No validation or sanitization of retrieved code is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'requests' for HTTP operations, then defines a main() function that sends a GET request to a specific URL with a custom 'auth' header. It extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response. If 'code' exists, it executes this code directly using 'exec'. This pattern is highly risky as it runs arbitrary remote code without verification. The URL domain appears unusual, and the header 'auth' value is non-standard, suggesting potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's primary function is to execute remotely fetched code, which can be malicious, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing unwanted commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically executes code retrieved from a remote server without any validation, posing a high security risk. It is likely malicious or at best extremely unsafe, as it can run arbitrary and potentially harmful code on the host system.",
