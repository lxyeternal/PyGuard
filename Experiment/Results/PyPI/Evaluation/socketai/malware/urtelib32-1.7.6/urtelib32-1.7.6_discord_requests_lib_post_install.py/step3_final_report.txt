  "purpose": "The code fetches remote code from a suspicious URL and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent and potential for system compromise.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/' with headers {'auth': '&&CD&&ON'}; response.json().get('code')",
  "sinks": "exec(code) - executing fetched code directly; potential for remote code execution, data theft, backdoors",
  "flows": "HTTP request -> response JSON extraction -> 'code' field -> exec() execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious URL path '/api/steal/', unusual header '&&CD&&ON', direct execution of remote code without validation",
  "analysis": "The code performs an HTTP GET to a suspicious URL, retrieves a JSON response, extracts the 'code' field, and executes it via exec() without any validation or sanitization. The URL pattern and header suggest malicious intent. The pattern is typical of malware or backdoor mechanisms, enabling remote control or data theft. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but dangerous due to remote code execution. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by the potential for system compromise. The pattern aligns with malicious activity, and the lack of validation makes it extremely unsafe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, executing remote code without validation, posing a severe security threat. The scores of malware=1, risk=0.95, obfuscated=0.2 are justified; system should treat this as a critical security issue.",
