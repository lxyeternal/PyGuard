  "purpose": "Fetches code from a remote server and executes it locally",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch data from a remote URL",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code retrieved from the network",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> response.json().get('code') -> exec(code)",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() on code obtained from an external source; the URL and header contain suspicious parameters; no validation or sanitization of fetched code",
  "analysis": "The script makes an HTTP GET request to a specific URL, passing a custom header. It retrieves a JSON response and extracts a 'code' field. The code then executes this retrieved code using exec(), which is highly risky as it can run arbitrary and potentially malicious code. The use of a hardcoded URL with suspicious parameters and the direct execution of remote code indicates malicious intent or, at minimum, extremely unsafe behavior. The code lacks any validation, authentication, or sandboxing, increasing security risk. The pattern suggests a possible backdoor or command-and-control mechanism, enabling remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by dynamically fetching and executing remote code without validation, posing a high security risk. It is likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote control or data theft.",
