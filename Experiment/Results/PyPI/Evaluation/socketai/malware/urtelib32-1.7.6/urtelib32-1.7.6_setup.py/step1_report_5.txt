  "purpose": "Customize installation process to potentially execute remote code if run with admin privileges.",
  "sources": "Reading the script itself; requesting a remote image from a URL; reading the local 'image.png' file.",
  "sinks": "Executing code decoded from 'image.png' with exec(); writing remote data to local file.",
  "flows": "Code downloads image.png from remote URL, saves it locally, then reads and executes its contents as code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated behavior: saving a remote fetched image and executing it as code; usage of try-except without handling errors; attempts to elevate privileges unconditionally.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process by defining a custom install class. It checks for administrator privileges and attempts to elevate if not. Then, it fetches a remote file 'image.png' over HTTP, writes it locally, and executes its content as code after decoding from base64. The remote URL and execution of fetched code pose significant security concerns. The code includes no validation of remote content, no integrity checks, and dynamically executes external data, indicating malicious intent or at least dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes remote code without validation, likely malicious. It seeks admin privileges and runs potentially harmful code embedded in a fetched image file. Overall, it exhibits high malicious behavior risk.",
