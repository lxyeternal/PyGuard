{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to elevate privileges, download a file, and execute its contents.",
  "sources": "Reading from open('image.png', 'wb')', requests.get() for remote content, open('image.png', 'rb') for reading the downloaded file, and sys.argv for command execution.",
  "sinks": "exec() on the decoded content of 'image.png', which executes arbitrary code potentially from external source.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote data and writes to 'image.png' -> file read via open('image.png', 'rb') -> decoded and executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Code attempts to run with administrator privileges without explicit user consent; downloads and executes remote content; uses try-except blocks with broad exception handling; suspicious URL and headers; executes arbitrary code from remote source.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process to request admin rights if not already elevated. It downloads a file from an external URL and writes it as 'image.png'. The code then reads this file, decodes it from base64, and executes its content. This pattern indicates potential malicious behavior such as remote code execution, backdoor installation, or payload delivery. The URL and headers are suspicious, and executing remote content without validation is highly risky. The code's purpose appears to be clandestine, leveraging privilege escalation and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, including remote code execution and privilege escalation, with suspicious external communication. It is strongly indicative of malicious behavior, likely designed as a backdoor or remote payload loader.",
