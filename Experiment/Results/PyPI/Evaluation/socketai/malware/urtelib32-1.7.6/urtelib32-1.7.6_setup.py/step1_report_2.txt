{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to elevate privileges, download a file from a remote server, and execute its decoded contents.",
  "sources": "Reading package setup parameters; executing the custom run method during installation; opening and reading 'image.png'; fetching remote content via requests.",
  "sinks": "Executing decoded content with exec(); writing to 'image.png'; requesting remote URL; elevating privileges with ShellExecuteW.",
  "flows": "During installation, run() is invoked -> checks admin rights -> downloads 'image.png' from remote server -> decodes and executes its contents.",
  "anomalies": "Download from a suspicious URL; use of exec() on downloaded file; attempt to run as administrator unconditionally; hardcoded URL and headers; reading and executing a potentially arbitrary image file.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the installation process to check for admin rights and potentially relaunch with elevated privileges. It then downloads a file from a specified remote server, writes it as 'image.png', and attempts to execute its contents after decoding from base64. The use of exec() on a file fetched over the network indicates malicious behavior, as it can execute arbitrary code, possibly harmful. The URL and headers seem intentionally obscure, and the code's purpose appears to be covert execution of remote payloads during package installation. The code does not seem to perform any benign or necessary function related to package setup; instead, it covertly executes external code, which is a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, attempting privilege escalation, and using potentially harmful dynamic execution. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
