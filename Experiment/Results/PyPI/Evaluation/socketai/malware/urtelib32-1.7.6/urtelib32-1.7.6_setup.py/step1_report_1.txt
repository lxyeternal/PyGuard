{
  "purpose": "Custom installer that elevates permissions and downloads/executes remote code.",
  "sources": "The code reads local files ('image.png') and downloads remote content via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded content from 'image.png' which is obtained from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "Requests download from remote URL -> writes to 'image.png' -> reads 'image.png' -> decodes and executes content.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads and executes a file from a remote server without validation; uses base64 decoding for execution; attempts to elevate privileges stealthily.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, upon installation, attempts to gain administrative privileges. It then downloads an image file from a specified remote URL with a fixed authorization header. After saving the file locally as 'image.png', it reads and decodes it from base64 and executes the content. The use of 'exec' on dynamically fetched and decoded data indicates malicious intent, as it could execute arbitrary code from the remote server. The privilege escalation and remote code execution are typical malicious behaviors. No legitimate functional purpose is evident for these actions within the provided package context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, decoding, and executing remote code, combined with privilege escalation attempts. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
