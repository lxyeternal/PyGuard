{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that attempts to elevate privileges and download and execute an image file from a remote server.",
  "sources": "Requests to remote URL to download data, reading 'image.png' from disk, and potential user input via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'image.png', executing decoded content from 'image.png' with exec(b64decode(...)).",
  "flows": "Request to download image -> write image to disk -> read image from disk -> decode base64 content -> execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Attempts to gain administrator privileges unconditionally, downloads remote content, executes the downloaded content as code, uses a try-except block that suppresses all errors, and stores the downloaded file as 'image.png' before executing it. The use of 'exec' on the decoded content from an image file is suspicious, as images are typically not executable code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that checks for admin privileges and attempts to escalate privileges if not already admin. It then downloads an image from a specified URL, saves it as 'image.png', and proceeds to read this file, decode it from base64, and execute its content directly with exec(). The use of 'exec' on decoded data from an image file is highly suspicious, as images are not normally executable. The suppression of exceptions with a bare except may hide errors, and the code dynamically executes remote content, which is a significant security risk. The code's primary goal appears to be to run arbitrary code fetched from a remote server during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script attempts privilege escalation, downloads remote content, and executes it without validation, which is characteristic of malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' on data derived from an image file suggests obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a security risk.",
