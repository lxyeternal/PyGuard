      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTTP request utility with proxy support, rate limiting, and proxy rotation. It does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) accurately reflects potential misuse but does not indicate inherent maliciousness. No modifications are necessary; the reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent."
