{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on supply chain security analysis guidelines.",
  "sources": "Code input, data read operations, environment variable access, network connections, file I/O, input parameters",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable usage, system commands, data leaks",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via intermediate processing",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unusual code structures, dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate absence of code, thus no source, sink, or flow analysis is possible. The reasoning in each is consistent; scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately set to zero or near-zero. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on the lack of code. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are detected or inferred. The assessments are justified given the context, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and assign minimal or zero security scores. The evaluations are consistent, justified, and do not warrant modifications. The overall security risk remains negligible, and the likelihood of malicious activity is effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
