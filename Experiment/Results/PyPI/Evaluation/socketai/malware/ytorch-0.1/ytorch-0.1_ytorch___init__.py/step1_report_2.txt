  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or system operation, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input is not explicitly read from standard input, files, or network sources within the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are observable in the code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script with standard functions or operations. It does not include external data sources, dangerous function calls, or code that manipulates system resources in a suspicious manner. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are apparent. The structure and content do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Given the lack of any suspicious code, the risk level remains low.",
