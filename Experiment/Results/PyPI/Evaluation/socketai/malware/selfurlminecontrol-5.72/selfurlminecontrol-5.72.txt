      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, characteristic of malware. The use of base64 encoding, silent execution, and external URL points to malicious activity. The package should be treated as compromised, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
