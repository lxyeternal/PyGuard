  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its heavy obfuscation, system interactions, privilege escalation checks, and package manipulations suggest malicious intent. The high scores for malware (1), obfuscation (1), and security risk (1) are justified. It should be treated as malware, quarantined, and further analyzed in a secure environment."
