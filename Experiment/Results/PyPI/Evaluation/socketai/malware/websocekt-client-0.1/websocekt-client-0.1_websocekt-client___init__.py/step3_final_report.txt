  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, command-line arguments, data read functions",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, eval/exec calls, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or eval/exec functions",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low malicious activity with scores reflecting minimal suspicion. Report 4 notes obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher obfuscation (0.8) and moderate malware suspicion (0.2). Other reports are straightforward with no suspicious features. The scores are consistent with descriptions, but for Report 4, increasing malware score to 0.3 and risk to 0.5 would better reflect the suspicion if dynamic execution is confirmed. Overall, the assessments are appropriate, with the primary concern in Report 4 due to obfuscation and potential dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant cautious review; increasing malware to 0.3 and risk to 0.5 if confirmed would improve accuracy. Current scores are reasonable and aligned with the descriptions.",
