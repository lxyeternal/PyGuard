      "conclusion": "The code is almost certainly malicious, heavily obfuscated to evade detection, and capable of performing system modifications, privilege escalation, and package management actions that could compromise system integrity. The high obfuscation and system API interactions justify a malware score of 0.9, a obfuscated score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9. It should be treated as a high threat and avoided in supply chain contexts until further deobfuscation and analysis are performed."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant cautious review; increasing malware to 0.3 and risk to 0.5 if confirmed would improve accuracy. Current scores are reasonable and aligned with the descriptions."
