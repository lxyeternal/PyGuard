  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata fields, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; setup script does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the script only reads files and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious code. The dependency 'dnspython' is a common library. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores should reflect the absence of issues, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores set to zero. The code and dependencies are standard, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and the absence of detailed reports, there is no indication of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The package appears safe and benign.",
