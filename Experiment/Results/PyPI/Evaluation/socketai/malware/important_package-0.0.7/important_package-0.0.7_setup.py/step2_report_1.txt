  "review": "Let's proceed carefully and systematically, given that all reports are empty and contain no detailed analysis or claims.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**\n   - The provided setup code appears standard and correct for a typical Python package.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code snippets are present.\n   - The dependencies (dnspython) are well-known and widely used; no indication of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty, providing no information about potential issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n   - Without any claims or evidence, there are no logical flaws or errors to critique.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no reports specify issues, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - Any higher scores would be unjustified without evidence.\n\n4. **Potential Risks:**\n   - The only point of concern could be the dependency `dnspython`. However, it is a reputable package, and no known malicious activity is associated with it.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious parts.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Given the lack of any detailed reports or evidence, the safest assumption is that there are no issues.\n   - The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores also at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The package appears standard and safe.\n\nPlease let me know if additional information or specific reports become available for further analysis.",
