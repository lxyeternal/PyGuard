  "purpose": "Collect system information (fully qualified domain name, user home directory, current working directory) and send it encoded to an external URL.",

  "sinks": "request.urlopen() sending data to external server",
  "flows": "Data from sources is encoded, then included as a URL parameter in an HTTP request, which is sent to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try_call with broad exception handling; no validation or sanitization of data; sending potentially sensitive system info over the network without encryption or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as the hostname, user home directory, and current working directory. It encodes this data using base64 and appends it as a parameter to a URL request sent to 'https://pypi.org/reqs'. The request includes a custom Host header that points to a different domain ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'), which might be intended to mask the destination or mimic legitimate traffic. The broad exception handling in try_call can hide errors but is not malicious by itself. The data transmission to an external URL could be used for fingerprinting or privacy invasion, especially if no user consent is obtained.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system details and sends them to an external server without user consent, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. Although it does not execute malicious commands or malicious code directly, it poses privacy concerns and could be part of a malicious supply chain if used with nefarious intent.",
