  "purpose": "Collect system hostname, user home directory, and current working directory, then encode and send this information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.getfqdn() for hostname, os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory",
  "sinks": "request.urlopen() which sends a GET request to an external URL with encoded data, and printing the response object",
  "flows": "Data collected from system functions is encoded in base64 and appended as a query parameter to a URL, then sent over the network via urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks that suppress errors without logging, and the data being sent to an external domain (pypi.org proxy URL) that does not match the data purpose; suspicious URL parameter 'd' with encoded system info",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, home directory, and current working directory, potentially sensitive information, and encodes it in base64. It then constructs a URL with this data as a parameter and makes a GET request to an external server, possibly for data exfiltration. The use of broad exception handling could hide errors, and the URL appears disguised, which might indicate malicious intent. The response object is printed, but not processed, which is typical for covert data transmission. Overall, the code performs benign-looking system info collection but does so in a manner consistent with covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script covertly collects basic system information and sends it to an external server via URL-encoded query parameters, indicating potential data exfiltration behavior. Although it does not execute malicious code or modify files, the pattern of information gathering and external transmission warrants caution.",
