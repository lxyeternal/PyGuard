  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded URLs/credentials, network communication, environment variables, data flows from input to output.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or environment reads leading to eval()/exec() or network communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, inconsistent or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 3 exhibits high suspicion with eval()/exec(), hardcoded URLs, obfuscation, and potential external communication, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, appropriate scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk (~0.2). The confidence scores reflect the certainty of these assessments, with higher confidence in benign reports and moderate confidence in suspicious ones. The overall evaluation aligns with the described behaviors and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3 demonstrates significant malicious indicators, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. The other reports are benign, with appropriate low scores. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided code descriptions and analysis.",
