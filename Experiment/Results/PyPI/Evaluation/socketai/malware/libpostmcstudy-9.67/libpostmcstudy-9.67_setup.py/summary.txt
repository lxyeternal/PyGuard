  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during import, indicating malicious intent. The external domain, obfuscation, and silent execution are high-risk indicators. The scores in reports are appropriate; the package should be flagged for further analysis or avoided until decoded and verified."
