  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear purpose from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user input via input() function, or external files/read functions (not specified in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls (not explicitly shown), which could be exploited if untrusted data reaches them.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or input functions through processing functions to sinks such as file or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code uses standard Python features and libraries. No obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing typical input/output methods and standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities based solely on the visible code. Without additional context or hidden behavior, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to serve a general utility purpose with standard practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified.",
