  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads local variables, standard library functions, and system info; no external untrusted input detected.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file modification, or network connections identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal variables and standard library functions; no suspicious source-to-sink paths observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, utilizing standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.95), given the lack of suspicious indicators and consistent reasoning across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
