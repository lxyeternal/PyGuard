{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup configuration, but it also includes a suspicious code block that attempts to execute a PowerShell command when a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory from the filesystem and potentially executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed is a base64-encoded script which, if decoded, could perform malicious actions such as network communications or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> if not exists, execute obfuscated PowerShell command",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command executed in a subprocess, with no clear benign purpose. The use of encoded commands and conditional execution based on filesystem state are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package configuration, which is normal for package setup files. However, it includes a try-except block that, upon failing to import 'subprocess' or 'os', skips execution, indicating an attempt to execute code that may not always be executed. If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which could be malicious. The command appears to be base64-encoded, which is common for obfuscation. The rest of the script performs a standard package setup with no malicious parameters. The obfuscated PowerShell command is highly suspicious, as it is encoded and executed without clear purpose. The code's overall structure, especially the encoded PowerShell invocation, indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup script with an embedded malicious payload: an obfuscated PowerShell command triggered under specific filesystem conditions. This behavior suggests malicious intent or sabotage, likely aimed at executing hidden malicious code on the host system.",
