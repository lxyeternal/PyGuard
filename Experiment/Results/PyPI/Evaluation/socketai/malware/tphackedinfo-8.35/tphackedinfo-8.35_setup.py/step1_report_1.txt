{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'tphackedinfo', including some obfuscated code that executes a PowerShell command if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The script reads input from the file system ('os.path.exists') and system commands via 'subprocess.Popen'.",
  "sinks": "The 'subprocess.Popen' call executes obfuscated PowerShell commands, which could be used to perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing remote code.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers a subprocess that runs an encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to malicious actions, then proceeds to execute package setup code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command executed without clear purpose, along with the lack of error handling or documentation explaining the intent. The command appears encoded and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with an import from 'distutils.core' and attempts to run a subprocess executing an obfuscated PowerShell command if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and appears designed to hide its true intent, which could be malicious. The setup() call is standard for packaging, with no suspicious parameters. The obfuscated command's purpose is unclear but suspicious due to its encoding and conditional execution, indicating potential malicious behavior such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. Overall, the script combines legitimate setup functionality with suspicious obfuscated code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution triggered conditionally, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The package setup itself appears normal, but the presence of hidden code suggests a supply chain risk, possibly used to execute malicious payloads during installation.",
