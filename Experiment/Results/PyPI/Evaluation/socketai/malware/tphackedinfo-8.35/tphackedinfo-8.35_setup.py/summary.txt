  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation, which could be used for malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or establishing backdoors. The high obfuscation, conditional execution, and suspicious URL comment justify a malware score of 0.85, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9. The package should be considered dangerous and flagged for further investigation."
