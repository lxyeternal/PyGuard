      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload that executes conditionally during setup, referencing a known malicious domain. The behavior indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware download. The current scores are justified, but the overall malware and risk levels should be set very high. The package should be considered dangerous and flagged for removal or further analysis."
