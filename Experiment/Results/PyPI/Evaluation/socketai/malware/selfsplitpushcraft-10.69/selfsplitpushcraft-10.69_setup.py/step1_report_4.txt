{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'selfsplitpushcraft', intended to configure package metadata and potentially execute malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem ('os.path.exists') and imports modules ('subprocess', 'os'). It also uses hardcoded strings within the subprocess call, including an encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could be used to run arbitrary or malicious code if the encoded command is malicious. The 'setup' function is standard and does not by itself pose risk, but combined with the subprocess call, it indicates potential malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file ('tahg'). If it does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell process executing encoded commands, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads. The flow is: check file existence -> execute encoded PowerShell command -> perform setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks with bare 'except' statements suppresses errors, which is suspicious. The embedded PowerShell command is encoded, making it opaque; this often indicates obfuscation. The command appears to download and run external code from 'esquelesquad.rip', a suspicious domain, which is a major indicator of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. If a file named 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is hidden from immediate analysis and suggests obfuscation. The PowerShell command contacts an external domain ('esquelesquad.rip') and downloads content, likely malicious. The use of 'Popen' with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' to run silently and the presence of an encoded command strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at executing remote code or payloads during installation. The setup function is standard, but the preceding code introduces significant security concerns, including remote code execution and potential backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command that contacts a suspicious external domain to download or run malicious payloads during package installation. The use of encoding, silent execution, and error suppression indicates intent to conceal malicious activities. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
