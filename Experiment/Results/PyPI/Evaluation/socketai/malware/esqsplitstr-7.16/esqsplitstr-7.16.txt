      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, potentially malicious payload involving obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup. The behavior strongly suggests malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.8) are justified and reflect a high threat level. Immediate further investigation, decoding of the command, and caution are strongly recommended."
