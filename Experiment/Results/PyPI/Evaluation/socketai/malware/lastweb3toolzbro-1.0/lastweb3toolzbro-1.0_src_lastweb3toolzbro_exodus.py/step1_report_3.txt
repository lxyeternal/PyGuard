{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect a directory named 'Exodus' from the user's AppData Roaming folder, compress it, and then upload it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "User's home directory (~), specifically 'AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus'; remote URL decoded from base64 string.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST request to remote server with the zipped 'Exodus' folder; local file deletion commands.",
  "flows": "Reads the 'Exodus' directory -> Compresses the directory -> Sends the zip file over network via HTTP POST -> Deletes local copies.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-decoded URL points to a suspicious remote server; data exfiltration pattern; no user consent or notification; directory copy and archive without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the user's home directory, decodes a base64 URL, and checks for the existence of a specific folder ('Exodus') in AppData Roaming. If present, it copies this folder to a temporary location, compresses it, and uploads it via HTTP POST to a decoded URL, which could be a malicious or tracking server. The script then attempts to delete the temporary files. The pattern strongly suggests data exfiltration without user consent, indicating malicious intent. No legitimate or benign purpose is evident, and the code is straightforward but with potentially malicious behavior aimed at data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating user data silently to a remote server. The use of base64 encoding for the URL, copying user data, and uploading it without user knowledge are typical indicators of malicious activity. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malware.",
