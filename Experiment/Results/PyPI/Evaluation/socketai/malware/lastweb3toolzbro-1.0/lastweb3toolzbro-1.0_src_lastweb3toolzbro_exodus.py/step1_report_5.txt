{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect user data from the Exodus directory, compress it, and send it to a remote server, likely for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "User's home directory (~) and specifically the 'AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus' directory; reads and copies files from this location.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST request to a remote URL with the collected and zipped data; also involves file deletion operations.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the Exodus directory, copied, compressed, then uploaded via HTTP POST request to the decoded URL; local files are deleted afterward.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding a base64 string that points to a suspicious URL; copying and zipping potentially sensitive user data without user consent; minimal error handling. The URL is obfuscated via base64.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by determining the user's home directory, then decodes a base64 string to get a remote URL. It checks if the 'Exodus' directory exists in the user's roaming profile. If so, it copies the directory to a temp location, creates a zip archive of it, and sends this archive via HTTP POST to the decoded URL. After uploading, it attempts to delete the zip file and copied directory, with silent error handling. The pattern of copying sensitive data, compressing, and transmitting it remotely strongly suggests data exfiltration activity. The obfuscation of the URL via base64 indicates an attempt to hide the malicious intent. The code does not validate the server or confirm the purpose of data collection, and it operates without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears designed to exfiltrate a user's Exodus wallet data to a remote server, likely malicious. Its behavior includes copying, zipping, and transmitting sensitive user data stealthily. The obfuscated URL and silent cleanup further indicate malicious intent.",
