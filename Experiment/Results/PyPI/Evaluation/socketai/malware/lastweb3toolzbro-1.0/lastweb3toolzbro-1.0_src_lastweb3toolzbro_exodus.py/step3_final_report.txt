{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates the 'Exodus' directory from the user's AppData\\Roaming folder by copying, compressing, and uploading it to a remote server decoded from a base64 string, indicating malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory, checks for the existence of 'AppData\\Roaming\\Exodus', and opens the directory for copying.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the ZIP archive via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL, and deletes temporary files.",
  "flows": "Checks for directory -> copies directory -> compresses to ZIP -> decodes URL -> posts ZIP file to URL -> silently deletes temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding to obfuscate the URL; silently handles errors during cleanup; exfiltration occurs without user notification or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a stealthy exfiltration of user data by copying a potentially sensitive directory, compressing it, and sending it to an obfuscated URL. The use of base64 encoding for the URL is a mild obfuscation tactic. The silent cleanup and lack of user interaction suggest malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for data theft, with no validation or safeguards, increasing suspicion. The exfiltration of the 'Exodus' wallet directory indicates targeted data theft, possibly of cryptocurrency wallet information. The code's actions are straightforward but concealed, fitting the profile of malicious exfiltration malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing unauthorized data exfiltration of a sensitive directory using obfuscation techniques. It lacks any legitimate purpose and exhibits stealthy behavior typical of malware. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, with the obfuscation score reflecting the use of base64 encoding. Overall, this code should be classified as high-severity malware with a high potential for harm.",
