{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be collecting and compressing a specific directory, then exfiltrating it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the user's home directory and a specific subdirectory ('Exodus' in AppData\\Roaming). It also reads from the file system when copying and zipping files, and reads the network hook URL encoded in base64.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the zipped archive via an HTTP POST request to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source: Directory path and files in user’s AppData; Sink: HTTP POST request to remote server with the archive file.",
  "anomalies": "The hook URL is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, hiding the destination address. The code copies potentially sensitive data ('Exodus' folder) and sends it over the network without user consent. The use of try-except without logging is also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules. It retrieves the current user's home directory. It then decodes a base64-encoded URL, which points to a remote server. If a folder named 'Exodus' exists within the user's AppData\\Roaming, it copies that folder to a temporary directory, zips it, and sends the archive via POST request to the decoded URL. After transmission, it attempts to delete the temporary files, ignoring errors. The obfuscation of the URL and the exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data without any user interaction or transparency indicates malicious intent. The code's purpose seems to be to stealthily collect and transmit user data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data ('Exodus' folder) by compressing and sending it to an external server. The obfuscated URL and silent operation reinforce the suspicion of malicious activity.",
