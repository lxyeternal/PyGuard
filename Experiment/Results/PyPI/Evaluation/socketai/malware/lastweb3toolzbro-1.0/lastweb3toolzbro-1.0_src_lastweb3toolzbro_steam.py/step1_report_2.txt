{
  "purpose": "The script collects Steam configuration files and SSFN files, compresses them, and uploads them to a remote server, likely for account data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., PROGRAMFILES(X86), TEMP), listing files in the Steam directory, reading files with 'ssfn' prefix, reading Steam config directory, opening the zip file, and opening the zip file for reading.",
  "sinks": "Requests library's post method to send the zip file to a remote server, and file removal operation for cleanup.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> File system (Steam config and SSFN files) -> ZIP archive creation -> HTTP POST request to remote server -> Cleanup (file deletion).",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL that points to a potentially malicious server, collecting and exfiltrating user-specific Steam files, including sensitive SSFN files which are used for account login tokens. The code lacks any user consent or transparency, indicating malicious intent. The code structure is somewhat obfuscated with nested functions and minimal comments.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a remote hook URL and then attempts to locate the Steam installation directory via environment variables. It searches for SSFN files and the Steam config directory, then zips these files into a temporary archive. It proceeds to send this archive to the decoded URL via an HTTP POST request, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user data. Finally, it attempts to delete the temporary zip file. The code's purpose appears to be unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is malicious. No obfuscation techniques are used beyond nested functions and URL encoding, but the intent and actions are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to stealthily gather sensitive Steam account files and send them to an external server, indicating malicious intent focused on data exfiltration. It exhibits no transparency or user consent. Therefore, this code poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
