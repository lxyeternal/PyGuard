{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather specific Steam configuration and SSFN files, compress them, and upload them to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), listing files in the Steam directory, reading files from the Steam config directory, and opening files in the TEMP directory.",
  "sinks": "Request to external server with the compressed data, file deletion from TEMP directory.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file listing → reading Steam config and SSFN files → compressing files into ZIP → uploading ZIP via HTTP POST request → deleting temporary ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding a base64 URL that points to an external server; collecting sensitive Steam data without user consent; sending potentially sensitive files to remote server; lack of user notification or authorization; reading multiple files from Steam directories, which may contain login tokens or sensitive configs.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a URL from base64, likely an attacker-controlled server. It then searches for Steam-related files, specifically 'ssfn' files and the 'config' directory, which can contain user credentials, login tokens, or other sensitive data. It zips these files and uploads them to the specified URL, then attempts to delete the temporary ZIP file. The behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information related to Steam. No user notification or permission prompts are included. The code does not contain obfuscation, but the intent to secretly collect and transmit user data suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing unauthorized collection and transmission of potentially sensitive Steam data to an external server, indicative of malicious data exfiltration behavior. The absence of user consent, the targeting of specific sensitive files, and the silent transmission to an external URL confirm malicious intent.",
