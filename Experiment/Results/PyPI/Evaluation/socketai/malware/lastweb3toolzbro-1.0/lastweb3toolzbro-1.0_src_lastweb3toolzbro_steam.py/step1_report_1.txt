  "purpose": "The script appears to collect and exfiltrate Steam configuration and SSFN files, compresses them into a zip archive, and sends this archive to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), listing files in the Steam directory, reading files from the Steam config directory, opening and reading files in the zip archive, opening the zip file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Requests library's post method to send the zip file to a remote URL, file system's remove method to delete the temporary zip file.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and directory listing -> Reading Steam config and SSFN files -> Creating zip archive -> Sending zip archive via HTTP POST request -> Deleting temporary zip file.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL which, when decoded, points to an external server, possibly for exfiltration. The code does not verify the content or legitimacy of the remote URL. It automatically zips and uploads sensitive Steam data without user consent. No user input validation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string to obtain a URL, which appears to be an external server endpoint. It checks for the existence of the Steam directory in the Program Files (x86) path, then searches for files starting with 'ssfn' and the Steam config directory. It defines a function to walk through these directories and write files into a zip archive. The zip archive is then uploaded via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL. Afterwards, it attempts to delete the temporary zip file. The behavior indicates data collection and exfiltration of Steam credentials and configuration files, which are sensitive and private. The code operates stealthily without user interaction or notification.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data stealer targeting Steam user credentials and configuration files. It covertly packages and exfiltrates sensitive data to a remote server. The absence of any user prompts, the decoding of a suspicious URL, and the automated collection of private files suggest malicious intent.",
