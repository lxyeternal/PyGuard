{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64 URL to an external server, searches for Steam configuration and 'ssfn' files in Program Files (x86), packages these files into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request. It operates silently without user consent, indicating malicious intent for data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., PROGRAMFILES(X86), TEMP), listing files in Steam directory, reading 'ssfn' files, reading 'config' directory, opening ZIP file, reading the ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to send the ZIP archive to an external server, os.remove() to delete the temporary ZIP file.",
  "flows": "Source: File system and environment variables -> ZIP archive creation -> HTTP POST request to external server -> deletion of temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding for URL obfuscation, silent data collection without user notification, collection of sensitive Steam files including login tokens ('ssfn'), minimal error handling, operating in the background.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a suspicious URL, searches for sensitive Steam files ('ssfn' and 'config'), packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the archive to an external server without user consent. It then deletes the temporary ZIP file. The code's behavior aligns with malicious data theft. The URL is obfuscated via base64, but the overall structure is straightforward. The code targets sensitive user data, operates stealthily, and communicates with an external server, indicating high malicious intent. The use of environment variables and file operations are standard, but combined with the exfiltration behavior, they pose a significant security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive Steam configuration and login token files to an external server without user consent. It employs minimal obfuscation (base64 URL) and operates stealthily, representing a high security risk and malicious activity. The behavior warrants classification as malware with maximum risk scores.",
