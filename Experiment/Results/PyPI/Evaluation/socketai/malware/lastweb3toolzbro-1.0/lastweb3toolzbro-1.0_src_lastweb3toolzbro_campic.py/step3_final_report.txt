  "purpose": "Capture a single frame from the default webcam and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0), cap.read()",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite()",
  "flows": "VideoCapture -> read -> imwrite",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward webcam capture and save operation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam capture, reads a frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The code is standard and benign, with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign webcam snapshot utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate; minor overestimation of security risk in one report should be corrected to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
