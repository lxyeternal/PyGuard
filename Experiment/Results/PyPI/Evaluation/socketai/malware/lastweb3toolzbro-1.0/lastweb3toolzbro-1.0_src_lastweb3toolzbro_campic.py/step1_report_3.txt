  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default webcam and save it as image.png",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0), cap.read()",

  "flows": "cap.read() (source) -> cv2.imwrite (sink) with the frame data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; standard webcam capture and image saving",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam capture, reads a single frame, saves it as an image file, then releases resources. Uses standard OpenCV functions without any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No input validation or external data sources that could be malicious. No data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The code performs a simple capture-and-save operation typical for image capture applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward webcam capture and image save operation with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
