  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot, encode a URL, and upload the screenshot to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads user directory path, captures screenshot via ImageGrab, opens and reads the saved image file.",
  "sinks": "Sends the image file via HTTP POST request to the decoded URL.",
  "flows": "Captures screenshot -> saves to temp path -> opens file -> sends file in POST request to URL decoded from base64.",
  "anomalies": "Decodes a URL from base64 and immediately posts data to it without user consent or validation. No user input validation. Saves image to a temp location without cleanup if an error occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the current screen image and saves it locally in a temp directory. It then decodes a base64-encoded URL, which appears to be a remote server. The image file is uploaded to this server via a POST request. The URL is hardcoded and obfuscated, and the data transmission is done without user knowledge or consent. The code attempts to delete the temp image file after sending, but it suppresses exceptions silently. Overall, the code is designed to silently capture user screenshots and send them to a remote server, which could be malicious if used without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs silent screenshot capture and uploads to a remote server without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The URL is obfuscated, and the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious. It may be part of a spying or data theft activity.",
