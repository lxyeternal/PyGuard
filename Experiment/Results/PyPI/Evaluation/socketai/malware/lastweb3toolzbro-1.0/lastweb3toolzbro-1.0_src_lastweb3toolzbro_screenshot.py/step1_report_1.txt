  "anomalies": "Decoding a base64 string to obtain a URL, capturing and exfiltrating a screenshot without user consent, minimal error handling, no user prompts",
  "analysis": "The code captures a screenshot using PIL's ImageGrab, saves it locally, then sends it via HTTP POST to a URL decoded from base64, which is suspicious as it exfiltrates user screen data to an external server. The URL is obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to conceal the remote endpoint. It deletes the screenshot after sending. No user interaction or permission checks are present. The obfuscation and data exfiltration behavior point to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates the user's screenshot to a remote server without consent, indicating malicious behavior. The obfuscation of the URL and silent operation are typical of malicious exfiltration tools.",
