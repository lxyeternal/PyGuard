  "flows": "os.path.expanduser -> ImageGrab.grab -> save image -> open image file -> requests.post -> delete image file.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding a base64-encoded URL that points to a remote server, capturing and exfiltrating screen data without user consent, no error handling for network failures.",
  "analysis": "The code captures a screenshot using PIL's ImageGrab, saves it temporarily in the user's Temp directory, and then sends the image via a POST request to a URL decoded from base64. The URL appears to be a remote server, which could be used for exfiltration of sensitive visual data. The code does not provide any indication of user consent or notification. It deletes the temporary image file after sending. The use of base64 decoding obfuscates the destination URL, which is suspicious. There are no obvious signs of hardcoded credentials or backdoors, but the behavior suggests data exfiltration. The code could be malicious depending on the context and intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script captures the user's screen and transmits the image to a remote server, indicating potential malicious exfiltration activity. The obfuscation of the server URL and the silent operation increase suspicion, although the code itself does not contain overt malicious commands beyond data exfiltration.",
