  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data by copying, compressing, and uploading it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads Telegram session data from user's AppData directory, specifically '\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata'.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the ZIP archive via HTTP POST request to a URL decoded from base64, which acts as the exfiltration endpoint.",
  "flows": "Checks for session data -> copies data to temp folder -> creates ZIP archive -> reads ZIP file -> posts data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "URL is base64-encoded (obfuscation); function call is commented out, preventing execution unless explicitly activated; no other malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration routines targeting Telegram session files. The URL obfuscation via base64 is a mild form of concealment. The function is currently inactive, reducing immediate risk, but the structure indicates intent for malicious activity. The code uses standard libraries with no advanced anti-analysis techniques. The malicious pattern is clear, and the potential for harm is high if activated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for malicious exfiltration of sensitive user data, specifically Telegram sessions. Although the exfiltration function is commented out, the structure and obfuscation suggest intent. The scores should reflect high malicious potential, slightly adjusted downward due to current inactivity, but overall remain high given the potential risk.",
