  "purpose": "The code appears to extract and exfiltrate Telegram session data and upload it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads user home directory for Telegram session data; reads the temporary ZIP file before upload.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST request to an external URL decoded from base64.",
  "flows": "Checks for Telegram data -> copies data to temp folder -> zips data -> reads ZIP file -> sends data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding for URL, copying potentially sensitive Telegram session data, and sending it externally. The function is defined but commented out, indicating potential obfuscation or intent to disable/enable malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports OS and requests modules, then decodes a base64 string that resolves to a suspicious URL. It defines a function 'telegram' that, if activated, copies Telegram session data to a temp directory, compresses it, reads the ZIP file, and uploads it via HTTP POST to the decoded URL. The function call is commented out, which might suggest concealment. The process involves extracting sensitive session data and transmitting it externally, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data by copying, compressing, and uploading it to a remote server. The URL is obfuscated via base64. The function is defined but not invoked, possibly to evade detection, but the logic indicates malicious data theft behavior.",
