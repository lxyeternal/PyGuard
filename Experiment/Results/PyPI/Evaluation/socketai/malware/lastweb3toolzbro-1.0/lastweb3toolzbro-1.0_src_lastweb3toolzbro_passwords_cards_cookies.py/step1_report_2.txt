{
  "purpose": "This code appears to extract sensitive user data such as passwords, credit card information, cookies, browsing history, and downloads from various browsers and then uploads this data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA), user directories for browsers, Local State files, database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, Downloads) in browser profiles.",
  "sinks": "Writing extracted data to temporary files, creating zip archives, uploading files via HTTP POST request to a remote hook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser profile databases and local state files (sources), decrypted, formatted, saved locally, compressed, and then sent over the network to the remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any user interaction, prompts, or checks; it silently copies sensitive databases, decrypts data, and uploads it without user consent. Use of base64-encoded URL for remote endpoint, aggressive copying and deleting of browser data, and automated data exfiltration are suspicious. Also, the script attempts to hide its actions by collecting numerous types of data stealthily.",
  "analysis": "The script loads browser data paths from environment variables, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows cryptography functions, and retrieves browsing history, downloads, and credit card info. It creates a directory structure in the temp folder to store and archive this data, then uploads the archive to a remote server via a POST request. The use of Windows-specific cryptography, comprehensive data collection, and silent uploading strongly indicate malicious intent and data theft. The code does not include any user confirmation, logging, or indication of legitimate purposes. It primarily targets Windows environments with Chromium-based browsers. No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward, but it performs malicious data exfiltration and thus is malicious in behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as malware designed for stealthy data harvesting from browsers and sensitive user information, then exfiltrates this data to a remote server. It contains no benign features, and its primary intent is malicious data theft.",
