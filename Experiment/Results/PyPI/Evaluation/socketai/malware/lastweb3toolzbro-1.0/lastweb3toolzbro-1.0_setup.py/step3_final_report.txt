  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package info, dependencies, and package discovery via find_packages('src').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, uses find_packages with a source directory, and lists dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, environment variable manipulations, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The dependencies are common packages ('requests', 'Pillow', 'pywin32') and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is clear and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The inclusion of 'pywin32' suggests platform-specific usage but is not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
