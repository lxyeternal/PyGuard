{
  "purpose": "The script searches user data directories for Discord and browser tokens, then sends the collected tokens to a specified remote server via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), file system reads from browser and application data directories, and log/DB files in specific paths.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a remote webhook URL with token data embedded in JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and file contents to find tokens, collects tokens, then posts token info to a remote server via requests.post().",
  "anomalies": "Decodes a base64-encoded URL that appears to be used as a webhook endpoint; searches for Discord tokens in user data; exfiltrates tokens without user consent; no authentication or user notification; uses environment variables for paths; no error handling or validation; sends data directly to external URL.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive Discord tokens from various user data directories associated with browsers and applications. It searches for specific regex patterns that match Discord tokens and MFA tokens within log, database, and local storage files. The code then compiles these tokens into a JSON object and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL decoded from base64. The absence of user consent, error handling, or encryption indicates malicious intent, typical of token-stealing malware or spyware. The use of environment variables and direct file access are typical techniques for data harvesting malware. The hardcoded URL (decoded from base64) suggests command-and-control or exfiltration endpoint, which is typical in malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to clandestinely harvest Discord tokens from user directories and exfiltrate them to a remote server, demonstrating malicious behavior typical of credential-stealing malware. The absence of user notification or consent, combined with its purpose and data exfiltration method, indicates a high malicious intent.",
