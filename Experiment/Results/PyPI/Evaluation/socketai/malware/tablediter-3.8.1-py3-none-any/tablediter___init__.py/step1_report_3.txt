{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports modules and functions related to table data processing and exports certain identifiers for external use.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (importlib.metadata), local package modules (.edt, .tablediter), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the module's namespace, with no external data ingestion or manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The use of importlib.metadata to obtain version info is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, which is typical for a package's __init__.py. It retrieves package version info using importlib.metadata, a standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious logic. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any apparent sinks that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured for a package's initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__.py that manages imports and version info. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
