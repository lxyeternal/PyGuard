{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports various constants, functions, and classes related to table processing, importing components from other parts of a package and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "import statements for local modules (.edt, .tablediter) and importlib.metadata for version retrieval",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or inputs; only static imports and module metadata access",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; module metadata is read from package environment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It retrieves version info via importlib.metadata. There are no functions, user input handling, or dynamic code execution present. The code structure and syntax are straightforward, typical for Python module initialization files. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leaks, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for exposing functions and constants with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and typical for open-source Python projects.",
