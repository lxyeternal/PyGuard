{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module (__init__.py) that imports various constants, functions, and classes from local modules (.edt, .tablediter) and exposes them via __all__. It also retrieves its own version using importlib.metadata.version(__name__).",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules (.edt, .tablediter) and version retrieval via importlib.metadata.version(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and metadata access occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py that imports constants, functions, and classes, then exposes them via __all__. It also retrieves its version info using standard library functions. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network operations, or data processing. The code is static, clear, and adheres to common Python packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
