{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be a part of a Python package that imports and re-exports functions, classes, and constants related to table iteration and handling, likely for data processing or formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.edt, .tablediter) and importlib.metadata to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security issues; no untrusted data handling or execution occurs.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and classes, then exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses standard import and export practices without hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and defines the __all__ list for exports. It retrieves the package version using importlib.metadata. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data, no data transformations, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. All activities are consistent with typical package initialization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign part of a Python package intended for data/table handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
