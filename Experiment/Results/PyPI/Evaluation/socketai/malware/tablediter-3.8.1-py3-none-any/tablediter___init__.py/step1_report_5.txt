{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export a set of table-related functionalities and constants, including importing submodules and functions, and setting version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements: __future__ import, relative imports (__future__, .edt, .tablediter), importlib.metadata for version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing, no network, file system, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; mainly static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard package structure and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, module exports (__all__), and retrieval of version info using importlib.metadata. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no untrusted input handling are present. The code follows standard Python package practices with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package module defining exports and version info, with no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
