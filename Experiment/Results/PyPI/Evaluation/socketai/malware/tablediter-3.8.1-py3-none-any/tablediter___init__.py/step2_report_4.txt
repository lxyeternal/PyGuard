  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard module that re-exports constants and functions, retrieves version info. No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard import and export pattern, version retrieval via importlib.metadata, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero; perhaps considering the use of importlib.metadata as a minimal risk, but generally safe.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores and reasoning are appropriate. The minor security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect cautious acknowledgment of potential metadata access, but overall, the code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard package __init__.py pattern, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no apparent issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard import/export, version retrieval, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Basic module setup, no untrusted data, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is justified given the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero, as no obfuscated or dynamic code is present.\n- The slight security risk scores (0.1) in some reports seem to be cautious notes rather than indicating real vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — the code is a typical package __init__.py with no security risks.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard module initialization file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern indicators. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
