{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module that imports various functions and constants related to table processing and serialization, and exposes them via __all__ for external use. It also retrieves its own version number using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own name (__name__) to determine the package name for version retrieval, and imports local modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to pass any untrusted data to sensitive sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows involving untrusted input; the code mainly performs static imports and module metadata retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The version retrieval from importlib.metadata is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and constants from local modules related to table iteration and export formats, then re-exports them via __all__, allowing external modules to access these symbols. It retrieves the package version dynamically via importlib.metadata.version(__name__), which is a standard way to get the package version in Python 3.8+ and does not introduce any malicious behavior. There are no signs of code obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup and metadata retrieval implementation with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package, providing interface constants and functions for table processing.",
