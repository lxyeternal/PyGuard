  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring consistency, and justification for high-risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive table rendering utility supporting multiple formats, with extensive styling options. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. It uses standard libraries, and the functions operate within their scope.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a legitimate, feature-rich library for table formatting. No evidence of malicious activity or code injection. The validation routines and standard library usage support this.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code reads data from CSV, JSON, HTML, and database cursors, with no signs of malicious behavior. The functions are standard, and no network or external system calls are evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is a safe, well-structured parser and formatter library. The absence of network, system, or malicious code is well established.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles data input and output in multiple formats, with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is potential XSS in HTML output if data is malicious, but this is typical for such libraries.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code does not perform network or system commands, and the use of escape() mitigates injection risks. No backdoors or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0-0.2. The given 0.0 for malware and 0.2 for risk seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate table parser and formatter, with potential for HTML injection if data is malicious, but uses escape() to mitigate. No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The only concern is that embedding untrusted data into HTML could lead to XSS, but this is standard for such libraries, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is a feature-rich table utility, with no network or malicious system calls. The main risk is in potential misuse with untrusted data, but the code itself is safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected. The mention of potential risks with untrusted data is fair, but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No code exhibits malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection mechanisms.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard concerns about untrusted data in HTML/serialization contexts, but no actual malicious code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified. No code indicates malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct; code is readable and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable considering potential XSS in HTML output if data is malicious, but this is typical for such libraries and not a security flaw per se.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — standard concern about untrusted data in output formats, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is a legitimate, safe, and useful table formatting library with no evident security threats.",
