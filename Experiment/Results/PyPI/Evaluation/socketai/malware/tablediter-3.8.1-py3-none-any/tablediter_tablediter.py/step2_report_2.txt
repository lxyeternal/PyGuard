  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a comprehensive table rendering library supporting multiple formats, with data input via parameters and options via kwargs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Outputs are string formats; no network or system actions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. The code uses standard libraries and handles data safely.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious intent, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data parsing from CSV, JSON, HTML, etc.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external system calls; data flows within the library.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses standard libraries; no malicious code injection or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, safe, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The very low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on data formatting and exporting; no external data modification beyond serialization.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Outputs are formatted strings; no network or system commands.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors or obfuscation; standard libraries used; escape() mitigates injection risks in HTML.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the risk and malware scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with parsing and formatting functions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential for XSS in HTML output if data is malicious, but mitigated by escape().  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or backdoors; standard libraries; potential XSS is a common concern, but not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, well-structured, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; the low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functionality; data from user input, files, or database, then formatted for output.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data serialization into formats that could be exploited if data is malicious, especially in HTML or CSV outputs.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, but potential for XSS if untrusted data is embedded into HTML without sanitization. The code uses escape() in HTML output, which is good practice.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, low risk, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The potential for XSS is a standard concern but not malicious sabotage. The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or unsafe operations are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly about potential XSS in HTML outputs if data is untrusted.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (small potential for XSS if data is malicious, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The existing scores are reasonable and well-justified based on the code review. The detailed reasoning in each report aligns with the actual code behavior, which is a legitimate, open-source table formatting library with no malicious intent.",
