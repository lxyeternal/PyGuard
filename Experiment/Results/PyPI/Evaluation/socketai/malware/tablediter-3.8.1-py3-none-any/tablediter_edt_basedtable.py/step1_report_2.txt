  "anomalies": "Constructs a file path based on system info and user login, then executes it without validation. No explicit hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, but dynamic execution of potentially arbitrary files is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a filename based on system info and a random string, then checks if this file exists in the current working directory. If it does, it executes this file using the current Python interpreter. The execution command differs for Windows and other systems. The purpose seems to be to run a specific script if present, which could be benign or malicious depending on what that file is. No explicit malicious code or obfuscation detected; however, dynamically executing files based on system info without validation is a security concern, as it could facilitate malicious payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script dynamically constructs a filename and executes it if present, which could be used maliciously to run arbitrary code without user awareness. It lacks validation and could be a vector for executing malicious scripts stored under system-generated filenames.",
