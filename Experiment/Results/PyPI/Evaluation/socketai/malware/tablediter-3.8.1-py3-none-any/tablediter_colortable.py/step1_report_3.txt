{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for theming and coloring tables in terminal output, including handling ANSI escape codes and themes.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, relative import of tablediter, optional import of colorama, and class attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Usage of ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring, method calls on super() (potentially untrusted data if overridden), and string formatting for theme codes.",
  "flows": "Initialization of themes -> setting theme property -> update_theme method applies color codes -> get_string appends RESET_CODE.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code uses ANSI escape sequences which are standard for terminal coloring. The theme formatting logic is straightforward and safe. The only point of concern could be external data passed into theme parameters, but no direct untrusted input is processed here.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define theming structures and formatting for terminal output. It uses standard ANSI escape sequences and safe string formatting. There are no external data inputs being read from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. The use of optional colorama import is safe, wrapped with try-except. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and serves as a theming utility for terminal tables. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
