{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for theming and coloring tables in console output, utilizing ANSI escape codes for color formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports colorama for terminal color initialization; reads theme and color configuration from class attributes and constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses ANSI escape codes to format terminal output; does not write untrusted data elsewhere or connect to external resources.",
  "flows": "Theme attribute configuration flows from class instantiation to update_theme method, which applies color codes to internal character properties for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The only external dependency is colorama, which is properly conditionally imported and initialized.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes terminal color themes and applies ANSI escape sequences to style table components. It includes safe handling of color codes and conditional import of colorama for cross-platform compatibility. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code’s purpose is aesthetic formatting, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign theming utility for console tables with no signs of malware or security risks. It employs standard practices for ANSI coloring and dependency handling. No malicious intent detected.",
