{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for theming and styling text output, particularly for tabular data, using ANSI escape sequences for color formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama, class initializations, and static method 'format_code' which processes color code strings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data or user input handling identified that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Color code strings from themes flow into formatting functions and are applied to table elements, but all data appears controlled within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard for styling terminal output and does not contain suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages color theming for terminal output using ANSI escape sequences. It includes safe static methods and property setters that do not execute untrusted input. External library 'colorama' is used only for initialization, and there's no user input or external data processing. The theme management and string formatting follow standard practices without any obfuscated or suspicious code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The code structure is straightforward and does not present any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for styling terminal output with color themes. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
