  "purpose": "Defines theming and styling for terminal output using ANSI escape sequences.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input, external data, or network activity; theme parameters are static strings.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or effects; no untrusted data processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Static theme parameters are formatted via format_code; no dynamic data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static theming utility for terminal styling with safe string handling and conditional import of colorama. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing that could pose security risks. The ANSI escape sequences are used appropriately, and the theme parameters are controlled. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward terminal theming utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for supply chain inclusion.",
