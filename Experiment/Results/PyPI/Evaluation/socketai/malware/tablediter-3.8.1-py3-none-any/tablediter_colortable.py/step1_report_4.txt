{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for rendering colored tables in terminal output, including themes and color formatting.",
  "sources": "Import of colorama (optional), input parameters for theme configuration, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is processed or output in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; color codes are formatted and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic execution or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes optional terminal color support, defines theme configurations, and applies ANSI escape codes for styling. It uses static strings and class attributes without any dynamic or untrusted input processing. The only input parameters are default color strings, which are sanitized and formatted through a dedicated method. No external data sources or network communications are present. The code seems to be for aesthetic purposes only, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless utility for styling terminal tables. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. It is a standard implementation of color theming with no suspicious elements.",
