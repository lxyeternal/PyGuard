      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state, with suspicious comments and silent error handling. These are strong indicators of malicious activity, warranting high malware and risk scores. The overall security risk is significant, and the package should be treated with caution until the payload is decoded and analyzed further."
