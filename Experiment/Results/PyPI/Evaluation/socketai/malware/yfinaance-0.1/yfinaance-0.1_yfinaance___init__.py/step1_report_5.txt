{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import standard libraries and execute a simple operation, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read from user input, environment variables, or files.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects are present; no external network connections or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code performs isolated operations without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; there are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of basic import statements and a simple arithmetic or data manipulation operation. It does not include user input handling, network communication, or file access. No unusual patterns or security-sensitive functions are detected. Its structure and content are consistent with benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a harmless, standard piece of code.",
