  "purpose": "A simple Python print statement with no external dependencies or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data sources; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code only outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code executes a benign print statement directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'Hello world' print statement with no inputs, dependencies, or complex logic. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature, with consistent scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the scores. No anomalies or obfuscation are observed, and the code aligns with standard benign examples.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security risk or malicious threat. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring appropriately reflects the code's harmless nature. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
