      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and likely malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows. The use of encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and runtime code execution are classic indicators of malicious activity, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided."
