  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'Simpjson' Python package with custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, requests, fernet, and the exec statement decrypting and executing remote code.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decrypted code, network request via requests module, use of environment variables (os.name).",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypts payload -> executes decrypted code via exec() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted code payload executed via exec(), use of decrypting with Fernet and a hardcoded key, obfuscated variable names and description content, suspiciously long description and author name, setup requires 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used in the malicious code execution path.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a package called 'Simpjson' with standard setup parameters. It includes a custom install class that overrides the run() method. Inside run(), if the operating system is Windows (nt), it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted payload via exec(). This payload likely contains malicious code, as the use of Fernet decryption and exec() during installation suggests an attempt to run remote or hidden malicious code. The long description appears to be random or obfuscated, further indicating suspicious intent. The script’s core malicious component is the dynamic execution of decrypted code during installation, which could be used for malware delivery or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior: during installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code dynamically, likely for malicious purposes. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution method point to a supply chain attack or backdoor. The package should not be used.",
