{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'Simpjson' with a custom installation process that conditionally executes malicious code on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, the 'os.name' property, and potentially external dependencies like 'requests' and 'fernet' for decryption and network communication.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec()', network requests through 'requests' library, and use of 'Fernet' decryption which may be used to hide malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input sources include environment check (os.name), 'requests', and 'fernet' decryption key. The flow proceeds to execute decrypted code if on Windows, representing a potential malicious payload being executed during install.",
  "anomalies": "The 'long_description' appears obfuscated or nonsensical. The 'exec()' call decrypts and executes code from a Fernet-encrypted payload, which is suspicious. The package description and author information are generic and possibly fake. The code uses a custom 'install' class that runs additional code during installation, which is not standard for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures but includes a malicious backdoor mechanism in the custom 'install' class. It checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code from a hardcoded Fernet key, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads at install time. The long description is gibberish, possibly to evade detection. Usage of 'exec()' with decrypted payloads is a significant indicator of malicious intent. Dependencies like 'fernet' and 'requests' are declared but could also be used maliciously for network communication and payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a hidden malicious backdoor that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The obfuscated and suspicious code, combined with the execution of decrypted payloads, indicates high malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
