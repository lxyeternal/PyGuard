  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'Simpjson', including custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports external libraries, and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() during installation on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts and executes code during the install.run() method if on Windows, which could be triggered during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during install; the long description appears obfuscated or nonsensical; arbitrary key and encrypted data used in Fernet decryption.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process by defining a custom install class that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via Fernet encryption during installation. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, and the execution occurs via exec(), which is a significant security concern. The long description content appears obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious intent. The decrypted code's purpose is unknown but could be malicious, such as executing arbitrary code or payloads. Usage of a hardcoded Fernet key and executing decrypted code at install time is suspicious and typical of malicious packages intending to run hidden payloads. There is no evidence of benign functionality in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, which poses a security risk. The encrypted payload and execution method suggest malicious intent, such as executing hidden malicious code during setup. This package should be considered unsafe.",
