  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'Simpjson', including custom installation behavior that executes decryption and code execution on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), and loads encrypted data which is decrypted and executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes decrypted code which is loaded from an encrypted string, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an embedded payload, and executes it with exec(), creating a source-to-sink path from environment detection to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed at install time, dynamic import of potentially unnecessary modules, long, obfuscated-looking description strings, and custom install class with embedded decryption and execution logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation class. In the custom class, during run(), it checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(). The payload is embedded as a base64-encoded encrypted string, which when decrypted could contain malicious code. The code's purpose appears to be executing arbitrary code at installation time, which is suspicious. The description strings are nonsensical, possibly obfuscation or placeholder data. The use of Fernet encryption and dynamic execution is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. These factors strongly suggest malicious intent, or at minimum, highly suspicious behavior designed to evade static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payload execution during installation, which is a high-risk behavior. It appears designed to run arbitrary code upon package installation, especially on Windows systems. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or supply chain sabotage, indicating a high security threat.",
