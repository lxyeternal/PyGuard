  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'Simpjson' Python package with custom install behavior that decrypts and executes code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (os, requests, fernet), reads environment info (os.name), decrypts and executes code via Fernet.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "Imports os; if os.name is 'nt', requests and Fernet are imported; then Fernet decrypts a payload and executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload is used with Fernet and executed directly, indicating potential obfuscation. The long description appears random and meaningless. The code executes decrypts code only on Windows; this targeted behavior is suspicious. setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used at runtime, and these dependencies are necessary for the decryption/execution process.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command class that, during installation, checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key to obtain code, which it executes directly. This behavior could be malicious, especially since the decrypted code is not visible or verified. The presence of encrypted payload and execution based on environment indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent. No other malicious behaviors like network connections or data theft are evident. The long description appears intentionally obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious intent. The code's core malicious activity is the runtime decryption and execution, which could execute arbitrary malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated behavior through encrypted payload and runtime execution, which is highly suspicious. It is likely malicious or at least maliciously designed to execute arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. The script could facilitate remote code execution, backdoors, or malware payloads. Caution is advised before using this package.",
