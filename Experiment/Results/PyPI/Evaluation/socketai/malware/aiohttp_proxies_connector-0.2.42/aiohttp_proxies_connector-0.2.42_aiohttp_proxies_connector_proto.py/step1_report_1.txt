{
  "purpose": "The code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided hostnames, ports, and optional credentials (username, password). Data is received from the network via socket operations and from address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from network responses (e.g., proxy server replies), user inputs (hostnames, credentials) potentially used in request construction, and address resolution outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, ports, credentials) through address resolution and request construction, then via network socket communication to the proxy server, and finally to the destination host.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code includes standard proxy negotiation procedures. No suspicious or unnecessary dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Exception handling is typical for network code. No suspicious network domains or data leaks are observable.",
  "analysis": "The code implements SOCKS proxy clients with standard practices: resolving addresses, negotiating authentication, and establishing connections. It uses async network operations properly, with error handling for common network issues. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious commands. The code performs expected functions for proxy communication without suspicious modifications or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection setup securely and appropriately, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
