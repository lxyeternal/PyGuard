{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for network connections, handling negotiation, authentication, and connection setup to proxy servers.",
  "sources": "Reads input from host and port parameters, socket operations, and user credentials (username, password, user_id).",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connection, data transmission, and reception; potentially sensitive data like host addresses, ports, and credentials.",
  "flows": "User credentials (if any) are used during SOCKS5 authentication; host and port information flow into connection requests; data is sent and received via socket operations during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution. No signs of backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious data handling. No suspicious DNS or IP address handling outside expected proxy operations.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to standard practices for implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols. It correctly manages socket creation, connection, and negotiation steps, including handling authentication. It does not perform any suspicious operations such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification. The use of standard libraries and proper exception handling indicates normal functionality. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with its intended purpose as a proxy client, and no malicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles proxy negotiation and data transmission securely and properly. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling within this module.",
