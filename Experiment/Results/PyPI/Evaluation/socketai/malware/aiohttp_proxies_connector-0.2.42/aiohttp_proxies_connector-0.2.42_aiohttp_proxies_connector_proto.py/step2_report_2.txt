  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess their scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's function as SOCKS proxy client implementations, with data flowing from user inputs and DNS resolution into network communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states that the code appears legitimate with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, proper handling, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 also reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on legitimate proxy connection handling, with no suspicious data or control flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 align well.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates standard implementation, proper use of asyncio, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms legitimate proxy wrappers, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** The code is a straightforward SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, the low risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** All reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- **Potential adjustments:** None needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard proxy code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior.",
