  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code content.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices for network communication.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), aligning with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code appears functionally correct and does not contain evident bugs or vulnerabilities.\n- No issues with address resolution, authentication, or connection flow are reported or apparent.\n- No signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical flaws or mistakes.\n- The code handles exceptions properly, especially during network operations.\n- The only minor note is that in `Socks5SocketWrapper._socks_auth`, the construction of the username/password request uses `chr(len(self._username)).encode()`, which is correct but could be more straightforward with `struct.pack`. However, this is not a flaw but a coding style choice.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The code does not implement any security measures beyond standard proxy negotiation, but given its purpose, this is acceptable.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No suspicious network behaviors or data leaks are evident.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code performs expected functions for a SOCKS proxy client.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The consistent malware and obfuscated scores of 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard network code, minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware signals.",
