{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to facilitate proxy connections in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hostnames and ports for destination servers, and local address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be sent over network sockets, particularly in methods like _send, negotiate, and connect, which send data to proxy servers or destination addresses.",
  "flows": "Source data from hostname or IP address is processed and sent through _send methods during the negotiation phase in connect() and negotiate(). Resolved addresses flow from _resolve_addr to socket communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard socket and asyncio usage with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. There are no obfuscated parts or unusual code patterns. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident. The code performs typical proxy negotiation without any apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS proxy connection wrappers, handling DNS resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It includes robust error handling and uses asyncio for asynchronous socket operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware indicators. It primarily provides a proxy connection layer. The code appears well-structured and consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio applications, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It performs typical network proxy negotiations securely and transparently. No supply chain threats or malware indicators are present.",
