  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior with the claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report claims the code is a standard SOCKS4/5 implementation with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows. It assigns malware score 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code matches this description. It performs typical proxy negotiation, address resolution, and authentication. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate; the obfuscated score of 0 is justified. The security risk is low, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing proper implementation of SOCKS protocols, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code aligns with this description. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection correctly, with no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2. These are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code implementing SOCKS proxies with standard operations, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs legitimate proxy connection steps, with proper error handling and address resolution. No signs of malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is straightforward, using standard socket and asyncio operations for proxy negotiation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1. These are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's standard proxy behavior, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and typical network flows.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code matches this description, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—standard proxy client implementation without malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, which is consistent given the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0, mostly 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security risk due to network operations, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — standard network code with typical risks associated with network communication, not due to malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning and scores are consistent with the code's actual behavior. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
