  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/5 proxy client implementation, with no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, as expected for a standard proxy client)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct protocol handling, no malicious behaviors, and standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and prior analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment, with no suspicious activities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Also aligns well with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the implementation's correctness, standard socket and asyncio usage, no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (even lower, indicating very low risk)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing legitimate proxy behavior, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the code's transparent proxy functionality.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard for proxy client code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
