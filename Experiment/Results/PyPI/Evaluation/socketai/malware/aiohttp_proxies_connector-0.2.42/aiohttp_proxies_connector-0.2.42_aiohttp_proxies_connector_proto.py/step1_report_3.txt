{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for establishing proxy connections asynchronously, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and data received over network sockets. Data is read during socket connections, address resolution, and proxy negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send and receive operations, especially where untrusted data could be written or read. The code writes data to sockets for proxy negotiation, including user credentials if provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) to socket connection and negotiation methods. Untrusted data from DNS resolution or input credentials flows into socket requests and responses, which are then processed and potentially sent or received over network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code performs standard proxy connection procedures with appropriate error handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are detected. The import of potentially unsafe modules (asyncio, socket) is standard for network operations and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured implementation of SOCKS proxy protocols with proper address resolution, authentication handling, and error management. It does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor features. It performs legitimate proxy connection tasks with comprehensive exception handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. Usage of network sockets and address resolution appears to be for intended proxy communication, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous network communication. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. Its design is consistent with standard proxy client behavior, with thorough error handling and address resolution. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
