  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client functionality, including connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input hostnames/IP addresses, user credentials (optional), network socket connections, DNS resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket communication for proxy negotiation, address resolution results, potential data sent over network.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames/IPs, credentials) -> DNS resolution or IP conversion -> Proxy negotiation requests -> Authentication (if needed) -> Connection establishment -> Data transmission over socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Proper exception handling and standard protocol implementation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation using asyncio and socket libraries. It performs address resolution, proxy negotiation, and optional authentication without any signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code handles exceptions appropriately and uses standard network protocols. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are detected. The malware score is justified as 0, indicating no malicious intent. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical network communication code. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring provided in the reports is accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
