  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio. It handles untrusted inputs securely, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the analysis. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is minimal risk and appears safe for use."
