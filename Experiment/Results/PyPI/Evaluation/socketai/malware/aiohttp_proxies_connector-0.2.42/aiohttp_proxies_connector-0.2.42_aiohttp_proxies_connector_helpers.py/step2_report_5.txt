  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard proxy handling, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code securely parses proxy URLs, handles credentials, and creates socket wrappers for SOCKS proxies. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Given the absence of any malicious indicators, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with standard proxy code.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard proxy connection setup, high confidence (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is consistent, with proper validation and handling of inputs. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains 0, security risk low (0.1–0.2), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy functions, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code handles input parameters securely, uses standard libraries, and performs expected operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified; security risk is low.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, legitimate proxy connection code, high confidence (0.95), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Proper validation, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate and consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy utility functions, no signs of malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Assessment:** Standard handling of proxy URLs and socket creation, no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Justified as malware-free.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are detected in the code snippets. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, legitimate proxy connection setup.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent. All reports consistently interpret the code as benign.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, matching the absence of malicious behavior. Security risks are low, reflecting typical proxy handling code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** The reports correctly assume that untrusted input (proxy URLs, credentials) are handled securely, with proper parsing and validation. No assumptions about malicious intent are unjustified.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n- **Malware justification:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, there's no evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports and code analysis).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard proxy connection handling without significant security concerns.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy connection utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1 – 0.2       |\n\n**All reports are accurate in their assessment, and no modifications are necessary.**",
