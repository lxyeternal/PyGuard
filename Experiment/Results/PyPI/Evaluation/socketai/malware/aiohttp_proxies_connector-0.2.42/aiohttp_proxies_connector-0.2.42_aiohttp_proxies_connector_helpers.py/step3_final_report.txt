{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse proxy URLs, create SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, and establish network connections via asyncio, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; host and port parameters in open_connection and create_connection; untrusted proxy URL and credentials inputs.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection using the socket; potential data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters → parse_proxy_url (extract proxy type, host, port, credentials) → create_socket_wrapper (create socket wrapper based on proxy type) → connect socket → open_connection or create_connection (use socket to establish network connection).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Proper validation and error handling are in place.",
  "analysis": "The code securely parses proxy URLs, handling missing or invalid components, and creates appropriate socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies. Connection functions validate input parameters, handle untrusted inputs with standard validation, and establish connections via asyncio. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External libraries used are standard and presumed legitimate. Error handling is appropriate, and the code's structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio. It handles untrusted inputs securely, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the analysis. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is minimal risk and appears safe for use.",
