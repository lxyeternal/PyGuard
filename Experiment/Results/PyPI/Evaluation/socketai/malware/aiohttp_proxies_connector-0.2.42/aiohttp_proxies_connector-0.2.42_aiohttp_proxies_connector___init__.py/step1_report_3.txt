{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a proxy connection library, including importing various classes, functions, and constants related to SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious code execution; the code primarily sets up exports",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources; mainly import statements and module setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code constructs observed; the code is straightforward module setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions related to proxy connections and errors, and then exposes them via __all__. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. The code serves as a module interface or API setup, not executing any network or system commands. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or unusual behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization file for a proxy-related package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the public API for the package.",
