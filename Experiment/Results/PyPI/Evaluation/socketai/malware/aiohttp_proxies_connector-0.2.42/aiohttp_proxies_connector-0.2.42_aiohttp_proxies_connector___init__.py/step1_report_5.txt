{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connection handling, including importing modules, defining package version, and exporting public API components.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and components within the package, no external data sources or user input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or outputted; mainly module imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up package exports and imports internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initializer, importing internal modules and defining the package API. It does not execute any runtime logic, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident in this fragment. It serves to organize and expose components for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script without malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and exposes internal modules and constants for the package. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
