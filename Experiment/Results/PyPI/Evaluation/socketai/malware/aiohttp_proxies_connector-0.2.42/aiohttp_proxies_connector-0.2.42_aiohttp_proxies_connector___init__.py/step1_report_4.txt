{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a Python package related to proxy connections, including importing classes and functions from submodules and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no external data handling or network operations in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports classes/functions and sets export variables; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No unusual code or behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific components and defines __all__ for exports. It only manages internal references and module metadata without performing any data processing, network activity, or user input handling. The absence of dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious imports indicates no malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package that manages proxy-related functionalities. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors and is focused solely on organizing and exporting components.",
