{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides a proxy connection interface, including error handling and connection utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), which are likely internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward import statements, a version string, and an __all__ declaration. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy handling and error management from internal modules, defines a version string, and specifies public API exports via __all__. It functions as a module initialization or interface setup. No data input/output, external network activity, or potentially malicious operations are present. The structure and content appear standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a Python package related to proxy connections. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
