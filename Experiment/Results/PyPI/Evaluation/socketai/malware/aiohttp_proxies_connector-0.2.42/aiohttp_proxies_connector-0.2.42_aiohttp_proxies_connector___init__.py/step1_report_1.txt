  "purpose": "This code module appears to be part of a SOCKS proxy client library, setting up imports and exposing certain classes and functions related to proxy connections and errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), which are internal dependencies within the package.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or external interactions are performed directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; this code primarily defines imports and package exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. The code structure is standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The module imports various components and defines __version__ and __all__, typical for a Python package. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or system modifications within this fragment. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code is straightforward, mainly serving as an interface to other parts of the package.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign part of a proxy client library, serving as an initializer and exposer of classes/functions. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected in this fragment.",
