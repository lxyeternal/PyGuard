{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a SOCKS proxy client library, importing internal components and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from internal module imports (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing internal modules and defining __version__ and __all__, with no data or control flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package setup module, importing internal components and defining the public API. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and transparency support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
