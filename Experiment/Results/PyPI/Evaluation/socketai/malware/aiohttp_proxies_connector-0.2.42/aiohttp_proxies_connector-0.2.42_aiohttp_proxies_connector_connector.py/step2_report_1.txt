  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with support for custom proxy types, credential embedding, and socket wrapping.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- Proxy URL construction and socket connection logic follow common patterns.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or malicious code detected.\n- The use of custom socket wrappers and URL parsing functions is typical in proxy implementations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nThe report states that the code is a standard proxy connector with no malicious intent, and no obfuscation or backdoors are present. The confidence is high (0.95). The malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.1.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThis aligns with my review. The code appears benign, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate, minimal risk due to user input reliance)  \n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nSimilar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no secrets, and no malicious behaviors. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nConsistent with my assessment. No issues.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nAgain, describes standard proxy connector implementation, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) due to potential misuse if user inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to proxy configurations, not code flaws.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThis is reasonable. The code relies on external inputs, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (acceptable, considering user input risks)\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nStates the code is standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The only concern could be the custom socket wrapper, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgrees with my findings. The socket wrapper's legitimacy depends on its implementation, but nothing suspicious is apparent here.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Analysis:**  \nNotes that the code is a typical proxy connector, with no malicious intent. Highlights that malicious proxy URLs could pose risks but are outside the code's scope.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThis is accurate. The code facilitates proxy connections but does not itself introduce malicious behavior.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All 0, no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential risks associated with user-supplied proxy data, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a proxy connector.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- The primary security concern is reliance on external, potentially malicious proxy URLs, which is inherent to proxy usage, not a flaw in the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My recommended scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score   | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity or payload present.                      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, no obfuscation techniques used.                 |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2     | Slight risk if untrusted proxy URLs are used; inherent to proxy configuration. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation. The only potential concern is how proxy URLs are supplied, but that is outside the code's scope and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of specific functions or further analysis.",
