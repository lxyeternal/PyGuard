  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malware detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score is justified, given that the code handles proxy configurations securely and transparently.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no secrets, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The use of parameters and URL formatting is typical. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard proxy connector with configurable options, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still justified, considering the potential misuse if malicious proxy URLs are provided. The code itself is not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the proxy connector's standard implementation, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The only concern is reliance on external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), but their implementation isn't shown. Assuming they are standard or secure, the risk remains low.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the standard nature of the code, with no malicious intent, but notes that malicious proxy URLs could pose security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code itself isn't malicious, but the use of untrusted proxies could lead to man-in-the-middle or data interception issues. The code doesn't perform malicious actions but could be exploited if used maliciously.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.2 is justified; malware and obfuscation remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly at 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if malicious proxy URLs are used. This is reasonable, as the code itself isn't malicious but could be exploited.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — a modest risk due to potential misuse of proxy configurations, but not inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified in their scoring. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy connector with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk scores appropriately reflect the potential for misuse but do not indicate inherent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No further action needed.",
