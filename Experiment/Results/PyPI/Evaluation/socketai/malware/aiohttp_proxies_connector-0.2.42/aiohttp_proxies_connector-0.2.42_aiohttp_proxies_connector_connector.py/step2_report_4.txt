  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard proxy connector with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and a malware score of 0. The logic involves constructing URLs with credentials and creating socket wrappers, which are typical operations.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious code or malicious activity detected. The confidence level (0.95) is appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** The score of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 is justified. Security risk is low (~0.1). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, URL construction, and socket creation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code's behavior aligns with typical proxy implementations.\n- **Recommendation:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on dynamic proxy URL creation, proxy configuration, and socket handling. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the use of custom socket wrappers and proxy configuration. No suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. The code appears legitimate and safe.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that the code is a typical proxy connector, noting potential risks if malicious proxy URLs are used, but clarifies that the code itself isn't malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is correct. The security concern is about external input, not code behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** The malware score remains at 0; the security risk is low but depends on input validation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting typical proxy handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code implements a standard, well-understood proxy connector with support for various proxy types and optional credentials. It employs typical URL construction, socket wrapping, and connection logic. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The potential security concern is external — malicious proxy URLs or untrusted inputs — but this is outside the code's scope and not a flaw in the implementation itself.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (depending on input validation practices)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation. The reported assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
