{
  "purpose": "The code implements a proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting various proxy types, credential embedding, custom DNS resolution, and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from user-provided proxy URL, parameters for proxy configuration, and socket creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include URL construction with credentials, socket connection, and proxy request updates, which could lead to data leakage if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL and parameters are parsed and used to construct proxy URL; socket wrapper is created and connected; connection proceeds through the super class methods, with proxy URL and socket passed along.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of helper functions and dynamic URL formatting are standard. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector, with proper URL handling, socket wrapping, and connection logic. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The risk mainly depends on external proxy URL trustworthiness, not the code itself. The code's structure and logic are clear and align with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects typical proxy configuration risks, which are outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
