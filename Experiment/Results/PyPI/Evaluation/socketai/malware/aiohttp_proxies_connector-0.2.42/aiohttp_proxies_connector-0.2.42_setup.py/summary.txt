  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits all hallmarks of malicious activity: decoding and executing obfuscated payloads, environment-based stealth, network and system manipulation functions, and process hiding. The high confidence in these indicators warrants classifying this as highly malicious, with maximum severity scores."
