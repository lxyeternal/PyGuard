  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and compare them with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are observed. This assessment aligns with the original code, which is purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and lacks any suspicious elements. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident. The summaries are thorough and correctly interpret the purpose of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1, and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0. This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince all scores are 0, and the code is straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious behavior, no higher risk scores are justified. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting that the code is only defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate for the described benign, straightforward exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, transparent set of custom exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No modifications to the scores or interpretations are necessary.",
