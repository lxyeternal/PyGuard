{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present; exception classes are defined but not instantiated or used.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; classes are simply defined without further logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains the definition of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The code does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activities. It appears to be a straightforward set of exception class declarations with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger codebase.",
