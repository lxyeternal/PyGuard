  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n   - No data input/output, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code appears to be a standard pattern for error handling in a SOCKS proxy implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with confidence 1, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These assessments are accurate given the code snippet. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These seem reasonable because the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious content.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code does not exhibit any security risk or malware potential.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - This is appropriate and justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (benign, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy for error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and typical for error handling in a Python project involving SOCKS proxies. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
