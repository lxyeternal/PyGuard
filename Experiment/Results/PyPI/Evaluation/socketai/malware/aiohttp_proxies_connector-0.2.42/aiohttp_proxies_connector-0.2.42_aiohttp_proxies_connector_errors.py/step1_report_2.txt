  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; this code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing functions present; exceptions are just class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output operations; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is standard for custom exception classes in Python, with clear naming indicating error types related to SOCKS proxy errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. Overall, the code appears benign and serves a typical purpose.",
