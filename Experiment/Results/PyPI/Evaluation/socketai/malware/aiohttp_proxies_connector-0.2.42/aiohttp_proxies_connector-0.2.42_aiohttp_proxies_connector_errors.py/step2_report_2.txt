  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, network interactions, or executable logic. The reports correctly identify this and do not find any anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and without security issues. They are consistent and accurate given the code snippet. No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. These are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk. Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is a benign part of an error handling framework.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity or code behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — The code is straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### **Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
