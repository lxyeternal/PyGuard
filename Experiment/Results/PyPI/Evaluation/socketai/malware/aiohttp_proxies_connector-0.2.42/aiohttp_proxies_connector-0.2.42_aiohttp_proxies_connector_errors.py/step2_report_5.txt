  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, network interactions, or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy setup.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Purpose: accurate\n  - Sources/Sinks/Flows: none, correctly identified\n  - Anomalies: none\n  - Analysis and conclusion: consistent and reasonable\n  - Confidence: 1\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is justified.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n- No risk scores need to be increased.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is only class definitions; this is accurate.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Scores (My Judgment):**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. The reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation in this code snippet. It serves a typical purpose within a larger codebase, and the analysis aligns with this assessment.",
