{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, serving as a structured error management framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions; no data input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; purely structural exception hierarchy.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance does not involve data transfer or execution flow beyond exception hierarchy setup.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data handling, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no executable logic or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely for error categorization, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy for SOCKS proxy error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and justified, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
