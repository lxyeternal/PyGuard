  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "None, as this code only contains class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The structure appears to be part of a larger error handling framework, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as part of a larger application or library for SOCKS proxy error management.",
