{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no data processing or handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions without any execution logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, serving as custom exception types for a SOCKS proxy implementation. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic; no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy setup for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions without any malicious intent, data handling, or security issues. It is a typical pattern for organizing error handling in Python.",
