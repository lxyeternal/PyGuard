{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; these are class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are solely for error categorization and raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception classes, primarily for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are standard in structure, serving as error markers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the code appears to be part of an error management system. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated code detected. Overall, the code is a benign, typical implementation of custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of simple exception class definitions used for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and standard.",
