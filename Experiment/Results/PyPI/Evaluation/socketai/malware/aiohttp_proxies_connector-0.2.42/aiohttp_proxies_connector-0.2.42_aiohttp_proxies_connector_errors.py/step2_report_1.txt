  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, network communication, hardcoded secrets, or executable logic.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty based on the code snippet.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is benign, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities, increasing the risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for error handling, with no suspicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based solely on the code provided.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about hidden behaviors are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and serves a typical purpose in error handling for a SOCKS proxy implementation. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
