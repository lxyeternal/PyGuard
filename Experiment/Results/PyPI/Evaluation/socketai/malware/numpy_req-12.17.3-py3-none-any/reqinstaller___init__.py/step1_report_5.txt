  "purpose": "Download an executable from a remote URL and execute it locally.",
  "sources": "requests.get() reading data from a remote URL, tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() creating a temporary file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> temporary file write -> subprocess.call() with the temporary file path.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from an external source and executing it without verification; no checksums, signatures, or validation performed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves an executable file from a remote Discord CDN URL, saves it temporarily, and runs it directly using subprocess. This behavior is highly suspicious, as it downloads and executes code without any validation, raising serious security concerns. The code structure is straightforward, but the intent to execute an external binary directly is indicative of potentially malicious behavior, such as executing malware or unwanted software. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present beyond the malicious pattern itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, as it downloads an external executable and runs it without any validation. It could be part of a malware delivery chain or malicious activity. The overall security risk is high.",
