  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the local module 'coloramas_file', which could be malicious or a mimic of 'colorama'. The use of wildcard imports is discouraged but not malicious. Further review of 'coloramas_file' is recommended to confirm its safety. Overall, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a modest security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to naming suspicion."
