  "purpose": "Import all from a local module 'coloramas_file' and the third-party 'colorama', then initialize colorama settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module 'coloramas_file' and 'colorama'; call to initialize() function.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential concern if 'coloramas_file' contains malicious code or backdoors.",
  "flows": "Import from 'coloramas_file' and 'colorama' -> call to initialize()",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious similarity of local module name 'coloramas_file' to 'colorama'; use of wildcard imports ('import *') which reduce clarity and could hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module 'coloramas_file' and the external 'colorama' library, then calls 'initialize()'. The local module's name closely resembles 'colorama', which could be an attempt to mimic or shadow the legitimate library, raising suspicion. The use of 'import *' is poor practice but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The call to 'initialize()' is standard for 'colorama'. Given the lack of concrete malicious behavior, malware score is set to 0. The main concern is the suspicious naming, which warrants further inspection of 'coloramas_file'. The security risk score is low but slightly elevated due to potential deception, estimated around 0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the local module 'coloramas_file', which could be malicious or a mimic of 'colorama'. The use of wildcard imports is discouraged but not malicious. Further review of 'coloramas_file' is recommended to confirm its safety. Overall, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a modest security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to naming suspicion.",
