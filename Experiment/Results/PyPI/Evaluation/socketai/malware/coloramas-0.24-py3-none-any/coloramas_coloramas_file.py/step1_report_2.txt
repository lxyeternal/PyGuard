{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and zip sensitive wallet-related files and information from a user's system, then send this data to a specified Telegram bot, potentially for malicious purposes such as data theft or credential harvesting.",
  "sources": [
    "getpass.getuser() - retrieves current username",
    "os.getenv() - retrieves environment variables for paths",
    "os.path.exists() - checks existence of specific files/directories",
    "requests.get() - retrieves external IP and country code"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "requests.post() - sends data and files to Telegram bot API",
    "ZipFile.write() - writes sensitive files into archive"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "User system data is collected from environment variables and specific paths",
    "Sensitive files related to Exodus wallet are checked and added to a ZIP archive",
    "Zip archive is sent over the network via Telegram API, including external IP and country info",
    "The ZIP archive is deleted locally after transmission"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID",
    "Collection and exfiltration of sensitive wallet files without user consent",
    "Use of external IP API to track user location",
    "Repeated try-except blocks without specific error handling, implying attempt to silently handle failures",
    "Constructing messages with potential for misleading or malicious context"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code starts by retrieving user information and setting up paths to wallet-related files. It then checks if certain directories or files exist, indicating potential wallet data presence. If found, it creates a ZIP archive and adds multiple sensitive files, such as 'exodus.conf.json', 'passphrase.json', 'seed.seco', and others, along with some user documents. It constructs a message containing user info and geolocation data, then sends this data as a document to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token and chat ID. The code then cleans up by deleting the ZIP archive locally. The overall behavior suggests data exfiltration of sensitive wallet information, likely malicious, especially given the hardcoded credentials and the silent collection of user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exfiltrates sensitive wallet files and user information to an external Telegram bot, indicating malicious intent aimed at data theft. The use of hardcoded credentials, collection of wallet data, and transmission over the network strongly suggest malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high due to the covert data collection and exfiltration mechanism.",
