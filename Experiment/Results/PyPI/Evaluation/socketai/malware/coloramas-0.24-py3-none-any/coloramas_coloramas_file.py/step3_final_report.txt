{
  "purpose": "The code collects specific wallet and system files related to Exodus wallet, creates a ZIP archive of these files, retrieves external IP and country code, and exfiltrates this data along with a constructed message to a hardcoded Telegram bot, effectively performing malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "File existence checks for wallet files and configuration files; environment variables for user directories; network requests to ip-api.com for IP and country info.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents; network transmission of exfiltrated data; writing files to ZIP archive.",
  "flows": "Source: File reads and environment variables → Data collection and message construction → External IP and geolocation retrieval → Data exfiltration via Telegram API → ZIP archive creation and transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; broad try-except blocks with suppressed errors; collection of sensitive wallet files without user consent; no validation or encryption of exfiltrated data.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly targets wallet-related files and system info, constructs a ZIP archive, and sends it along with a message containing IP and geolocation data to a Telegram bot. The use of hardcoded credentials and silent error handling indicates malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs covert exfiltration of sensitive data. The network requests for IP and country info are used to enrich the exfiltrated message. The overall behavior aligns with malicious data theft, with high confidence in its malicious nature. The broad try-except blocks suggest attempts to avoid crashing, typical in malware. The hardcoded credentials and the nature of data collected confirm malicious exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covertly exfiltrating wallet and system data via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials, silently collects sensitive files, and transmits them without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, with high confidence and high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~1, obfuscated 0) are justified and accurate.",
