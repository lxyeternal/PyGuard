{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect specific files related to Exodus wallet data, compresses them, and then sends them via Telegram, possibly for backup or exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), user input via getpass.getuser(), and external HTTP requests to ip-api.com for IP and location info.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to ZIP files, and files are sent through Telegram's API endpoints for message and document delivery.",
  "flows": "The code reads wallet-related files and environment variables as sources, compresses them into a ZIP, then sends the ZIP and a message via Telegram API calls as sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive wallet files and environment data without user consent, then exfiltrates this information through Telegram, which is suspicious. The use of try-except blocks around file writes and network requests could hide errors. Hardcoded Telegram bot token is a significant security concern.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user-specific wallet files and environment data, packages them into a ZIP archive, and sends this archive along with a message to a Telegram chat. It retrieves the current public IP and country code, encodes the country flag, and includes it in the message. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and the collection of sensitive files suggest malicious intent, such as credential theft or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but focuses on data collection and exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious behaviors in malware. The extensive use of try-except blocks could be to conceal errors or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and environment info via Telegram, with no user consent. The hardcoded token and targeted file collection strongly indicate malicious intent, potentially as part of credential theft or targeted data exfiltration.",
