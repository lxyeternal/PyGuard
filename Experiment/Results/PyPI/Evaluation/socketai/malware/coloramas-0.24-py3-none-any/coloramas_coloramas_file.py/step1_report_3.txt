{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user data, including wallet files and system information, and exfiltrates it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User's environment variables, file system paths related to Exodus wallet, external IP address via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages and files to Telegram API endpoints, writing ZIP files containing sensitive data, reading environment variables and files.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system paths and environment variables (sources), then written into a ZIP archive, and subsequently uploaded via Telegram API calls (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, concatenation of sensitive file paths with user-specific data, collection of multiple wallet-related files, and sending this data externally without user consent. Use of broad try-except blocks obscures errors, indicating potential malicious intent. The code also constructs messages with wallet details and IP info, indicating data harvesting for unauthorized access.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by retrieving the current user's username and environment variables to build file paths related to the Exodus wallet. It uses hardcoded credentials (Telegram bot token and chat ID) to exfiltrate data. It searches for specific wallet files and sensitive configuration files, then compresses any found files into a ZIP archive. It also fetches the system's public IP address and country code, converting the country code into emoji flags, and constructs a message including these details. The script then uploads the ZIP archive and message to a Telegram chat, which could be used for malicious data theft. The presence of hardcoded tokens, collection of sensitive wallet files, and data exfiltration points strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a malicious data exfiltration tool targeting Exodus wallet users. It harvests sensitive wallet files, configuration, and system information, then secretly uploads them to an external Telegram chat. The hardcoded credentials and broad error handling further indicate malicious activity. Overall, this code poses a high security risk and should be considered malicious.",
