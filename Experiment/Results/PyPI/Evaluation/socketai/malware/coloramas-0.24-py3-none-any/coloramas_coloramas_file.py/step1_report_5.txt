  "purpose": "The code appears to collect certain user-specific files and system information related to Exodus wallet data and send it to a remote Telegram bot, possibly for backup or malicious exfiltration.",

    "getpass.getuser() - retrieves username",
    "os.getenv() - retrieves environment variables such as LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP",

  "analysis": "The code primarily collects user-specific wallet files and system information, then packages these files into a zip archive. It then sends this archive along with a message containing the user’s IP address, country code, and a flag-based country representation to a predefined Telegram bot. The hardcoded token and chat ID indicate a fixed malicious target, and the exfiltration of wallet files suggests malicious intent. The code's structure and purpose point toward clandestine data theft, potentially for unauthorized access or fraud. The use of try-except blocks that suppress errors could hide failures or anomalies, but the core functionality aligns with malicious exfiltration of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, as it exfiltrates wallet-related files and system information to an external Telegram server without user consent. It employs hardcoded credentials and targets sensitive files, indicating malicious intent. It is recommended to treat this code as malicious and avoid executing it. The overall security risk is high due to data theft and privacy invasion.",
