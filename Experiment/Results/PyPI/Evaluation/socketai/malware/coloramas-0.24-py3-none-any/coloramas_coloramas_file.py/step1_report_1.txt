{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive wallet data and configuration files from the user's system, package them into a zip archive, and then upload the archive and a message containing IP and location information to a Telegram bot. Its purpose seems to be data exfiltration of wallet and system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment variables for user directories, accesses specific files related to Exodus wallet (e.g., exodus.conf.json, wallet data, seed, passphrase, two-factor info, and related files), and retrieves the system's external IP address and country code via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "The data is written into a zip file, which is then read and sent as a document via Telegram's API. Additionally, a message with system info and geolocation data is sent as a text message to the same Telegram bot, leading to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, wallet/config files, and IP location requests. Data flows into a zip archive created locally, then out to an external Telegram bot endpoint both as a document and message, revealing sensitive information externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code combines multiple sensitive wallet files and system info, packages them into a zip, and exfiltrates without user consent. The hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are suspicious. Use of try-except blocks around file writes with no error handling is unusual. The code also retrieves and sends IP/geolocation data actively, which is typical in malicious exfiltration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user-specific wallet and configuration files related to Exodus, packages them into a zip file, and then uploads both the archive and a message containing IP and geolocation info to a Telegram bot. The inclusion of hardcoded bot token and chat ID, combined with the collection of sensitive data without user interaction or consent, suggests malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application functions; instead, it facilitates stealthy data theft. The use of environment variables, file path manipulations, and network requests are consistent with a covert data exfiltration mechanism, possibly malware or a malicious scraper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to exfiltrate wallet and system data to an external attacker via Telegram. The hardcoded credentials, targeted files, and network activity indicate malicious intent with high confidence. It should be regarded as malware and blocked from execution.",
