  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covertly exfiltrating wallet and system data via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials, silently collects sensitive files, and transmits them without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, with high confidence and high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~1, obfuscated 0) are justified and accurate."
