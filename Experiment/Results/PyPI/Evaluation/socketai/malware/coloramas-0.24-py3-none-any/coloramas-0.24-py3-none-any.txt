      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covertly exfiltrating wallet and system data via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials, silently collects sensitive files, and transmits them without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, with high confidence and high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~1, obfuscated 0) are justified and accurate."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the local module 'coloramas_file', which could be malicious or a mimic of 'colorama'. The use of wildcard imports is discouraged but not malicious. Further review of 'coloramas_file' is recommended to confirm its safety. Overall, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a modest security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to naming suspicion."
