  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated remote PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, contacting a suspicious domain. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified by the evidence. It warrants further analysis of the decoded command but should be treated as high risk."
