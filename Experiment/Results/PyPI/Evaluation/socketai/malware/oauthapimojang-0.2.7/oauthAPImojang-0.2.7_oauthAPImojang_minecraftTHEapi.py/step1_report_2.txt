{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract Discord tokens and sensitive information from the user's system, gather system details, and send this data to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser profile directories, local storage files, environment variables, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected tokens and user information via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Reads tokens from local storage files, decrypts them, verifies tokens with Discord API, then collects and sends user and system data to an external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code operates stealthily by accessing browser data, decrypting tokens, and transmitting sensitive user data without user consent. It uses hardcoded URLs for webhook delivery, employs system commands for hardware info, and does not inform the user.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing various modules for data handling and system interaction. It defines functions to decrypt encrypted data, retrieve IP address, hardware ID, and Discord tokens from browsers' local storage. It decrypts and verifies tokens with Discord API, collecting detailed user info, including email, phone, MFA status, and Nitro subscription status. It then constructs a detailed embed message with all the data and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The script operates silently, accessing sensitive data and transmitting it externally. The use of decryption, system commands, and network requests all indicate malicious intent focused on stealing user tokens and personal data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a token grabber and data exfiltration tool targeting Discord users. It stealthily extracts tokens, decrypts them, verifies user info, and transmits sensitive data to an attacker-controlled webhook. The purpose is clearly malicious, with no legitimate functionality present.",
