{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, user account details, and system information, and then send this data to an external webhook URL, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA'), accesses various browser profile directories and local storage files, reads files in LevelDB directories, and reads environment variables ('UserName', 'COMPUTERNAME'). It also captures system data using 'wmic' command and reads local state files for encrypted keys.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to Discord API to verify tokens, and posts collected data to a remote webhook URL via a 'Request' with JSON payload containing user info, tokens, and system details.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens from browser storage, decrypts them, uses tokens to access Discord API endpoints to gather user data, system info, and then constructs a detailed report which is sent to an external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded URLs for Discord webhooks, uses deprecated or insecure methods for decryption, and reads sensitive directories and environment variables for potential user data. The overall structure resembles a token-stealing and data exfiltration tool.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables, accesses browser profiles and storage files to extract potential Discord tokens, decrypts these tokens, then uses them to authenticate requests to Discord API to retrieve user details. It also gathers system information like IP address, username, PC name, and hardware UUID. The data collected includes tokens, user info, and system details, which are formatted into a Discord message embed and exfiltrated via a webhook. The code includes obfuscated or at least non-trivial decryption routines, but nothing strongly suggests obfuscation beyond typical cryptographic handling. The primary activity is data theft and exfiltration of sensitive user information. There are no signs of system damage, reverse shells, or other malware behaviors like cryptomining. Overall, this code functions as a token grabber and information stealer targeting Discord users, with exfiltration to a remote webhook.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a malicious token stealer and information exfiltration script targeting Discord users. It collects tokens, user account details, and system information, then sends this data to an external webhook URL. The activity is consistent with a credential harvesting malware, with no indications of other malicious actions such as system damage or cryptomining. It is highly suspicious and should be considered dangerous.",
