{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious Discord token and user info stealer, decrypting stored tokens from browser profiles and local storage, verifying them via Discord API, collecting user and system data, and exfiltrating this information to a hardcoded webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads local files from browser directories, local storage files, environment variables, and executes system commands such as 'wmic' to gather hardware IDs.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to a specified Discord webhook URL; verifies tokens through Discord API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens from local storage, decrypts them using Windows API, verifies tokens with Discord API, collects user info, system info, and hardware IDs, then exfiltrates all data via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded webhook URL, decrypts tokens with Windows-specific API, accesses multiple browser profiles and local storage files, and executes system commands without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically reads from browser and local storage directories, decrypts stored tokens, verifies their validity with Discord API, and gathers extensive user and system information. It then exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled webhook. The presence of hardcoded URLs, decryption routines, and system commands indicates malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions typical of credential theft malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, functioning as a token and data stealer targeting Discord users. It exfiltrates sensitive information without user consent, posing a high security threat.",
