  "purpose": "Initialize the MinecraftSkyblockAPI package by importing all contents from the minecraftTHEapi module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .minecraftTHEapi import *",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can obscure imported content and potentially import malicious or unintended code, but by itself does not imply malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization file that imports all definitions from another module within the package and explicitly exposes it via __all__. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or network activity. The use of wildcard import is a minor concern for code clarity but not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package initialization with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The use of wildcard import should be noted for maintainability but does not raise security concerns.",
