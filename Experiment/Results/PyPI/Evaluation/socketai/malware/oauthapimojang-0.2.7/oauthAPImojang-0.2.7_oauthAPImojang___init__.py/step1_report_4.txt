  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace by importing all contents from the 'minecraftTHEapi' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .minecraftTHEapi import *",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; code only imports a module and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can be risky for namespace pollution and obscures actual imported contents, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports all symbols from the 'minecraftTHEapi' module and defines __all__ to include it. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The use of wildcard import is generally discouraged but not malicious. There is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple package initializer with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports a module and defines the export list. No malicious or suspicious code detected.",
