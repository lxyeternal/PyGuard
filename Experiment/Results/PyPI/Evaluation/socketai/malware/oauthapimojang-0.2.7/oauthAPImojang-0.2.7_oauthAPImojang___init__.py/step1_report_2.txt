  "purpose": "This module initializes the package by importing all contents from the 'minecraftTHEapi' submodule and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything from the '.minecraftTHEapi' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import from '.minecraftTHEapi' -> exposing via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure what is imported; no explicit handling of data or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as an __init__.py to make 'minecraftTHEapi' available at the package level. The use of 'import *' can be considered a potential issue for clarity, but it does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and common in Python packages, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
