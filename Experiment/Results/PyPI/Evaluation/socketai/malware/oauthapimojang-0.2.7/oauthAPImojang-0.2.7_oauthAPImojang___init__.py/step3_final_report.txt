  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing all contents from the submodule 'minecraftTHEapi' and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .minecraftTHEapi import *' reads the submodule's contents.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source is the submodule 'minecraftTHEapi'; the flow is the import into the package namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *') is generally discouraged for maintainability but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports everything from a local module and exposes it via __all__. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The use of 'import *' is a known Python anti-pattern but does not constitute a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting maintainability concerns rather than security issues. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is benign and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'import *' is a maintainability concern but not a security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
