  "purpose": "Initialize the MinecraftSkyblockAPI package by importing all contents from the minecraftTHEapi module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .minecraftTHEapi import *'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or data output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident; this code only performs a package import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered bad practice as it can import unintended code, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all elements from a local module 'minecraftTHEapi' and sets the __all__ list to include only 'minecraftTHEapi'. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or external network interactions. The use of wildcard import could potentially mask malicious imports if the module contains malicious code, but on its own, this code snippet is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple package initializer with no signs of malicious intent. The use of wildcard import is a questionable practice but not malicious by itself. Overall, no security risks are evident from this snippet.",
