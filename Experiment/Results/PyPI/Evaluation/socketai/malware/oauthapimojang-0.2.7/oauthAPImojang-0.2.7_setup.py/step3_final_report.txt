  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() call, dependencies listed in install_requires",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are common packages; 'pywin32' is Windows-specific but not suspicious. No network activity or code injection detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
