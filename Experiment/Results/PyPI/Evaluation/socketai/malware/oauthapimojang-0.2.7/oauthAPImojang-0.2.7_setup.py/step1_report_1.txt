  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'oauthAPImojang' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code: the setup() function call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; no sinks that lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable: no data flow from source to sink, as this is a static setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Dependencies listed are common Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, lists dependencies ('pycryptodome', 'pywin32', 'requests'), and calls setup() with these parameters. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or obfuscated code present. The dependencies are widely used and do not suggest malicious intent by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and dependencies are legitimate. No evidence of malware or security risks.",
