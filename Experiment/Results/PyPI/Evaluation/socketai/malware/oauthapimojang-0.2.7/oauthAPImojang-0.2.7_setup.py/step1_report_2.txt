  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'oauthAPImojang' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setuptools' module import and the 'setup()' function call with package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only declares package configuration and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only specifies static package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The dependencies are common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata, including name, version, packages, and dependencies. All elements are standard for Python packaging. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard package configuration without any suspicious behavior.",
