  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'oauthAPImojang' Python module including its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data: package name, version, package list, required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python module. It defines metadata and dependencies without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or network communication. All dependencies appear typical for cryptography, Windows-specific features, and HTTP requests. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code follows standard packaging conventions and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
