  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day for specific years using recurrence rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from dateutil.rrule and datetime modules; defined constants and test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up a recurrence rule and tests its behavior with predefined date ranges; no flow of untrusted data to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard use of dateutil.rrule for recurrence calculations, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day on the third Monday of January starting from 1986. It then tests this rule against multiple date ranges to verify correct output. The code uses standard library functions without dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. The test cases seem appropriate for verifying the recurrence logic, and no external data or environment variables are used. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for calculating MLK Day dates, with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard recurrence calculations and validations. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
