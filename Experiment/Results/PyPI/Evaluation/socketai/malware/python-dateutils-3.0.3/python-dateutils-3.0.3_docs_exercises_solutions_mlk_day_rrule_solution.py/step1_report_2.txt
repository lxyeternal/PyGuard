{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date(s) of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) for specified date ranges using the dateutil rrule module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input date ranges from the MLK_TEST_CASES list for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally; it only performs in-memory date calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges are used in assertions to verify the correctness of the MLK_DAY recurrence rule; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard library functions and well-known modules for date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day based on a specific pattern using dateutil's rrule. It includes test cases that verify the rule over different date ranges. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on date calculations without external interactions, network access, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign date calculation utility with associated test cases. It demonstrates no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for calculating and testing MLK Day dates.",
