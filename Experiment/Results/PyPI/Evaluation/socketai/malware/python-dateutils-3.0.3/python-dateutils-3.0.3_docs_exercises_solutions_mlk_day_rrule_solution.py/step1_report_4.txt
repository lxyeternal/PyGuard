  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) for given date ranges and test the calculation.",
  "sources": "Reading the start and end dates for test cases from the MLK_TEST_CASES list.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or send untrusted data externally; it only performs date calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges -> MLK_DAY.between() method -> Returns list of dates; no external data flow or output manipulation involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Usage of dateutil's rrule is standard for recurring date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day using dateutil.rrule with specific parameters. It then tests this rule against predefined date ranges with expected results. The code appears to be a straightforward date calculation with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues. No suspicious external communications, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code calculates and tests the MLK Day dates within specified ranges. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The implementation is consistent with normal date handling practices.",
