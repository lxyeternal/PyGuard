  "purpose": "Calculate and test the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day for specific date ranges using the dateutil rrule library.",
  "sources": "Reads predefined constants, date inputs from test cases, and the rrule module's recurrence rule definitions.",
  "sinks": "Uses the rrule.between() method to retrieve dates; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges flow into the rrule.between() calls, which retrieve matching recurrence dates from the MLK_DAY rule.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day using dateutil's rrule module, then tests the rule across several date ranges to verify the correct dates are returned. The logic is based solely on well-known recurrence patterns and test cases. No external data, no suspicious code execution, and no dynamic or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for calculating recurring dates of MLK Day. It includes straightforward test cases that validate the recurrence rule. There is no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks detected.",
