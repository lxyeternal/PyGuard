  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day for specific years using recurrence rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from dateutil.rrule and datetime modules, which are standard libraries for date handling and recurrence rules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input or output sensitive data; the code solely generates date calculations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code generates a static set of recurring dates without data flow from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions for date calculations and contains no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day using dateutil.rrule, specifying the first occurrence and pattern (third Monday in January). It also contains test cases verifying the correctness of these dates over multiple periods. The functions are straightforward, with no external input or potentially malicious logic. The usage of libraries and functions appears normal and intended for date calculations, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard date calculation for MLK Day, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply leverages dateutil.rrule to compute recurring dates and validates them with test cases. No security risks or malware signs are present.",
