{
  "purpose": "Calculate Easter dates using Julian, Orthodox, or Western algorithms based on the input year.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' and 'method'; internal calculations based on established algorithms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; purely computational with no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' -> internal calculations -> date output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-commented, and based on known algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Easter calculation algorithms with proper input validation, using only deterministic mathematical operations and the standard datetime library. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic aligns with reputable sources, and the implementation is transparent and well-structured. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for calculating Easter dates, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern indicators. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
