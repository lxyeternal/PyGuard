{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to calculate Easter date using various calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' for calculating the date; internal constants and calculations based on year value.",
  "sinks": "Returns a datetime.date object representing Easter; no untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' -> Calculation logic -> Return of date object; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual or obfuscated code patterns, no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for different Easter calculation methods and a function 'easter' that computes the date based on the selected method. The calculations involve mathematical operations, modular arithmetic, and date conversions typical of calendar algorithms. No input/output external to the function, no network activity, no file handling, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of established algorithms for calculating Easter, with proper input validation for 'method'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of Easter date calculation algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The logic is consistent with well-known algorithms, and no external or hidden malicious code is detected.",
