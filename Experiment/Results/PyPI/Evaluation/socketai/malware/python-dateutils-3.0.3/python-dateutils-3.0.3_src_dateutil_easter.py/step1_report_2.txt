  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different algorithms and calendar systems.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'year' parameter and 'method' parameter; uses imported 'datetime' module.",
  "sinks": "Returns a datetime.date object representing Easter date; no direct sinks for untrusted data or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' -> calculations involving mathematical operations and conditional logic -> output of datetime.date object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Uses standard Python modules and straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and a function to calculate Easter dates based on different algorithms. It performs standard arithmetic operations and date calculations. No evidence of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. No data leakage or insecure practices identified. Uses standard Python 'datetime' library for date handling. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Easter date calculations with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies solely on standard libraries and algorithms. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
