  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided reports and the code to determine the accuracy of the assessments, the correctness of the scoring, and any potential risks.\n\n1. **Code Verification and Functionality:**\n   - The code calculates Easter dates based on three methods: Julian, Orthodox, and Western.\n   - It uses well-established algorithms and standard Python modules (`datetime`).\n   - The logic appears consistent with known algorithms for Easter calculation.\n   - Input validation for the 'method' parameter is present.\n   - No external data fetching, network communication, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code is deterministic and straightforward.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Content:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and based on well-documented algorithms.\n   - No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - The analysis correctly notes the absence of obfuscation, external data, or malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as the code performs only date calculations without external interactions or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.\n   - The algorithms are standard and well-understood.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - The code is safe, transparent, and does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n  *No malicious activity detected.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n  *Code is clear and straightforward.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0.0  \n  *No security risks identified.*\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-implemented utility for calculating Easter dates using established algorithms. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe existing reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
