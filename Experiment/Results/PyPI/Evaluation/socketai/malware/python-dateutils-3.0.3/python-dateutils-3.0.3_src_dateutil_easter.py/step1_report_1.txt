  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input: 'year' parameter; Data from the 'datetime' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks data; no output to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' flows through calculations of date components; final date returned as 'datetime.date' object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code primarily performs date calculations. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or misleading code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and a function for calculating Easter based on different algorithms. It uses input validation for method parameter. The logic is based solely on deterministic astronomical calculations without external data fetching, network communication, or system manipulation. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The use of standard libraries (datetime) and straightforward mathematical operations indicates benign behavior. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate astronomical date calculations for Easter and does not exhibit any malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. It is a benign, well-structured utility for date computation.",
