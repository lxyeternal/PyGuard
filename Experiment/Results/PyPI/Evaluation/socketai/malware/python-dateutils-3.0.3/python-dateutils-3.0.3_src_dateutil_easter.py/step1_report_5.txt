{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using various algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Reads the input parameter 'year' and optional 'method'. Uses built-in 'datetime' library for date creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful manner; the code simply computes and returns a date.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' flows through calculations to determine the Easter date, which is then returned as a datetime.date object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No unusual or misleading code structures. The code performs mathematical calculations based on standard algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented Easter calculation algorithms, with clear constants and comments. It accepts a year and an optional method parameter, validates the method, and performs calculations accordingly. It uses standard Python arithmetic and the datetime module to generate the date. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy leaks are present. The logic is straightforward and based on known algorithms, with no hidden code or external data fetching.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of Easter date calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains no malware or security risks beyond normal computational logic.",
