{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'year' and 'method'. Uses standard Python 'datetime' module for date creation.",
  "sinks": "None. No untrusted data output or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' are used internally to compute date; no external flows or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The calculations are straightforward date computations based on well-documented algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for different Easter calculation methods and computes the date based on classical astronomical algorithms. It uses simple arithmetic and modular operations without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data. It relies solely on standard library functions, with no network calls or data exfiltration. The logic appears to implement known formulas from reputable sources, with clear input validation. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate astronomical calculations for Easter dates using well-documented algorithms. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a straightforward utility function with no security risks or malicious features.",
