{
  "purpose": "Generate metadata JSON file containing information and SHA-512 hash of a specified tzdata tarball.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments ('tzdata', 'version', optional 'out' filename), file read operation in 'calculate_sha512' function.",
  "sinks": "Writing the formatted JSON metadata to a file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> calculate_sha512 reads file -> format metadata string -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward use of hashlib for hashing, standard file operations, and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a filename and version as input, computes the SHA-512 hash of the specified file, formats a metadata JSON with this data, and writes it to an output file. The process is standard, with no code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any external data transmission, system modifications, or contain hardcoded secrets. The use of hashlib is appropriate, and the script's operations are predictable and controlled. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed to generate metadata with a hash of a given file. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code. It is safe for use in a supply chain context.",
