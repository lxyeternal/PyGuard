  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured date utility with no malicious or security-threatening features. It aligns with known date manipulation libraries and does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to benign warnings about non-integer absolute date inputs. Overall, it is safe for supply chain deployment."
