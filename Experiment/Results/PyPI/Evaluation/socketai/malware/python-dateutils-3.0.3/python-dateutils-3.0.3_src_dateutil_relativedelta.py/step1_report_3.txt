{
  "purpose": "Define a 'relativedelta' class for manipulating date and time differences, including relative and absolute modifications to datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (datetime, calendar, operator, math, warnings, six, and a local '_common' module), and class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Methods performing date calculations and adjustments, such as __add__, __sub__, __radd__, __rsub__, and __mul__, which modify datetime objects based on relativedelta instances.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, relativedelta instances, numeric parameters) is processed in the constructor, then manipulated via methods to adjust or compare datetime objects, with possible data flow from constructor inputs to date modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activities. Use of warnings for non-integer absolute values is benign. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive relativedelta class for date arithmetic, closely following standard date manipulation logic. It includes methods for addition, subtraction, normalization, and comparison of date deltas. The constructor handles both relative and absolute date modifications, with input validation and adjustments. All code appears to serve legitimate date handling purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of standard libraries and clear structure further reduces suspicion. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. Overall, the code's functionality aligns with expected date manipulation and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a 'relativedelta' class for date arithmetic, with no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs legitimate date calculations and adjustments, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
