{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class 'relativedelta' for manipulating date and time intervals, including relative and absolute adjustments to datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as dt1, dt2, and various keyword arguments (years, months, days, etc.). It also reads from imported modules and attributes, including datetime, calendar, operator, and weekday.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include the addition and subtraction methods (__add__, __sub__), which perform date arithmetic; and the property and method that generate date adjustments. No unsafe data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes; then, through methods like __add__, __sub__, and __radd__, data influences date calculations and object state updates. These operations are standard date manipulations; no untrusted external data flows to external systems are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are evident. The code uses warnings for deprecated float usage in absolute date arguments, but this is benign. No suspicious dynamic execution or external resource access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured class for date interval manipulation, implementing methods for arithmetic operations, normalization, comparison, and representation. It handles complex date calculations and edge cases such as leap years and week-based adjustments. It does not contain network calls, file access, or dynamic code execution. All imported modules and functions are standard or local. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The only minor concern is the use of a warning for non-integer absolute date inputs, which does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of date interval management with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It serves a legitimate purpose for date arithmetic and has no evident security risks or malware vectors.",
