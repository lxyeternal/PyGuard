{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'relativedelta' class for manipulating date and time intervals, allowing complex relative date calculations, such as adding months, weeks, or specific weekdays to datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (datetime, calendar, operator, math, six, warnings), and the local module '._common' for weekday definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods that perform date calculations and modifications, especially '__add__', '__sub__', and '__radd__', which modify datetime objects; no data sinks involve untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects or date components flow into relativedelta instances; the operations (__add__, __sub__) modify datetime objects based on the relativedelta's attributes; no external or untrusted data is fed into these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as network activity, file access, or credential handling is present. The code solely performs date calculations and object manipulations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The use of warnings for deprecation notices is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a date/time manipulation class, with comprehensive methods for arithmetic operations, normalization, and comparison. It imports only benign modules and performs expected date arithmetic without obfuscated or malicious constructs. No functions or logic indicate data exfiltration, network communication, or stealthy behavior. The presence of detailed date handling logic appears legitimate and consistent with common date utility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate date manipulation utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains no network, file, or environment variable access, and no suspicious obfuscated logic. The purpose is to perform date calculations; all components are standard and benign.",
