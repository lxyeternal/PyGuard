{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a relativedelta class for manipulating date and time differences, with support for relative and absolute date adjustments.",
  "sources": "Imports datetime, calendar, operator, math, six, and a local '_common' module; reads input from function arguments, class attributes, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; code performs calculations and manipulations on date/datetime objects and attributes, but does not interact with external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (dates, date components, weekday) -> internal calculations and adjustments -> output as modified datetime or relativedelta object.",
  "anomalies": "None evident. The code is a standard implementation of date manipulation logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'relativedelta' class for date/time arithmetic, including various constructors, operator overloads, and helper functions. It performs date calculations based on inputs, with no evidence of malicious behavior or external communication. The code handles date adjustments, normalizations, and comparisons securely and without external dependencies that could be exploited. No unusual code constructs, backdoors, data leaks, or network interactions are present. The use of standard modules and straightforward logic reduces suspicion. The code appears consistent with an open-source date utility library, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, open-source utility for date manipulation without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears safe and well-structured, serving its intended purpose without security risks.",
