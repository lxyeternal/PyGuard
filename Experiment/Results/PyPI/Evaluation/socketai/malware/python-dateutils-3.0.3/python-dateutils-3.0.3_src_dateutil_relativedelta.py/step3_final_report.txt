  "purpose": "A date utility class for manipulating datetime objects via relative and absolute adjustments, supporting operations like addition, subtraction, normalization, and comparison.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for constructor (dt1, dt2, keyword arguments), and internal methods accessing date/datetime attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor inputs (absolute or relative date components) flow into internal attribute assignments; operator overloads create date adjustments via internal calculations; normalization and comparison methods process internal state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings for non-integer absolute date inputs; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard 'relativedelta' class for date arithmetic, handling relative and absolute date modifications, leap years, normalization, and comparison. It relies solely on standard libraries and a local '_common' module for weekdays. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. Input validation warnings are benign. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of edge cases. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured date utility with no malicious or security-threatening features. It aligns with known date manipulation libraries and does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to benign warnings about non-integer absolute date inputs. Overall, it is safe for supply chain deployment.",
