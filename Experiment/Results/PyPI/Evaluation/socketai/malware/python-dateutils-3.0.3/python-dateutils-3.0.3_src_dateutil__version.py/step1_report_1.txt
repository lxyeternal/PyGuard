  "purpose": "Setuptools version metadata assignment for package versioning",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assignment (__version__ and version variables)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, static assignment without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating the file is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked in version control",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static version information to module variables. It includes a comment noting it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm. There are no external input reads, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The structure is straightforward and typical for version metadata files, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security issues.",
