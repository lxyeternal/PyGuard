  "purpose": "To define versioning information for a Python package, indicating the package version and version tuple.",
  "sources": "The assignment of version string and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Assignment from static string to variables; no flow of untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, static, and does not perform any dynamic or suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables with static values, indicating the package's version. The comments specify it's generated by setuptools_scm, a common version management tool. There are no inputs, no data flows, and no code that could be malicious. The content is typical for version metadata in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version indicator with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
