  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The assignment of version string and tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of auto-generated comment indicating automated versioning; no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only assigns version information variables with static data. It includes no input reading, network access, or data manipulation. No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or malicious patterns are present. The comment suggests this file is auto-generated and intended for version tracking, not execution of malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version info file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
