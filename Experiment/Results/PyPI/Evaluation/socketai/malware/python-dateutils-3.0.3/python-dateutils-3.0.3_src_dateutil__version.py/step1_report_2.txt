  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; simple variable assignments only",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates auto-generation and a restriction on modifications, no malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static version strings and tuples, with comments stating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm. There are no dynamic or external data inputs, no functions, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The code serves solely to hold version metadata, which is common and benign in package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign version declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
