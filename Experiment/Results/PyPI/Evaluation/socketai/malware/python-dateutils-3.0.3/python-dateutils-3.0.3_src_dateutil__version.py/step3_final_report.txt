  "purpose": "Static assignment of version metadata variables generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code; static string and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of static assignments without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with clear comments indicating its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static set of variable assignments for version information, with comments indicating auto-generation. There are no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is typical for version metadata files in Python packages, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
