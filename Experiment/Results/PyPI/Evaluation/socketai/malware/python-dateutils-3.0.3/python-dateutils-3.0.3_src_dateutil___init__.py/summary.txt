  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity pointing to malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1) are justified and consistent with the evidence. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
