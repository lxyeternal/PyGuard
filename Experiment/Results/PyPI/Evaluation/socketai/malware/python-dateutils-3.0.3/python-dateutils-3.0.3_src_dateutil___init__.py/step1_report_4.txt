    "Obfuscated string 'trust' contains base64-encoded data that is decoded and evaluated",
    "Potentially malicious dynamic code execution that is hidden behind obfuscation",
    "Network request URL embedded in code suggests possible command and control activity"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script starts with importing standard modules, then defines several variables with obfuscated or encoded strings, which are subsequently decoded and evaluated dynamically. The use of eval() on such data strongly indicates obfuscation to hide malicious intent. The code constructs a URL targeting a suspicious domain and performs network operations, potentially exfiltrating data or executing remote commands. The embedded base64-encoded payload, when decoded and executed, could perform malicious activities such as data theft, unauthorized access, or persistence. The obfuscation techniques and dynamic code execution pose significant security concerns, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, use of eval() on encoded data, and network requests to suspicious domains. It likely performs malicious activities such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or maintaining persistence. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous.",
