      "conclusion": "The setup script executes an arbitrary module during installation, which is a significant supply chain security concern. The suspicious package metadata supports the risk assessment. The behavior could lead to malicious code execution, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The overall risk is high, and the package should be reviewed or avoided until the behavior is clarified or mitigated."

      "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious, espionage-capable RAT with extensive data theft, system sabotage, and remote control functionalities. It contains hardcoded credentials, destructive commands, and routines for exfiltrating sensitive data, confirming its malicious nature with high confidence. It warrants immediate classification as severe malware."
