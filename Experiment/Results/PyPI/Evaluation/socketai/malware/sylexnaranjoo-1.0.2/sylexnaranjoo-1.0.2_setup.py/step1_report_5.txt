The author email is generic, and the overall intent is obscure.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The setup script imports 'setuptools' and defines a custom install command that executes a subprocess. The subprocess runs 'python -m syntax', which is suspicious because 'syntax' is not a standard Python module and could be a placeholder or malicious payload. The package metadata includes strange descriptions and minimal security-related context. The dependencies listed are common but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The code structure itself is typical for a setup script, but the post-install command introduces a significant risk if 'syntax' executes malicious code or performs harmful actions during installation.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The script contains a potentially malicious post-install step that executes an unspecified module 'syntax', which could be malicious. The overall setup appears suspicious due to the unclear purpose and strange module invocation. Caution is advised before using this package.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.6,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.65\n}",
