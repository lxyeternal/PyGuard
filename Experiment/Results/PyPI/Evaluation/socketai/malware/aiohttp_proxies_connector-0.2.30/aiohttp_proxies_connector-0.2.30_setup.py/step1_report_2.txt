{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package and then dynamically generates and executes obfuscated Python code, possibly to load and run additional code or scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (USERPROFILE), reads from __init__.py for version, reads README.md for description, reads environment variables, and reads base64-encoded strings which are decoded into Python code.",
  "sinks": "Executes dynamically generated Python code via run() function, potentially running decoded code with subprocess and dynamic execution. Also writes to files and creates directories, which could be used for persistence or data collection.",
  "flows": "Source environment variables and file reads → decoding base64 strings to Python code → dynamically executing or running the decoded code via subprocess → writing logs and files as side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of base64-encoded, decoded code, which is written to files and executed. The code contains obfuscated and complex base64-encoded payloads, likely indicating an attempt to hide malicious or unwanted behavior. It also accesses environment variables and creates files in temporary directories without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up package metadata and dependencies, then proceeds to decode multiple base64 strings into Python scripts. These scripts include functions for managing tokens, credentials, and executing other scripts or commands. The base64 payloads decoded contain code that interacts with system environment variables, writes files, and executes external commands. The use of obfuscated code and dynamic execution strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity, such as downloading or executing further malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The script’s structure and payloads resemble typical malicious supply chain tactics—hidden code, base64 obfuscation, and dynamic execution—raising high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains heavily obfuscated base64 payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically, with no clear benign purpose. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the ability to execute arbitrary code and manipulate system environment and files, indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior. It appears designed to conceal its true intent and potentially perform harmful actions on the host system.",
