  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input processing occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "This code solely consists of class definitions for custom exception handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions. It appears to be standard, boilerplate exception class declarations with inheritance from built-in exceptions. No indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The classes serve to categorize errors and are common in network proxy implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is likely part of a larger application handling SOCKS proxy operations. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk detected.",
