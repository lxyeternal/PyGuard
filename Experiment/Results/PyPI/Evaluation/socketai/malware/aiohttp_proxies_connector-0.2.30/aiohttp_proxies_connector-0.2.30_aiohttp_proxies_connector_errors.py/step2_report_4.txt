  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malicious intent are identified.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inherit from standard exceptions, and are named appropriately.\n\n**Confirmations and discrepancies:**\n- The original code matches the descriptions in all reports: simple, static class definitions with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no external inputs/outputs, and no signs of malware or security risks.\n- The code is consistent with typical error handling structures in Python.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is accurate.\n- Security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting high certainty based on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough; no issues or inaccuracies are apparent.\n- The risk scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- No need to adjust scores or challenge assumptions, as all evidence points to the code being benign.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Confirm the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Maintain high confidence in the benign nature of this code segment.\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's safety and correctness in its context.",
