  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard exception types such as Exception and OSError. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The classes serve as specific error types for SOCKS proxy and connection error handling, indicating expected use in a larger application context. The code is clear, simple, and standard for error handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
