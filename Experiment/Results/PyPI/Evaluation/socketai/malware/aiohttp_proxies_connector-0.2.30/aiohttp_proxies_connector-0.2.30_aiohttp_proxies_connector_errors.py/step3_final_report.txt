  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no input, data, or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class hierarchy with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy error exceptions, inheriting from base exception classes. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is static, simple, and standard. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The structure and naming are appropriate, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and appropriate.",
