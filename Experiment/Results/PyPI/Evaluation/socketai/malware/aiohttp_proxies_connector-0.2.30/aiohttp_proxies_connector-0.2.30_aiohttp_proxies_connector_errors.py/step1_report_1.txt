  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all classes are definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no execution flows or data flows involving untrusted data or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected. The code consists solely of exception class definitions with inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The class hierarchy appears straightforward and conventional, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or external dependencies indicates this code is purely structural, aimed at error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, simple, and focused on exception hierarchy.",
