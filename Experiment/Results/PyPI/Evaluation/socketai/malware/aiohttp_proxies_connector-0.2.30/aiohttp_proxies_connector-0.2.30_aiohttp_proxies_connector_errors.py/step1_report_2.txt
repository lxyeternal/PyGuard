  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only exception class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious logic. The classes are named appropriately for SOCKS proxy error handling, and there are no signs of malicious code or behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger module that handles SOCKS proxy errors, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines custom exception classes for SOCKS-related errors. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
