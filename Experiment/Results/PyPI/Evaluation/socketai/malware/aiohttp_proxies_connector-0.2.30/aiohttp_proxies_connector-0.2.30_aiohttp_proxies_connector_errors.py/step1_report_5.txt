  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are used for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from base exceptions such as Exception, SocksError, and OSError. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution mechanisms. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The structure appears straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger codebase focused on error handling related to SOCKS proxies.",
