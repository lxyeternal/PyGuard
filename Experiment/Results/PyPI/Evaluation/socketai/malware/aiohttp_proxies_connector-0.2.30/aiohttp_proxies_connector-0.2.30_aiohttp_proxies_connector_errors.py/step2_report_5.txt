  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - All reports describe the code as purely defining exception classes with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: only class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions are present.\n   - No signs of code execution, data processing, or network operations are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or mistakes are apparent.\n   - The class hierarchy and naming conventions are appropriate for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The high confidence (1) across reports is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They recognize the code as standard exception definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Remarks**:\n- The code appears benign and well-structured.\n- It is likely part of a larger, secure application handling SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on this review.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
