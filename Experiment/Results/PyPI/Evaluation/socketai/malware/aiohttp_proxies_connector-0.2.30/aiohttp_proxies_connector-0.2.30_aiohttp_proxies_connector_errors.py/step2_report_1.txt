  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity or code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated class definitions.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the fact that these are just exception class definitions with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely definitional and contains no executable or network activity, there is no basis for a higher risk score. The risk is minimal, and the current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's structure and purpose. No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the current scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**No changes needed.**",
