  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Score Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is purely structural and contains no vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Risk Scores (above 0.5):**  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no concern about underestimating risk. The code's nature does not justify higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly focusing on the code's structure and purpose.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the code's simplicity and purpose, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, well-structured, and safe. It serves as part of an error handling framework within a larger SOCKS proxy implementation. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code.",
