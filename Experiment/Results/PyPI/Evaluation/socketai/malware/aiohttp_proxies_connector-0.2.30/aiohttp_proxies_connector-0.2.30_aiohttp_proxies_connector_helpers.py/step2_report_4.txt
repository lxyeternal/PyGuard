  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and opens network connections asynchronously.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are evident.\n- Usage of standard libraries and well-understood patterns.\n- External proxies could be malicious, but the code itself is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate, describes the flow from URL parsing to socket connection.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as a legitimate network utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is justified given the code's utility nature. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that the code manages proxy connections without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard for proxy connections.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a standard proxy utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Valid reasoning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is a straightforward utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is functional, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as expected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose, the low risk score (~0.2) is justified. The main concern is reliance on external proxies, which could be malicious, but that is outside the code itself.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (external proxies could be malicious, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy connection utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain issues.",
