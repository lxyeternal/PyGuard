  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a network utility module that creates SOCKS proxy sockets and establishes connections asynchronously.\n- It parses proxy URLs, manages connection parameters, and creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4/5.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The functions rely on external inputs (proxy URLs, host, port), which could be malicious if the proxies are compromised, but the code itself is standard.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports indicate no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code functions as intended for proxy connection management.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and lacks malicious intent. They also correctly note that the use of external proxies could be a security concern if those proxies are malicious, but this is an external trust issue, not a code flaw.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  The malware scores are 0, which is reasonable given the analysis. The security risk scores are 0.2, reflecting some concern over external proxies, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Is the risk score higher than 0.5 justified?**  \n  No. The risk scores are all 0.2, which is reasonable given the external proxy dependency.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified since there's no malicious behavior or code.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code itself is benign but note external trust dependencies.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (some external trust dependency, but no direct vulnerability)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (due to reliance on external proxies, which could be malicious but is outside the code's control)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections. No malicious or supply chain issues are evident. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, as they accurately reflect the analysis.
