  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the descriptions provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4/5, and opens network connections.\n- The code relies on user-provided parameters and external proxy servers.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are evident.\n- The functions include proper input validation and exception handling.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or covert channels are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functional.\n- **Security concerns:** The code does not contain any embedded malicious behavior.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The main risk is reliance on external proxies, which could be malicious, but this is external to the code logic itself.\n- **Input validation:** Proper validation for host, port, and proxy URL parsing.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code itself is a legitimate network utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate network utility, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable given the context.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard implementation, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the trust dependency on external proxies, but no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connection utility, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Straightforward SOCKS proxy connection setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and no malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the external dependency on potentially malicious proxies but not the code itself.\n\n**However,** considering the importance of supply chain security, I would suggest that the risk score could be lowered further to **0.1**, since the code is standard, and the only external risk stems from the proxies used, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal inherent risk, primarily due to external proxy trust assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate network utility with no signs of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, but I recommend slightly lowering the overall risk score to 0.1 to reflect the code's benign nature more accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Adjust risk score to **0.1** for a more precise assessment.",
