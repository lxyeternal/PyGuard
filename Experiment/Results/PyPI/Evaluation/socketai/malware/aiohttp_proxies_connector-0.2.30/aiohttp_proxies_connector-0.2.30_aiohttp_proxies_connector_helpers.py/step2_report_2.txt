  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a network utility for SOCKS proxy connections, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable, given the use of external proxies which could be malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy connection management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering external proxies.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is thorough and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the same core functionality, with emphasis on external proxy trust.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard proxy connection utility, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected, scores are consistent.\n- **Security risk:** The main concern is reliance on external proxies, which could be malicious if used maliciously, but the code itself is benign. A risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no hidden or malicious code is present.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to external proxy trust assumptions, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. No changes needed. The code is a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.",
