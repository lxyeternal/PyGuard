  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL components (scheme, host, port, user, password), input parameters (host, port, proxy URL)",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details -> create_socket_wrapper creates socket -> open_connection/create_connection use socket to connect to target host",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It performs input validation, URL parsing, and socket creation without any malicious logic. No obfuscation or covert channels are present. External proxies could be malicious, but this is an external trust issue, not a code flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting external proxy trust dependency.",
