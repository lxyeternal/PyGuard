  "purpose": "This code module appears to be part of a SOCKS proxy client library, providing connectors, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, and __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications directly in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; this code mainly defines imports and exports, no data flow occurs here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, defining imports and exports without suspicious logic or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, sets a version string, and defines what symbols are publicly available via __all__. It does not include dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. All components appear to be standard for a library that manages proxy connections. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It mainly manages module imports, versioning, and public API declarations.",
