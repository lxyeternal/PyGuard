  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that:\n- Imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string.\n- Declares the `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n\n**Security Implications:**\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs in this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n- All reports consistently identify this as a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. They assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores & Reasoning:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified by the lack of suspicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n  - **Security risk:** 0 or negligible (some reports mention a very low risk, e.g., 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n  - The code relies on other modules (.connector, .errors, etc.) which are not shown here. If those modules contain malicious code, it could change the risk profile. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n  - The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent without evidence.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Based on this fragment alone, I agree with the provided scores.\n- If future analysis includes the referenced modules, a review of their content would be prudent.\n- No evidence suggests any malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk in this code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering minimal risk from dependencies)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or security concerns evident from the provided snippet.",
