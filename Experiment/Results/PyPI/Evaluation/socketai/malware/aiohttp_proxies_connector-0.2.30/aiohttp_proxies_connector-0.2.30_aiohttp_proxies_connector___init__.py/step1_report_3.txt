{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a library that implements a proxy connection framework, handling SOCKS proxy communication and connection management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative files: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it mainly imports classes and functions, no data processing or output points identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports, with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets module-level metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports various components necessary for proxy connection functionality. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure suggests a straightforward library module setup with no apparent security risks or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module initialization and import script for a proxy connection library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
