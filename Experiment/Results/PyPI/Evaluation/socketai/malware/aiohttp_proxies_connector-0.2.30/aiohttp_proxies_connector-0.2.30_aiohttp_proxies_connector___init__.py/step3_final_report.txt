  "purpose": "Module setup for SOCKS proxy components, importing classes, functions, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import statements and export definitions; no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization file, importing necessary components and defining the public API. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and negligible security risks. The only minor inconsistency is a report assigning a small security risk (0.1) despite the absence of vulnerabilities; this should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, with a slight correction to the security risk score in one report. Overall, it is safe for use.",
