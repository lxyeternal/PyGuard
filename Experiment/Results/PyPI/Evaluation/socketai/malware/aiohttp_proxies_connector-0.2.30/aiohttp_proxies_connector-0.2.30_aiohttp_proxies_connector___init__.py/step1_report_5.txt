{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and export classes, errors, helpers, and constants related to a proxy connection system, likely used for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto.",
  "sinks": "Exports of classes, error types, functions, and constants that could be used in proxy connection handling.",
  "flows": "External code imports the module, then uses exported components to establish and manage proxy connections, with data flow involving proxy configuration and connection procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; all imports and exports are standard for a proxy handling library. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines a version and __all__ list for exports. It does not contain executable logic or data processing; instead, it sets up the interface for proxy connection management. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The focus appears to be on modular, maintainable code design for proxy handling.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard component of a proxy connection library, exporting classes, error types, and helpers. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident from this code. It is safe and intended for managing SOCKS proxy connections.",
