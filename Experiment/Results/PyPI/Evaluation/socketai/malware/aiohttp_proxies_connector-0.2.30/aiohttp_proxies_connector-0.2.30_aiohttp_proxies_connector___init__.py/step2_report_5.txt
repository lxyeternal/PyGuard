  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their conclusions, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module setup: imports, version string, and exports via `__all__`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Module setup for SOCKS proxy components.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies this as a benign setup module with no malicious or obfuscated code. The malware score is appropriate. The confidence is high, given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Part of SOCKS proxy client library.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's nature. No issues detected. The malware score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection framework.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly elevated given the code's benign nature. Since this code only imports and exports modules, there's no apparent security concern. The score could be lowered to 0, aligning with the rest.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy handling package setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with others; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection interface setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues; the report correctly states the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify this code as a benign, standard module setup.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The only minor inconsistency is Report 3's security risk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as no security concerns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThis code is purely structural, defining module exports and importing components. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with a minor note to align the security risk score in Report 3 to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0**.  \n- Confirm that the code is benign and suitable for production use as part of a SOCKS proxy library.",
