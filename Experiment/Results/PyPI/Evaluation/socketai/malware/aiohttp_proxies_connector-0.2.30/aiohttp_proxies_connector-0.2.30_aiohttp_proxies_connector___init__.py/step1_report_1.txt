{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports various components related to a SOCKS proxy implementation, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) which likely contain additional code and data. No external input sources are evident in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "None directly observable; the code mainly sets up exports and imports functions and classes without executing external commands or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet; the code only imports and exports components, not processing any data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present in this fragment. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining a version string, and an __all__ list for module exports. It references other modules which may contain implementation details, but within this fragment, there is no suspicious or malicious logic. No input/output handling, network activity, or data manipulation occurs here. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard setup for a Python module related to SOCKS proxy functionality. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports, defines, and exports components. The overall security risk is minimal.",
