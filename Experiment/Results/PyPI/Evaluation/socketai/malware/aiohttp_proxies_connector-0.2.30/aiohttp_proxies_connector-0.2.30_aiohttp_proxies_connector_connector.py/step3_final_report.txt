  "purpose": "Implementation of a customizable aiohttp proxy connector supporting proxy URL parsing, socket wrapping, and optional DNS resolution bypass.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parameters, external helper functions (`parse_proxy_url`, `create_socket_wrapper`), and class properties.",
  "sinks": "Socket creation via `create_socket_wrapper`, proxy URL construction, network connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parameters -> `proxy_url` property -> `_wrap_create_connection` method -> socket connection or proxy request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; reliance on external helper functions whose implementations are unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector with configurable proxy settings and optional DNS resolution bypass. It uses external helper functions presumed to be safe. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only external concern is the `create_socket_wrapper` function, which could be malicious if implemented improperly, but no evidence suggests this here. The code handles credentials securely and constructs proxy URLs dynamically. The security risk is low, and malware presence is unlikely. The overall design is straightforward and aligns with common proxy handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score assigned in the reports is appropriate. The main external dependency (`create_socket_wrapper`) should be verified for safety, but based on the provided information, the code is considered safe.",
