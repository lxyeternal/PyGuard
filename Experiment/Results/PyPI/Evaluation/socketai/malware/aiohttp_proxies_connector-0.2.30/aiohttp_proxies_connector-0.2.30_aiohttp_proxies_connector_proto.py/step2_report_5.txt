  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain issues are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The low malware score aligns with the review. The security risk is minimal, considering proxy handling code generally doesn't introduce high risk unless misused.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms a standard implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous assessment; no suspicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower security risk score, which is reasonable given the absence of any concerning patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The scores are consistent with the code's description.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: legitimate SOCKS proxy client code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content—no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk in proxy code but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients using asyncio.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The network operations are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Proxy code always carries some risk, but in this case, it's minimal and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
