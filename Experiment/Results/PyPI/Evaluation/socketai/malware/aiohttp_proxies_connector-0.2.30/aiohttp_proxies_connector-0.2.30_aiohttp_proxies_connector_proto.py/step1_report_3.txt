{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate proxy connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads include hostnames/IP addresses, ports, and potentially user credentials (if set). Data is read during socket connection, address resolution, authentication, and proxy response handling.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure data handling occurs during socket operations, especially in connect, negotiate, and address parsing functions. There are no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks beyond standard socket communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, user credentials) flows into socket connection and proxy negotiation functions. Data received from proxy responses flows into error handling and address parsing. No flows show untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret data. No suspicious hardcoded IPs or domains. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Exception handling is standard; no suspicious fallback behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous socket communication. It includes address resolution, socket connection, SOCKS handshake, authentication, and response parsing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Error handling appears consistent and does not leak sensitive info or perform harmful actions. The code structure and logic follow expected patterns for proxy communication. No malicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asyncio. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a typical, well-structured proxy client code without security risks in the examined scope.",
