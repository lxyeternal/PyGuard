  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio for asynchronous network communication.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, destination address resolution, and authentication credentials (for SOCKS5).",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations that send and receive data, including connection establishment and data transmission to proxy and destination servers.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> address resolution -> proxy connection -> SOCKS negotiation (authentication and connect) -> data transmission between client and destination.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network behaviors detected. Code is straightforward and adheres to standard protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It performs address resolution, handles authentication, and manages network connections with proper error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The security risk stems from network operations involving untrusted data, but this is inherent to proxy functionality and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent across multiple reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and align with the code's structure and purpose. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
