  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard async SOCKS4/5 proxy client wrapper with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The reviewer assigns a very low malware score (0) and a modest security risk (0.2). Given the code's straightforward implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and adherence to protocol standards, these scores seem appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** No issues detected. The logic is sound, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the first report, the scores seem appropriate. The code's behavior is standard, and no malicious indicators are present.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower security risk score, reflecting confidence in code integrity. The malware score remains zero.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The code appears legitimate, with no hidden malicious features.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious indicators.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's transparency and lack of malicious features.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in proxy code, especially when implemented correctly.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard network operations, with proper error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.\n- The consistent low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal inherent risk, mainly from proxy operation, which is common and expected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and justified based on the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
