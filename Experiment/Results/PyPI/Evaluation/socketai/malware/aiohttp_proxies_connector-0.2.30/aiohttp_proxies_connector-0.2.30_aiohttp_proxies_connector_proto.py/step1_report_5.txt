{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous network communication, facilitating connections through proxy servers with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user-provided hostnames, ports, optional user credentials, and DNS resolution results. Data is read from network responses and internal functions handling socket communication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into socket communication functions, especially in sending connection requests and authentication data. Data received from proxies is processed and may lead to address resolution or be used in establishing connections.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and credentials are used to build requests sent to proxy servers. Responses from proxy servers are parsed and checked for errors. Resolved addresses are then used to establish destination connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; the code adheres to standard proxy protocol implementations. No suspicious code behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoor activities are evident. The code properly handles exceptions and cleans up socket resources. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy client logic with asyncio support, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It properly manages socket resources, handles errors, and follows protocol specifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as secret exfiltration, reverse shells, or covert channels. It uses publicly documented protocols and standard libraries without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients for asynchronous Python applications. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors, and it follows expected protocol operations. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the input data and external proxy servers.",
