{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for establishing network connections through proxies, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hostnames and ports from user input (instance variables), and network address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets, including proxy negotiation data and potentially untrusted address information. Functions like sock_sendall and sock_recv are sinks where untrusted data could influence network behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication processes; then proxy negotiation data flows from code to network sockets; finally, the socket connection is established through the proxy server, relaying data between local and remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious obfuscated code. The code handles network operations securely with error checking. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors is present. It uses standard Python libraries and methods for network communication and address resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers using asyncio, with functions to resolve addresses, authenticate, and establish connections. It performs appropriate error handling and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious activity. It relies on standard socket operations and asyncio event loop integrations. Overall, it appears to be legitimate, intended for proxy connection management, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asynchronous network connections. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity suggests it is safe for use. Overall security risk and malware likelihood are very low.",
