  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is standard, well-structured, and uses common libraries and protocols.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent; low security risk primarily due to network operations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard implementation without malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; standard proxy client code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — very low, fitting the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; minimal security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — aligned with previous reports.\n- **Justification:** No malicious signals, standard protocol adherence.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—legitimate, standard implementation with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical network code risk, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients using asyncio.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The detailed reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's structure and purpose.\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, inherent to network code, but no specific threats)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent.",
