{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from network socket (sock_recv, sock_sendall), and configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and address resolution results.",
  "sinks": "Network socket communication (sending and receiving data), and address resolution methods that handle potentially untrusted hostnames.",
  "flows": "Data flows from host inputs (hostnames, credentials) to network sockets through connection and negotiation procedures; untrusted data (hostnames) can be resolved locally or remotely, then transmitted over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard proxy negotiation and address resolution procedures. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typical implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with support for authentication, address resolution, and connection handling in an async context. It employs standard socket operations and protocol logic. No hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious behaviors are present. Error handling is consistent with expected network communication patterns. The code appears to be a legitimate proxy client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It is designed for legitimate proxy communication tasks. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
