{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be obfuscated Python script likely designed to execute hidden or malicious operations after decoding and deobfuscating data. It likely aims to run hidden payloads or execute malicious code concealed through multiple layers of encoding and decoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64 and hex-encoded strings embedded within the script, and decodes them dynamically. It also takes input through decode and eval functions, which process obfuscated strings that could originate from external or embedded sources.",
  "sinks": "The decoded data is passed to the eval function, which executes the resulting code, and also to functions like __import__ and decode, which could be used to dynamically load or execute code. This is a classic malicious pattern to execute hidden or obfuscated payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources include base64 and hex-encoded strings that are decoded step-by-step, ultimately feeding into eval and import functions. The flow involves decoding strings multiple times, then executing the decoded code via eval, potentially executing malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive obfuscation using eval, multiple layers of base64 and hex decoding, and dynamic imports indicate malicious intent. The code structure is intentionally convoluted to hide operations. Use of eval with decoded strings is a high-risk indicator. No clear purpose other than executing obfuscated code, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with eval and multiple nested decoding functions, processing strings encoded in hex and base64, which are heavily obfuscated to conceal the true payload. The string data is decoded repeatedly, then executed dynamically via eval. The pattern is typical of malicious scripts that hide their true purpose through obfuscation. The final step is executing the decoded code with eval, which can run arbitrary and potentially harmful code, such as backdoors, system commands, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, layered decoding, and use of eval for execution. These are classic signs of malicious code designed to hide its true functionality. Without the deobfuscated payload, certainty is limited, but the structure and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent.",
