{
  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up and distributing a Python package named 'fast_httpx'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' list and package metadata such as name, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies listed could be used to perform network operations or access browser cookies, but there are no explicit sinks for untrusted data within this setup script itself.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration specifies dependencies that will be installed with the package, which may be used later in the package code to perform network or cookie operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package installation, defining dependencies and metadata. No code execution, input reading, or untrusted data processing occurs here. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. None of these by themselves indicate malicious intent within this setup script. The absence of author details is noteworthy but not inherently malicious. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup.\n\nNo suspicious activities such as data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious; it solely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or obfuscation. The dependencies suggest potential use for network and web-related functionalities, but there is no evidence of malicious intent in this code alone.",
