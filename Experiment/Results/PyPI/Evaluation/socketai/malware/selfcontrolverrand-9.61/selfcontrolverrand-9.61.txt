      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern of executing an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during setup, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The package setup appears benign, but the hidden payload execution warrants serious concern. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is substantial. Decoding the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
