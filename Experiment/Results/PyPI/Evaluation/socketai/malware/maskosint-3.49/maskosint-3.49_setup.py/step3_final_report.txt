  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for directory 'tahg' and the subprocess call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could lead to payload download, remote code execution, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, runs obfuscated PowerShell via subprocess -> command executes silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed with hidden window flags and broad exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally executes an encoded PowerShell payload silently, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The broad try-except blocks mask errors, further concealing potential failures or malicious activity. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload is suspicious. Based on the encoded command's obfuscation, silent execution, and typical malware patterns, the behavior indicates high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, a red flag for malicious activity. While the payload is not decoded, the pattern aligns with malware delivery tactics. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding confirms safety.",
