      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, a red flag for malicious activity. While the payload is not decoded, the pattern aligns with malware delivery tactics. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding confirms safety."
