      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, indicative of malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation and silent execution techniques support this assessment. All reports correctly identify these issues and assign appropriate high scores. The package should be treated as malicious or dangerous until further decoding of the payload confirms benign intent."
