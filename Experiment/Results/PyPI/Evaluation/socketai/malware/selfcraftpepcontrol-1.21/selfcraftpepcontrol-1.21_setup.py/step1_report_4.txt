{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'selfcraftpepcontrol' with potential embedded malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of 'tahg' directory; importing modules; code execution via subprocess.Popen with encoded command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution that runs encoded PowerShell commands, potentially malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> if not, execute PowerShell command -> proceed with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed without validation, likely obfuscated. The code attempts to run external commands hidden from the user interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' to define a package. It conditionally runs an encoded PowerShell command if 'tahg' does not exist, which is suspicious. The command is encoded in base64 and executed via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, indicating an attempt to conceal activity. The command appears to download or run external code from a suspicious domain ('esquelesquad.rip'), which could be malicious. The setup process itself appears normal, but the embedded code execution poses a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that likely downloads or executes malicious code, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The setup process is used as a cover for malicious payload execution.",
