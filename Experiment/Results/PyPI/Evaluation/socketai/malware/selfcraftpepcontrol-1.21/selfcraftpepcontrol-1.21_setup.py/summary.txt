  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscated PowerShell execution, external domain references, and silent error handling. The behavior aligns with known malicious tactics, warranting a high security risk assessment. The scores provided are appropriate; further payload analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
