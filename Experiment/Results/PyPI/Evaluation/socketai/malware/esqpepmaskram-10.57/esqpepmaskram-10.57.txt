      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-severity malicious payload embedded within a legitimate setup script. The execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command based on filesystem state, combined with silent error handling and suspicious comments, strongly indicates malicious intent. All evidence points to a supply chain attack vector that could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration."
