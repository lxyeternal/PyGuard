  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without seeing the actual code, the precise intent cannot be determined. It may involve data processing, network communication, or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external data files. Specific source locations are not visible without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data output functions. Without code details, exact sink locations are unclear.",
  "flows": "Data flows likely start from sources such as environment variables or inputs and may end at sinks like network transmissions or file writes. Precise flow paths cannot be identified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without code content. Need to review the actual code for suspicious constructs like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis without the code. Cannot identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies without code snippets. A thorough review of the actual code is necessary for a meaningful assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious behavior or security risks. Cannot confirm or deny the presence of malware or security issues without code content.",
