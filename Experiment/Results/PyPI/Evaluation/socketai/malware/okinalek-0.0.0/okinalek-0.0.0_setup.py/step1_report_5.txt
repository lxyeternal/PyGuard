{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the 'okinalek' Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package metadata (name, description, author, author_email). No external inputs or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; static metadata is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "The 'author_email' appears to be a suspicious or placeholder email address that could be used to obscure identity or contact information; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with fixed string values for package metadata. The email address looks suspiciously like a placeholder or a non-legitimate address, which might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or hide true identity, but there are no dynamic or malicious code elements. No data input, environment variable usage, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious behavior itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic setup configuration with a potentially suspicious email address but contains no malicious code or security risks. It appears to be a standard package setup file with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
