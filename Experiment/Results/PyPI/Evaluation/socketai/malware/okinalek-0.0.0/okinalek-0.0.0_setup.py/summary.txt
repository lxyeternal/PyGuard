  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with suspicious contact email addresses. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior within the code itself. The suspicious email domains warrant external verification but do not impact the code's security posture. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to the contact info. Overall, the package appears safe but should be externally validated for the contact details."
