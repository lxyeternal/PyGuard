  "purpose": "A simple Python setup script defining package metadata with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, description, author, author_email, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment of metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious email addresses with domains like saucent.online and 2rwuvtol.saucent.online; empty version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata. The only notable anomalies are the email addresses with unusual domains, which could be used for malicious contact or social engineering. The 'version' field is empty, which is unconventional but not malicious. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and assign malware scores of 0. The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the suspicious contact info but no active malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest a benign package, with the main concern being external verification of the contact domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with suspicious contact email addresses. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior within the code itself. The suspicious email domains warrant external verification but do not impact the code's security posture. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to the contact info. Overall, the package appears safe but should be externally validated for the contact details.",
