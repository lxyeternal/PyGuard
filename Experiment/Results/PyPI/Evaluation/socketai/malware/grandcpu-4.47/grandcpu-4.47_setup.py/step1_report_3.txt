{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'grandcpu' Python package, including an obfuscated code segment likely intended for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads files (os.path.exists), executes a subprocess command with encoded payload, and imports setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes an obfuscated PowerShell command which can be a malicious payload, potentially performing unwanted actions or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code checks for a directory, then if not found, executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess, which could perform malicious activity without user knowledge.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess, which is suspicious. The command is hidden and encoded, indicating potential malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup import. It then attempts to run a subprocess with a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is a common tactic to conceal malicious code. The encoded command appears to perform network or system actions, typical of malicious payloads. The setup function call seems normal, but the prior obfuscated command is highly suspicious. The code employs a try-except block to suppress errors, which can hide failures or malicious activities. Overall, the main concern is the obfuscated PowerShell command, which suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. While the setup process itself appears legitimate, the embedded obfuscated payload poses a significant security risk. This package could potentially perform unauthorized actions or system compromise.",
