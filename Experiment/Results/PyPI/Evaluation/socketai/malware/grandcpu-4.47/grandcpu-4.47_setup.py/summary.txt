  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, which could be malicious. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics warrant a high malware and security risk score. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Overall, the package should be treated with caution."
