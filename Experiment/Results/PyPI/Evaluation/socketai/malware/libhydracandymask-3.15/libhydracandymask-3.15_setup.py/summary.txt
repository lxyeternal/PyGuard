  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, with indicators pointing toward malicious activity. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and external URL references warrants treating this package as potentially malicious or compromised. Further decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended to confirm malicious intent."
