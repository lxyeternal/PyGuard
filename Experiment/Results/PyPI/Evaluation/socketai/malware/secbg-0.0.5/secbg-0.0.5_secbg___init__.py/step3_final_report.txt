  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network transmission, file modifications, dynamic code execution results.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system, eval/exec), often via dynamic code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() with complex nesting, obfuscated code, hardcoded URLs or credentials, suspicious import patterns, dynamic features without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 lacks code, correctly scored as no risk. Report 2 describes code with obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, signs of concealment, and a malware score of 0.4 justified but possibly slightly high; a score of 0.3 could be considered. Obfuscation score of 0.7 aligns with description. Risk score of 0.55 reflects moderate concern. Reports 3, 4, and 5 show standard or benign code with no suspicious features, scores of 0 malware, 0 obfuscation, and low risk (0.2-0.3) are appropriate. Overall, scores are consistent with the described code features. Minor adjustments could be made for precision, but current scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The assessments are consistent and justified, with minor room for score fine-tuning based on further analysis.",
