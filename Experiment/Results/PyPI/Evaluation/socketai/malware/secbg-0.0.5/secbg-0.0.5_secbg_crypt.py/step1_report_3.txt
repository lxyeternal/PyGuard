{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encrypt and decrypt client IP addresses using AES encryption with CBC mode, likely for secure transmission or storage of IP data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'key' (encryption key), 'raw' (plaintext IP address), 'enc' (encrypted data).",
  "sinks": "Encrypted output (base64-encoded data), decrypted plaintext IP address.",
  "flows": "Input 'raw' is padded, then encrypted with a randomly generated IV; the IV + ciphertext are base64-encoded for output. During decryption, data is base64-decoded, IV extracted, then ciphertext decrypted to recover the plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs standard cryptographic practices with proper IV handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code are evident. No unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AES CBC mode encryption with PKCS#7 padding, using a secure random IV. It reads input data ('raw') and key, processes them securely, and outputs base64-encoded ciphertext. Decryption reverses this process safely. The code does not contain hidden backdoors, malicious data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of external 'common.crypt' module and 'Crypto' library appears standard for cryptographic operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of AES encryption/decryption for IP address data with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a standard cryptographic utility with proper use of IVs and padding.",
