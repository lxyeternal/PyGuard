{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encrypt and decrypt a client's IP address using AES encryption in CBC mode with base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encryption key as a parameter; it reads the raw IP data as a parameter; it also reads the encrypted data during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data is output as base64-encoded string; decryption returns plaintext IP data. No untrusted data is written or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "The functions take input data (raw IP or encrypted data), process it through AES encryption/decryption, and produce output (encrypted or decrypted IP).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard cryptographic libraries and proper IV handling; no suspicious or unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present. The padding method is manual but standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, encrypt_client_ip and decrypt_client_ip, that use AES in CBC mode for symmetric encryption of IP addresses. The padding is manually added to align data to block size. IV is generated securely with Crypto.Random. The key is passed as a parameter, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears to perform standard encryption/decryption tasks without any malicious behavior. No data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code operates locally and correctly manages cryptographic procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard AES encryption and decryption of IP addresses with proper IV handling and padding. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate cryptographic utility functions.",
