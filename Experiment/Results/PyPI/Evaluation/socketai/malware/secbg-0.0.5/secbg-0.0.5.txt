      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code's use of subprocess to import modules dynamically during setup is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect moderate malware suspicion (around 0.4) and high security risk (around 0.75), aligning with the potential for malicious code execution in untrusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the deserialization of protobuf data, which could be risky if the data is untrusted. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no malicious behavior is evident."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The assessments are consistent and justified, with minor room for score fine-tuning based on further analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated environment-aware patching tool capable of manipulating network requests and DNS resolution, which could be exploited for malicious purposes such as traffic interception or request masking. However, it does not contain active malware or payloads. Its high level of network and environment control warrants a moderate security risk score, but the malware score remains low due to the lack of explicit malicious payloads."
