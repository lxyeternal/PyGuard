  "conclusion": "The code's use of subprocess to import modules dynamically during setup is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect moderate malware suspicion (around 0.4) and high security risk (around 0.75), aligning with the potential for malicious code execution in untrusted environments."
