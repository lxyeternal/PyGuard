  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions for Django model objects and querysets, converting them into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf data.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "pb_to_dict(), data[extinfo_key]",
  "flows": "model_to_dict -> pb_to_dict (if with_extinfo) -> data[extinfo_key]",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Use of external functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily perform data serialization. 'model_to_dict' converts Django models to dicts. If 'with_extinfo' is True, 'pb_to_dict' processes protobuf data from 'obj.ext_info_proto()'. The 'serialize_queryset' applies 'serialize' over a queryset. There are no evident input/output vulnerabilities or malicious code. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious side-effects observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward serialization logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries for model and protobuf serialization, which are standard in Django projects.",
