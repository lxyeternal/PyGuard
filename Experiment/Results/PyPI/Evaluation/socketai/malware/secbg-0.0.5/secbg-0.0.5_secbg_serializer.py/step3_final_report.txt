  "purpose": "Functions serialize Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, optionally deserializing protobuf data from 'ext_info_proto()' if specified.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'obj' and 'obj.ext_info_proto()' within the 'serialize' function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially passes data from 'ext_info_proto()' to 'pb_to_dict()' which could process untrusted protobuf data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'obj' and 'obj.ext_info_proto()' into 'model_to_dict' and 'pb_to_dict' respectively, with optional inclusion of deserialized protobuf info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization of Django models and querysets. The only potential concern is deserialization of protobuf data via 'pb_to_dict()' from 'obj.ext_info_proto()'. If 'ext_info_proto()' returns untrusted data, this could pose a deserialization risk. However, the code itself does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted input directly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting minimal potential risk if 'ext_info_proto()' is untrusted. Overall, the code is benign, with the main consideration being the trustworthiness of protobuf data source.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the deserialization of protobuf data, which could be risky if the data is untrusted. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
