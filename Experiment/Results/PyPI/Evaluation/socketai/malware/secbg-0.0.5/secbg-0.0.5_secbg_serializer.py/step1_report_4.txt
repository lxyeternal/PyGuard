  "purpose": "The code serializes Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, with optional deserialization of protobuf extensions.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is being written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "model_to_dict reads data from the model; pb_to_dict processes protobuf data; no external data flow to network or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or external system access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data serialization of Django models. It relies on imported functions to convert models and protobuf objects into dictionaries. There are no input sources from untrusted external sources, no outputs to network or files, and no suspicious code constructs. The functions are simple and do not contain any malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign serialization utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard application code for data processing.",
