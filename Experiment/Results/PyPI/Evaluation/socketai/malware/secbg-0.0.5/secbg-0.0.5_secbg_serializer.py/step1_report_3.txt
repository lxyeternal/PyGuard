{
  "purpose": "To serialize Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, optionally including deserialized protobuf data.",
  "sources": "The functions read data from Django model objects (`obj`) and querysets (`qset`). They also call `obj.ext_info_proto()` to retrieve protobuf data.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `pb_to_dict()` on `obj.ext_info_proto()`, which could potentially process untrusted protobuf data if `ext_info_proto()` returns untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model objects (`obj`) through `model_to_dict()` and `pb_to_dict()` functions. Specifically, protobuf data from `obj.ext_info_proto()` is deserialized into a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The code relies on external functions for serialization and logging, which are not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serializes Django models and querysets into dictionaries. It optionally deserializes protobuf objects via `pb_to_dict()`. The protobuf deserialization is only invoked if `with_extinfo` is True, and it uses `obj.ext_info_proto()` as input. There are no evident data leaks, malicious code, or insecure patterns in the provided snippet. The functions depend on external modules for actual serialization logic, which are assumed to be standard and safe. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard serialization logic for Django models with optional protobuf deserialization. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this code snippet.",
