  "purpose": "The code serializes Django model objects and querysets into dictionaries, optionally including deserialized protobuf data.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "pb_to_dict() potentially processes protobuf data, but only if called explicitly.",
  "flows": "model_to_dict -> (optional) pb_to_dict if with_extinfo is True",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization functions for Django models and querysets. It uses external utilities for conversion, with optional protobuf deserialization. The functions are well-structured and do not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or security-sensitive actions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. The code appears to be a typical serialization utility without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply converts Django models and protobuf data into dictionaries, with optional deserialization.",
