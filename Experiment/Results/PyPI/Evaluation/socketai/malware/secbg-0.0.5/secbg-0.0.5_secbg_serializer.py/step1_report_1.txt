  "purpose": "The code provides serialization functions for Django model objects and querysets, converting them into dictionaries, with optional protobuf deserialization.",
  "sources": "model_to_dict(obj), obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over network or written to files, no untrusted input used unsafely",
  "flows": "model_to_dict reads model data; pb_to_dict reads protobuf data from obj.ext_info_proto()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions and defines two serialization functions. serialize converts a Django model instance to a dictionary, optionally including protobuf deserialization of an extension info field. serialize_queryset applies serialize to each object in a queryset. All operations are standard data transformations. No external data sources or sinks are involved. No unusual or malicious code behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward data serialization logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a utility for converting models into dictionaries for further processing or API responses.",
