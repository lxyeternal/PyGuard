  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Imports, environment variables, user input, network connections, file operations, subprocess calls",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, subprocess executions",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user input flows into network or file operations, possibly via functions or modules",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unusual variable usage, potential hidden behaviors, but no explicit malicious patterns identified",
  "analysis": "The code snippets involve standard data handling, environment variable access, and network or file operations. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Obfuscation is noted in some reports but not confirmed malicious. Security risks are minimal, primarily due to data flow from untrusted sources, but no active exploitation or malware is detected. Confidence levels are high where code is straightforward; moderate where obfuscation or ambiguity exists.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Obfuscation is minimal and not malicious. Security risks are low, and supply chain integrity appears intact based on the provided analysis. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with malware score at 0, obfuscation scores reflecting minor suspicion, and low security risk scores justified by the benign nature of the code.",
