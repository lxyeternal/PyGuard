  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a full-scale info stealer and sabotage agent. It demonstrates high malicious intent, with multiple exfiltration channels, anti-detection measures, and system compromise techniques. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is justified at 1.0."
