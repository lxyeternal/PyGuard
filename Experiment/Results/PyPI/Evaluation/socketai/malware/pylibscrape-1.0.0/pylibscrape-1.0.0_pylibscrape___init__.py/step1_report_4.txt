{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed to steal sensitive user information such as cookies, passwords, tokens, browser data, and system details, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks or upload to file hosting services. It also attempts to disable security features and kill security-related processes, indicating intent to sabotage or maintain persistence.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, clipboard contents, local browser storage files, SQLite databases in user directories, system commands, and network responses from specific URLs and APIs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network endpoints via HTTP POST requests, including sending stolen data (cookies, passwords, tokens, system info) to webhooks, as well as uploading files to external servers. Files are created, read, compressed, and transmitted without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser storage, clipboard, or network into decryption routines, then is assembled into messages and sent over network connections or uploaded as files. For example, cookies and passwords are extracted, decrypted, then sent via webhook; tokens are verified with Discord API and logged.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes webhook URLs, contains obfuscated or suspicious variable names, attempts to disable security processes, manipulates system registry and startup items, and includes multiple redundant or obfuscated functions. It also installs numerous packages unnecessarily, uses forced process termination, and attempts to disable security features. The presence of functions like 'Trust' that detect sandboxing or VM environments indicates anti-analysis measures.",
  "analysis": "The script initiates by installing multiple packages, then collects extensive system information, including hardware IDs, system details, and network info. It extracts browser credentials, cookies, history, and credit card info from various Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, decrypting stored data with Windows API calls. It also scans for Discord tokens, validates them, and logs user info. It includes functionality to steal Roblox cookies, Minecraft data, and screenshot captures. The code contains routines to kill security processes, disable security features, and manipulate browser files and registry entries to maintain persistence or sabotage security tools. All data is collected into text files and compressed into ZIP archives, then uploaded or sent via webhook with detailed system info, tokens, and collected data. Several functions are designed to evade detection by VM checks, process monitoring, and process termination. Overall, the code performs extensive, stealthy data exfiltration with clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a comprehensive info stealer and system sabotage tool. It targets browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info, exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads, and employs anti-debugging and process-killing techniques to evade detection. Its design and behaviors confirm high malicious intent with potential for significant harm if executed.",
