{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info stealer and sabotage tool, designed to extract passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency addresses, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads, while disabling security processes and manipulating browser and system files for persistence and evasion.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser data directories (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), registry keys (Discord tokens, Roblox cookies), clipboard data, system commands, network responses, and SQLite databases (Login Data, Cookies, History, Credit Cards).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external webhooks (kekwltd.ru, Discord), file uploads to anonymous hosts (transfer.sh), creation of ZIP archives of stolen data, modification of browser and Discord files to disable protections, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files, decrypted using Windows APIs, and assembled in memory; then transmitted via network requests or uploaded as ZIP files, often using multi-threading and broad exception handling to evade detection and ensure persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs and addresses, extensive use of obfuscation and misleading comments, broad exception suppression, process killing of security tools, registry modifications to disable protections, and anti-analysis checks (VM, sandbox detection).",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits extensive malicious behaviors including credential theft, token harvesting, cookie extraction, system info gathering, process sabotage, and data exfiltration. It employs multiple techniques for stealth, persistence, and evasion, with some obfuscation but no advanced encryption or packing. The activities are consistent with high-level malware functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a full-scale info stealer and sabotage agent. It demonstrates high malicious intent, with multiple exfiltration channels, anti-detection measures, and system compromise techniques. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is justified at 1.0.",
