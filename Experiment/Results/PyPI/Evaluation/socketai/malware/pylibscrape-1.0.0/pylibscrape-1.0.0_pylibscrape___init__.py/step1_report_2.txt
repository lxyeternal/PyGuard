{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data harvesting and exfiltration tool, primarily designed to extract sensitive user information such as browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. It then uploads this data to a remote server or file-sharing service, likely for malicious collection or resale.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser data directories, local SQLite databases for passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and browser extension files. It also reads system information via subprocess calls and registry queries, and clipboard data for wallet addresses and tokens. Network requests are made to external URLs for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to remote webhooks and URLs (e.g., kekwltd.ru, transfer.sh). Files such as passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and captured screenshots are uploaded and then deleted locally. The script kills processes, modifies browser and Discord files, and creates zip archives for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, file system (browser profiles, cookies, passwords, history), clipboard, and subprocess outputs. Extracted data is decrypted or parsed, then passed to functions that upload or send this data over the network to external servers via HTTP requests. Data flows from local system reading functions through decryption, parsing, and finally to network transmission for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The script hardcodes a webhook URL and various addresses, has numerous obfuscated or misleading comments, and employs broad exception handling that suppresses errors. It kills security-related processes, modifies browser profiles and Discord files, and automates file collection and uploading without user consent. It also uses random delays and dynamic filename generation. The presence of many potentially malicious modules (e.g., password and cookie stealers, process terminators, process killers) combined with obfuscation and extensive file system access suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a highly malicious stealer, capable of extracting passwords, cookies, tokens, browser history, credit card info, and clipboard data related to cryptocurrencies and accounts. It communicates with external servers for data exfiltration, employing obfuscation and broad exception handling to conceal failures. It kills security-related processes, attempts to disable or modify browser and Discord security features, and archives all stolen data for upload. Its multiple modules, including process terminators, registry checks, and system info gatherers, indicate efforts to evade detection and maintain persistence. Overall, it exhibits features typical of malware designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware, primarily a data-stealing Trojan targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, system info, and cryptocurrency addresses. It exfiltrates data to remote servers and attempts to disable security mechanisms and kill security-related processes. The structure, behavior, and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent and supply chain sabotage. It should not be used or trusted.",
