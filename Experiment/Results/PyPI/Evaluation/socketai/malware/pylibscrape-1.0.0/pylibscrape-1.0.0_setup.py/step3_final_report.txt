  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pylibscrape' Python library with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining version, description, author info, and the find_packages() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static setup code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools with hardcoded package metadata. It contains no external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, static configuration intended for package distribution. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static and straightforward nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. The only necessary adjustment is to set the overall security risk score to 0, reflecting the absence of risks.",
