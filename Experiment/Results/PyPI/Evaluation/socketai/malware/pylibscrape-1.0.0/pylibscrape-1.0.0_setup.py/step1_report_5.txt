  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'pylibscrape', used for package distribution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; all values are hardcoded in the script.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or file system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with package configuration parameters. All data is hardcoded; no external inputs, environment variables, or network interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is detected. The code appears to be a typical, benign Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
