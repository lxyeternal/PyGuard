  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup.py script for a Python package named 'pylibscrape'.\n- It imports standard setuptools functions.\n- It defines static variables for version, description, and long description.\n- It calls `setup()` with static, hardcoded package metadata.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign package configuration script.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign, standard setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Also standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Valid; benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Typical setup.py, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard, safe setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is a straightforward, static configuration script with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious code, or hidden backdoors.\n- The code is typical for package distribution and does not warrant a higher risk score.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI concur with the assessments provided. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the static nature of the code.",
