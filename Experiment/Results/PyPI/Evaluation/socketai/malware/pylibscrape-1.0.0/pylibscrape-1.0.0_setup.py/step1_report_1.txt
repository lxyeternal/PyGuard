  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pylibscrape' to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "No external input or data is read by this code; it only contains static configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or written; the code only calls setup() with predefined arguments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static values. No external input, environment variable, or dynamic code execution is present. The package appears to be intended for distribution and has no signs of malicious code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is benign and typical for Python package distribution.",
