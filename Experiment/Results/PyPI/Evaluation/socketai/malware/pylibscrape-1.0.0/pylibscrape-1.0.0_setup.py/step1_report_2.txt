{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'pylibscrape' with basic metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; static configuration code only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes setup configuration without untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The setup configuration appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines version and description variables, and calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, author info, descriptions, packages, dependencies, keywords, and classifiers. All elements are typical for a package setup script. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or potentially harmful operations. The code appears to be a standard package setup script without any suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.",
