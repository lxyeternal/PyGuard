  "flows": "The script defines package metadata and calls setup() to prepare the package; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata. It specifies package name, version, author details, description, and dependencies. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python library.",
