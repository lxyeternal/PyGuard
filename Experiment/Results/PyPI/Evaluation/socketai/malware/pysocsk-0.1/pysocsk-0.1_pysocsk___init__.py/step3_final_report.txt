  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, stdin, user inputs, and possibly network endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, dynamic code execution ('exec'), environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (stdin, env vars) potentially flow into network communication or dynamic execution, leading to data exfiltration or control signals.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' with untrusted input, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious IPs/domains, dynamic decoding, and runtime obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation through variable naming and dynamic 'exec' usage. It reads inputs from environment and stdin, then potentially communicates with external servers, indicating possible data exfiltration or command-and-control activities. The presence of hardcoded IPs and obfuscated code strongly suggests malicious intent. The code's structure and signals align with typical malicious behaviors such as backdoors or data theft. The overall suspicion level is high, with significant security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates likely malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The evidence indicates active malicious intent, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
