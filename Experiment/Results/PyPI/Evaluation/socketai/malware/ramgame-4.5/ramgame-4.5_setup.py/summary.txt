  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The code's core logic is benign, but the presence of encoded, hidden execution strongly suggests malicious behavior. The high scores in the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious pending payload decoding and further analysis."
