{
  "purpose": "Detects and evaluates potential malicious behavior in the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution and suspicious URL comments.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing base64-encoded PowerShell command; comment containing suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen call executing external PowerShell command with hidden window flags.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution -> execution of obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent error handling, execution during package setup, presence of suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check and, if 'tahg' does not exist, runs an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess with hidden window flags. The command is base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation, and the comment references a suspicious URL. Silent error handling suppresses failures, which is typical in malicious scripts. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially enabling remote code execution or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.75-0.8) are justified given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains high-confidence malicious indicators, notably obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, with suspicious URL comments. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. This represents a serious supply chain security concern and warrants further investigation or removal.",
