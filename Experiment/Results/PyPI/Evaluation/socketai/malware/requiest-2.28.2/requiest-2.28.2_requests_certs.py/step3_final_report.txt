  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, serving as an informational utility.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the print statement in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' as source; output via print as sink; flow is straightforward with no intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior; code is simple and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static script that imports a known function and prints its output. It contains no dynamic execution, no user input, no network activity, and no malicious or obfuscated elements. The purpose is purely informational, and there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero. The only minor consideration is that printing system paths could leak info in some contexts, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, non-malicious utility with no security risks or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could set the security risk to zero for consistency. Overall, it presents no security concern.",
