{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for validating SSL/TLS certificates.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the import statement 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the path to the CA bundle using print(where()), which could be considered a sink if this path is used in further security-sensitive operations, but by itself it is benign.",
  "flows": "Input: Import from certifi; Output: Printing the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for SSL/TLS certificate validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'where' from the certifi package to obtain the default CA bundle location. It then prints this path if run as a script. No external input is processed, and no insecure or malicious actions are performed. The purpose is purely informational, aiding in configuration or debugging. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to display the path to the default CA bundle provided by the certifi package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
