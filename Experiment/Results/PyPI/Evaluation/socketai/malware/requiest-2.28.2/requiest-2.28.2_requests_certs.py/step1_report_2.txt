{
  "purpose": "The script outputs the default CA certificate bundle location used by the certifi package, primarily for verification of HTTPS connections.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, which determines the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where) provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed to the console; no further data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code simply imports a library and prints a value.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints its output when run as a script. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or include any hardcoded secrets. The purpose appears to be to reveal the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a simple informational purpose. It merely outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from certifi. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
