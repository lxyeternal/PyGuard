{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, primarily used for establishing trusted SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, which provides the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the CA bundle path, which could be considered a sink if used maliciously to leak system information.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path (source), and the output is printed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code is straightforward and only accesses and prints a known function from a well-known library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, which is a standard library for SSL certificate validation. It then prints the path to the CA bundle when executed as a main program. The code performs a simple, benign operation with no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The functionality aligns with standard usage, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the path to a trusted CA bundle from the certifi package. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and performs a standard operation. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
