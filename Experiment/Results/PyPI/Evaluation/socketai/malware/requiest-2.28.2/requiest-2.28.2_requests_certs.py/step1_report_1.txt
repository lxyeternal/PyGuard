  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location using certifi's where() function.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> Call 'where()' -> Print result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and uses standard library and third-party package without modification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle. When run directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, uses standard modules, and contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a utility script for informational purposes only, with no data collection or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely to display the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
