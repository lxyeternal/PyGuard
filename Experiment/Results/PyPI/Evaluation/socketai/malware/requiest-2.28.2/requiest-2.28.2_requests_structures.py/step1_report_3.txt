{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from dictionary data passed to constructors and method calls such as update(), get(), __getitem__().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; it primarily manages internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (initial dictionaries or key-value pairs) flows into internal storage (_store, __dict__), with access through __getitem__, get(), and iteration methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code only implements standard dictionary-like behavior with case-insensitive features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages a case-insensitive dict-like structure, and LookupDict, a simple dict extension with an optional name attribute. The class methods are standard, with no unusual code execution or external communication. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The implementation focuses solely on internal data management and does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard, safe utility data structures used within the requests library. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
