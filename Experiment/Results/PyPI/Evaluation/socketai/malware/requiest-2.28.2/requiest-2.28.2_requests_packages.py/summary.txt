  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to maintain compatibility through unconventional sys.modules manipulations, including module aliasing and renaming. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The low malware score (0), slight obfuscation (0.2), and low security risk (0.2–0.4) are appropriate. While the module aliasing could be exploited for obfuscation, there is no active malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving compatibility needs with minimal security concern."
