  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric values to metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code is static metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets package metadata variables such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. The presence of decorative comments at the beginning appears to be ASCII art but does not impact execution or security. The metadata is standard for Python packages and does not indicate any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the 'requests' library source code.",
