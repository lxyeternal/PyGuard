  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely contains metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard metadata definitions with ASCII art comments. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides package metadata variables for the 'requests' library. The ASCII art comment is decorative and unrelated to executable code. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution present. The variables are straightforward string assignments with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard metadata file fragment for a well-known Python package with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
