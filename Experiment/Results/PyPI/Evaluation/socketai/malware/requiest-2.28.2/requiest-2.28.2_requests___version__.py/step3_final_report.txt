  "purpose": "Static metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, license, and descriptive information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.) and ASCII art comment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not involve data transfer or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata and a decorative comment. There are no dynamic operations, input/output handling, network calls, or executable logic. The ASCII art is purely decorative and does not impact execution. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. All signals indicate benign, static metadata. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata fragment with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
