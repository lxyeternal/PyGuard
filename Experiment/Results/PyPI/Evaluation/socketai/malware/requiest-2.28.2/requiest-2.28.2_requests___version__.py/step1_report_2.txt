  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants defining metadata such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, and __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string and integer values to variables that store package metadata information. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor any network or system calls. All variables are hardcoded with benign data. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package ('requests') with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a package setup or module initialization, containing only benign static data.",
