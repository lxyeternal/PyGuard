  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments at the beginning of the module (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or network communication.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns static string and integer values to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. All data appears static and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up metadata variables for the requests library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and some Unicode characters. No input reading, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent or anomalies. The code appears to be a straightforward metadata declaration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static metadata variables for the requests library. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
