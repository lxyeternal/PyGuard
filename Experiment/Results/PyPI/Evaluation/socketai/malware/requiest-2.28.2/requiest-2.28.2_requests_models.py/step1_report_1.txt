  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating HTTP communication.",
  "sources": "URL parsing and encoding, header validation, cookie handling, JSON encoding, request preparation, and response content reading.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending, URL handling, header and cookie setting, reading raw response data, JSON decoding, and response content processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URL, headers, cookies, body) -> processing and validation (e.g., URL encoding, header validation, cookie setup) -> request preparation (e.g., body encoding, headers, URL) -> response handling (e.g., reading content, decoding JSON, raising errors).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard request/response handling tasks. Usage of standard libraries like urllib3, encodings.idna, and cookie handling appears legitimate. No hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or system harm functions identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements core functionalities for HTTP request and response processing, including URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, body encoding (including multipart forms), and response content handling. All operations are consistent with standard HTTP handling procedures. No malicious payloads, code injections, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system manipulation are evident. The code's structure and use of well-known libraries suggest it is a typical component of the Requests library. There are no indicators of sabotage, backdoors, or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, legitimate implementation of HTTP request and response processing within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code functions as expected for an HTTP client library, with no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
