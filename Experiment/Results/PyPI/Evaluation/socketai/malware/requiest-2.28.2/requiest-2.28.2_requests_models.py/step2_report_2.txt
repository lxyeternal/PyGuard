  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of HTTP request/response handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code performs typical request/response functions, with no signs of malicious activity. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles request preparation, encoding, cookies, and response parsing. No malicious code or backdoors. Slight security risk (0.1) due to potential mishandling of data, but overall standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. The only minor concern is the small security risk score, possibly due to the handling of streams or cookies, but nothing malicious. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard request/response handling, encoding, validation, no suspicious activity. Low malware risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report aligns with the code. No malicious behavior is detected. The slight increase in security risk (0.2) is acceptable, possibly reflecting the general complexity of request handling but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request/response processing, no signs of malicious activity, safe data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No issues. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proper request/response management, no malicious or obfuscated code, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, accurate. No malicious signals or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the content. The code is a typical HTTP client implementation, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting the inherent complexity of request handling but not indicating any security threat.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. No malicious code, network activity, or sabotage detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code—core HTTP request/response handling—there's minimal risk. The small scores (0.1–0.2) are reasonable and conservative, acknowledging potential issues like mishandling streams or cookies but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (a very low, conservative estimate considering the complexity and handling of data streams and cookies)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client component. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with the code's content. No further action needed.",
