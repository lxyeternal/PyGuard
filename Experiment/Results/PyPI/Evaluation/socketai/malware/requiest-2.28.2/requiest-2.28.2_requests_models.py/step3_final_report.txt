{
  "purpose": "The code implements core HTTP request and response handling for the Requests library, including URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, request encoding, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks; also reads from raw response streams.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into headers, cookies, request body, and URL; response content is read and decoded.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and encoded in prepare methods; request data flows into request body; response content is read and decoded; headers and cookies are set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries and patterns consistent with legitimate HTTP client code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, open-source implementation of an HTTP request/response handler. It performs URL parsing, header validation, cookie handling, request encoding, and response parsing without any signs of sabotage or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or covert channels are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating code clarity. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the complexity of request handling but no vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure component of the Requests library, with no malicious, sabotage, or obfuscation signals. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
