      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation through multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, strongly suggesting malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The pattern is consistent and highly suspicious, justifying high malware and risk scores. Further payload analysis is necessary to confirm malicious activity, but current evidence indicates a significant security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to maintain compatibility through unconventional sys.modules manipulations, including module aliasing and renaming. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The low malware score (0), slight obfuscation (0.2), and low security risk (0.2–0.4) are appropriate. While the module aliasing could be exploited for obfuscation, there is no active malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving compatibility needs with minimal security concern."
