  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation through multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, strongly suggesting malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The pattern is consistent and highly suspicious, justifying high malware and risk scores. Further payload analysis is necessary to confirm malicious activity, but current evidence indicates a significant security threat."
