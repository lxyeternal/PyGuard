  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling import issues and version detection for the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chardet', 'simplejson', standard library modules, and version info via 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network, or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets flags and imports modules without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version detection logic, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility setup, attempting to import optional modules with fallbacks, detecting Python version, and defining type aliases. It performs no data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. All signals indicate benign, well-understood practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
