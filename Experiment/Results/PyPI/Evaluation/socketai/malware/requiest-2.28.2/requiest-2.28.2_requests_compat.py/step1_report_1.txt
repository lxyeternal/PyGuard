{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling encoding, JSON parsing, and URL manipulation across different Python versions in the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson', 'json', standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib), and the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None of the imported modules or variables are used in a way that processes untrusted data directly; no data is sent or received from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or potential security risks; code mainly sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python practices for compatibility and module imports. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, version detection, and compatibility setup for the 'requests' library. It imports 'chardet' with fallback, handles 'simplejson' with fallback, and defines version flags. No user input handling, no network operations, and no processing of untrusted data are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for a compatibility layer. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard imports and version checks without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
