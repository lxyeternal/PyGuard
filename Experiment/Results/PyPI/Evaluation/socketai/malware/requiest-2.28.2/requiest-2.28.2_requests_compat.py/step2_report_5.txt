  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a compatibility layer for the 'requests' library, handling Python 2/3 differences.\n- It performs conditional imports for optional modules ('chardet', 'simplejson') with fallbacks.\n- It defines version flags and type aliases.\n- No user input, network communication, or data processing occurs here.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is straightforward, relying on standard Python practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Malware score: 0**  \n- **Obfuscated: 0**  \n- **Risk score: 0**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that this code is purely for compatibility and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Malware score: 0**  \n- **Obfuscated: 0**  \n- **Risk score: 0**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is standard compatibility setup with no security risks. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Malware score: 0**  \n- **Obfuscated: 0**  \n- **Risk score: 0**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code's purpose is clear, with no malicious behavior. The scoring seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Malware score: 0**  \n- **Obfuscated: 0**  \n- **Risk score: 0**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a typical compatibility module, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Malware score: 0**  \n- **Obfuscated: 0**  \n- **Risk score: 0**  \n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly set to 0. The code performs standard imports and compatibility handling without any malicious or harmful actions.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, reflecting no security risks.\n\n**Final expert estimate:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate. The code is a benign compatibility layer with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for compatibility purposes.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
