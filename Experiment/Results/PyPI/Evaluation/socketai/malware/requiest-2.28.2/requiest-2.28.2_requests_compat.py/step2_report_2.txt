  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a compatibility layer for the 'requests' library, handling imports, version detection, and compatibility flags.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- The code uses standard Python practices, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The import attempts for optional modules ('chardet', 'simplejson') include fallbacks, which is standard practice.\n- The version detection and compatibility flags are straightforward and do not introduce security risks.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports, which is justified given the straightforward, standard code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The reports do not mention any indirect risks, such as the impact of conditional imports on downstream behavior, but since this code only sets up imports and flags, such risks are minimal.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n- The code is purely a compatibility setup, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- The import attempts are safe, and no network or external data handling occurs.\n- The use of 'sys.version_info' and conditional imports is standard for cross-version support.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a benign compatibility layer with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The reported scores are appropriate; I concur with them.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The confidence remains high, and no adjustments are necessary.",
