  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various dependencies related to HTTP handling and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries such as sys, collections, http, io, urllib, and conditional imports of chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, and json.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code segments; the code performs standard import resolution and compatibility handling without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility and import management module. It conditionally imports optional dependencies, defines compatibility flags, and re-exports modules and functions. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leakage, or backdoors. The code does not perform any network communication, data processing, or system modifications. All operations are standard for a library supporting HTTP and JSON functionalities with compatibility considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages imports and compatibility between Python versions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
