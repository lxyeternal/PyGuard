{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and import resolution for Python 2 and 3, handling dependencies such as chardet and simplejson, and defining compatibility aliases.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for chardet, simplejson/json, and standard library modules like collections, http, io, urllib",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network, or file operations present",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; mainly module imports and alias definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily manages compatibility and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by attempting to import 'chardet' or falling back to 'charset_normalizer'. It then detects Python version and sets flags for Python 2 or 3. It conditionally imports 'simplejson' or defaults to 'json' and its error class. Standard library modules are imported for compatibility. It defines type aliases for strings and numbers for compatibility purposes. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or network connections. The code serves as a compatibility layer without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a compatibility and import management module without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious code elements.",
