  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie management utilities, importing from internal modules and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows involve reading from responses and requests, storing, modifying, and retrieving cookies—nothing suspicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is typical for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, benign, with high confidence (1.0). Malware score: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and no malicious activity is evident. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, providing cookie utilities, reading request data and headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, cookie storage—standard operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity or data exfiltration. The code is typical for cookie management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, similar scope.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, extraction, management—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity. The 'add_header' method raises NotImplementedError, which is typical for interface compliance.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, benign, confidence 0.9. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities, handling request/response data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, jar management—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration. The threading lock usage is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious activity, confidence 1.0. Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, benign, and well within expected functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management utilities, similar to others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header formation, jar updates—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All functions are typical for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, primarily due to cookie handling functions, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented cookie management utility for the requests library. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code review.",
