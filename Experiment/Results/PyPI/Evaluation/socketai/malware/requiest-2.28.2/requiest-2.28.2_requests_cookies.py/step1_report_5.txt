{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including classes and functions for cookie extraction, management, and conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, and cookies; reads response headers and cookies; accesses internal cookie jar attributes.",
  "sinks": "Returns cookie header strings, modifies cookie jars (set, delete, update), and potentially affects cookie state in the application.",
  "flows": "Input request URL and headers -> create MockRequest object; response headers -> extract_cookies_to_jar; cookie jar manipulation -> get_cookie_header, set, delete, update cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and classes. Functions are typical for cookie management. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles cookie parsing, management, and extraction for the requests library, using standard Python modules and classes. The MockRequest and MockResponse classes provide wrappers to mimic expected interfaces. The functions manipulate cookie jars and cookies safely with no signs of malicious activity. No data leaks, network communications, or unauthorized actions are present. The functions are designed for typical cookie management tasks, with proper exception handling and no hidden or obfuscated behavior. The implementation appears standard and intended solely for cookie handling and compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It provides necessary functionality for cookie extraction, header formation, and jar manipulation without any suspicious or harmful features.",
