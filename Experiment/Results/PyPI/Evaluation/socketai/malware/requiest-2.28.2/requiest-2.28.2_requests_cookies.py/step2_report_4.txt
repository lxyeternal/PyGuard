  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities, no issues.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leaks or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical cookie management implementation.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (low, given the nature of the code)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities, no issues.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie handling code, low risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (still low, acceptable)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management utilities, standard.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** The only notable point is the `add_header` method raising `NotImplementedError`, but this is clearly for interface compliance, not malicious.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected; code is benign.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie handling, no issues.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, low security risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie extraction and management, standard.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly standard, benign cookie utilities.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are zero.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of cookie management utilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, transparent implementation of cookie management functions for the requests library. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no network activity beyond standard header handling, and no signs of malware or sabotage. The scores assigned across all reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, well-understood nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical, safe cookie management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
