  "sources": "Reading request headers, request URLs, response headers, and cookie attributes.",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage, header generation, cookie extraction into jars.",
  "flows": "Request data (headers, URL) to cookie management functions, cookies stored/modified in jars, headers generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity or data exfiltration, standard cookie handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured utilities for cookie management, including classes like MockRequest, MockResponse, and RequestsCookieJar, and functions for creating, extracting, and merging cookies. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions perform expected tasks without network activity or data leaks. The code is transparent, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The 'add_header' method raising NotImplementedError is a standard interface pattern, not malicious. The threading lock usage is typical for thread safety. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical cookie handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. No malicious, sabotage, or obfuscated behavior is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
