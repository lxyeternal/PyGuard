  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies in Python HTTP requests, including creating, extracting, and managing cookies via a CookieJar interface.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request objects, request headers, and cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie headers for requests, manipulates cookies in the jar, and serializes cookie data.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from response headers into CookieJar, produces Cookie header strings from CookieJar, and manages cookie addition/removal based on domain/path/name filters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL or domain usage, no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution, and no indirect data exfiltration or backdoors present. The code mainly manipulates cookies and HTTP headers in standard ways.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including creating cookies, converting Morsel objects, extracting cookies from responses, and providing dictionary-like access to cookies. All functions follow typical patterns for cookie handling without suspicious or malicious logic. No network communication or system manipulation occurs. The code relies on standard Python modules and typical request/response handling without any obfuscated or hidden behaviors. The code's structure and functions are consistent with legitimate cookie management tasks, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of cookie handling utilities for HTTP requests, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The overall security risk is low.",
