{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception and warning classes for the requests library, facilitating error handling during HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module; class initializations and attribute assignments within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely establishes class structures without runtime data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class inheritance and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception and warning class definitions used for error handling in the requests library. It imports external exception classes and extends them with custom docstrings and initializations. There are no network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as structural components for error management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural and does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
