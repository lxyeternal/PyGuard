  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of exception and warning class definitions for the requests library.\n- The code primarily imports exceptions from external modules and defines subclasses with descriptive docstrings.\n- No network operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Exception initializations and attribute assignments are standard and do not process untrusted data directly.\n- The code appears purely structural, intended for error handling.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently affirm that there are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n- The only minor variation is the confidence level (mostly 1, one at 0.95), but all agree on the benign nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected in any report.\n- The code does not perform any I/O, network calls, or data leaks.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which is justified because the code is purely structural and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured exception class hierarchy for the requests library.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard exception and warning class definitions module. It does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
