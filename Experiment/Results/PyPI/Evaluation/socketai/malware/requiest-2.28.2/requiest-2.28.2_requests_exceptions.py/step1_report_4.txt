{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Standard imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compatibility module; exception class initializers and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising points such as in constructors; potential data exposure is minimal but could occur if exceptions include sensitive request/response data.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger exception instantiation; no data flows from untrusted sources into security-critical sinks beyond standard error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; exception hierarchy and class structures appear standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes for request errors, inheriting from standard Python and HTTP-specific exceptions. It includes custom initialization for certain errors, like JSONDecodeError, to preserve context. No suspicious code or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious network activities are present. The code is well-structured, adheres to standard patterns, and lacks anomalies or obfuscated sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical error handling module with no suspicious behavior detected.",
