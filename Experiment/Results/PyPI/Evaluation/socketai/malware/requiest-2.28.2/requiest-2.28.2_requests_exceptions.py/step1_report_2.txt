  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "Exception constructors and attribute assignments; no data sinks or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects and setting of attributes such as response and request objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for a HTTP request handling library. It imports standard exceptions, extends them with custom classes, and manages exception initialization, particularly for JSON decoding errors. The code appears to follow standard patterns for exception class definitions without any suspicious behavior or data leaks. No external network activity, cryptic code, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations beyond exception handling.",
