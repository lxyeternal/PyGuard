  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings.\n   - No actual executable logic, data processing, or external calls are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the structural nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and does not contain malicious logic.\n   - No discrepancies or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.95), reflecting minimal security concern.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - Since the code is purely structural, no elevated risk scores are justified.\n   - The highest risk score of 0.95 in report 4 appears slightly conservative but acceptable, considering the potential for misuse if exception data leaks sensitive info.\n   - Overall, risk scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware presence.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclude the code is standard and safe.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No contradictions are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for the requests library.**  \n**It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.**  \n**The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.**\n\n### My Personal Estimates:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly for potential information leakage if exception data is sensitive, but generally very low)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and free of security issues. No further action is necessary.",
