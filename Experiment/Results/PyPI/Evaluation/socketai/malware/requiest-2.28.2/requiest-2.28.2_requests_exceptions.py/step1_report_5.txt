{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library for HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility modules; class initializations and attribute accesses within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involving untrusted data or external effects; exception raising is standard for error handling.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute assignment flows; no data from untrusted sources processed or propagated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic detected; code adheres to standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes related to HTTP request errors, inheriting from built-in and third-party exception classes. Constructors are used for setting attributes, with no processing of external or untrusted data. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure and imports are typical for a Python error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definitions module for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs straightforward error and warning class definitions without external data processing or harmful operations.",
