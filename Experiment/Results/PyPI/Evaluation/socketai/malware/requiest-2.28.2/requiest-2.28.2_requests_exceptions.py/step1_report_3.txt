{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for the requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compat module, and defines custom exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly defines exception classes and imports.",
  "flows": "The code initializes exception instances and sets attributes, but does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for handling HTTP-related errors, inheriting from base exception types. It imports external exception classes and defines subclasses with descriptive docstrings. No input/output handling or network operations are performed here. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears standard for an exception module, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for request error handling. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code is safe and straightforward.",
