  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling errors and warnings within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module.",
  "sinks": "Exception class initializations, attribute assignments, and inheritance chains.",
  "flows": "Import of external exceptions -> class definitions -> instantiation of exceptions during error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or hidden code. The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception and warning classes for the requests library. It imports exceptions from external modules, extends or combines them to create specific error types, and defines warnings for deprecation and dependency issues. No code executes untrusted input, no network operations, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any I/O, external communications, or dynamic code execution. It appears purely structural for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks. It simply organizes error handling and warning messages. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
