  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project, including version checks, dependencies, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md for long description, command-line arguments for publishing.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes external version file; os.system() executes publish commands.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes code from '__version__.py'; command-line argument 'publish' triggers os.system() calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run external code; typo in package name 'requiest'; no obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with version enforcement, dependency declarations, and publish commands. The use of exec() on a trusted version file is common but could be risky if the file is compromised. The os.system() calls are static and only triggered explicitly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The typo in the package name is likely unintentional. Overall, the code is typical for its purpose, with minor security considerations mainly around exec().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be trusted. No malware or malicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
