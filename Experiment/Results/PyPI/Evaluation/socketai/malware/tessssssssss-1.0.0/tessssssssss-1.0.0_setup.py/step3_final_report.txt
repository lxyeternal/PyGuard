{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation by sending it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, potentially for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) → request parameters → requests.get() → external server",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs automatically during installation without user consent; URL is suspicious; no obfuscation or encryption used",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation, which is unusual and privacy-invasive. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The network request is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The behavior aligns with covert data collection or reconnaissance activities. The scores assigned in the reports generally reflect high suspicion, with malware scores mostly at 0.8-1.0, justified by the covert exfiltration. The security risk is similarly high, given the privacy invasion. The only inconsistency is in Report 4, which assigns a malware score of 0.5; this should be increased to at least 0.8 to better reflect the malicious behavior. Overall, the behavior is malicious, and the scores should be adjusted accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and the scores are appropriate, with a minor adjustment needed for Report 4's malware score. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for malicious activity.",
