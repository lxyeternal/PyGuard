{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a specified remote URL during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() used to gather hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external server, which could potentially be malicious or used for tracking.",
  "flows": "Collected system info (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source variables directly into the request parameters, then sent via requests.get() to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an unsolicited network request during installation without user consent, which is suspicious. The URL is obfuscated and suspiciously structured; the domain resembles a Burp Collaborator or similar test server. The request includes system info, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common modules for system info and network requests. It defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard install, gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL. This behavior occurs during package installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. The URL appears suspicious and is likely intended for testing or malicious purposes. The code does not contain malicious code execution or data exfiltration beyond this info gathering and transmission, but the behavior is intrusive and suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unexpected and intrusive data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The URL and behavior suggest tracking or reconnaissance activities. It poses a security risk due to unsolicited data transmission without user awareness.",
