{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - these read system information; requests.get() - sends data over the network during installation.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sends data to an external URL, potentially leaking system info to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info (source) and then transmits it via requests.get() (sink), establishing a data flow that leaks information upon package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system data to a remote server during package installation, which is not typical or necessary for package setup; the URL used appears suspicious and external.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup tools but introduces a custom install command that gathers hostname, current directory, and username. These details are then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior indicates data exfiltration during package installation, which is not expected for benign packages and raises security concerns. The URL used is suspicious and may be malicious or maliciously intended for tracking or data theft. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs beyond this network request.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation. It appears designed to surveil or collect user system data covertly. This behavior poses security risks and indicates potential malicious intent.",
