{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with a custom installation process that reports system information upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "During the custom install process, system information (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and transmitted to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system data to an external, potentially malicious server during installation. No user input is sanitized or validated. The URL used for data exfiltration is suspicious, designed for command and control or data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup and install modules, then extends the install class to override the run method. Inside run(), it collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes a GET request to a suspicious URL with this data as parameters. The URL appears to be associated with a Burp Collaborator, indicating potential malicious intent. This behavior is unusual for a legitimate package, which should not exfiltrate system information during installation. The rest of the code simply defines package metadata. The behavior indicates a clear attempt at data collection without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation. The code is designed to secretly send system details to an external server, which could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or malicious data collection. The overall security risk is high due to this covert data transmission.",
