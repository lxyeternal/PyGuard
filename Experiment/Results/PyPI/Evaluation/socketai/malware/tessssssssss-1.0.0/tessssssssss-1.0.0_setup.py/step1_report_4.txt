  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to send system information to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.get() to an external server.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are sent to the sink (requests.get) as URL parameters during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request to an external domain during installation, which is unusual for a standard package and may indicate data exfiltration. The target URL appears suspicious and could be malicious or used for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules to gather system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and then makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server during installation. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious, and the request is made without any user consent or clear purpose. This behavior resembles tracking or data exfiltration, which is unusual for a normal package. No other malicious actions are detected, but this behavior raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing potentially malicious behavior by sending system information to an external server during package installation, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. It is suspicious and should be reviewed further. No other malicious code or backdoors are detected.",
