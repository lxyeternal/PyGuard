  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious or obfuscated malware, including heavy use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system info collection. While the actual payload remains unknown without decoding the base64 string, the techniques used are typical of malicious scripts. Therefore, it should be treated as high risk and potentially malicious until further analysis of the embedded payload confirms its intent."
