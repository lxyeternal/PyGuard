{
  "purpose": "The script gathers and displays comprehensive system information including OS details, boot time, CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform.uname(), psutil functions (boot_time, cpu_count, cpu_freq, cpu_percent, virtual_memory, swap_memory, disk_partitions, disk_usage, disk_io_counters, net_if_addrs, net_io_counters).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data directly to standard output (print statements). No data is sent over network or stored externally within this script.",
  "flows": "Source data from psutil and platform modules flows directly into print functions for display; no further processing or data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard system libraries, and only outputs system info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (psutil, platform, datetime) and defines a utility function for formatting byte sizes. It retrieves various system metrics including OS info, boot time, CPU details, memory, swap, disk partitions and usage, network interfaces, and I/O counters. All data is printed to the console. No user input, external data sources, or network transmissions are involved. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or potentially malicious constructs. It solely reads system data and displays it, consistent with system diagnostics or monitoring tools. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard system information gathering script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs diagnostic functions without collecting or transmitting sensitive data beyond system metrics. Overall security risk is negligible.",
