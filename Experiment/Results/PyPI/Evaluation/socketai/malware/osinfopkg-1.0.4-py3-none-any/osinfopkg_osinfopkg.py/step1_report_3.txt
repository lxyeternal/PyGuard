{
  "purpose": "Gather and display comprehensive system information including hardware specs, memory, disk, and network details.",
  "sources": "Reading system information from platform, psutil, datetime modules, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code only reads and prints system data without writing or transmitting untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; data is collected from trusted system sources and printed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code does not perform network communication beyond system info retrieval, nor does it execute dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports trusted modules (psutil, platform, datetime) to gather system hardware and network info. It defines a utility function for size formatting. The code sequentially retrieves system info, memory, swap, disk, and network data, printing details to the console. All data sources are local and system-based. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. No external network communication, command execution, or credential handling is evident. The code functions solely for informational purposes and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads system parameters and displays them, with no external communication or malicious behavior detected.",
