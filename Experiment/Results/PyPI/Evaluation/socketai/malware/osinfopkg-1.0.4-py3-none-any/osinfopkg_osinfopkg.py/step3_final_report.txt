{
  "purpose": "The code collects and displays system information such as OS details, boot time, CPU, memory, disk, and network stats using standard Python libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads system data via psutil, platform, and datetime modules; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using print statements; no data transmission or external storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system API calls through variables to print functions; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses well-known modules to gather system info and outputs it directly. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The data flow is simple and benign, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system information gathering script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. All signals indicate a safe, standard utility. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
