{
  "purpose": "To collect and display system information including hardware, memory, disk, network, and uptime details.",
  "sources": "Reads system data via psutil and platform libraries; retrieves timestamps and system configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; outputs data to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system calls and printed directly; no data is transmitted over networks or stored persistently within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code performs standard system info retrieval without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses psutil and platform libraries to gather system metrics like CPU, memory, disk, network, and boot time. It formats and prints this data without user input or external data sources. No code executes untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations or data exfiltration. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a legitimate system information script, common for monitoring or diagnostic purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign system information gathering script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply collects and displays system metrics. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
