{
  "purpose": "The script gathers and displays comprehensive system information including OS details, boot time, CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics.",
  "sources": "psutil functions for system metrics; platform.uname() for system info; datetime for formatting timestamps",
  "sinks": "print statements that output gathered data to the console",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved via psutil and platform APIs, then directly printed; no untrusted input is processed or transmitted externally",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling or network communication beyond standard system info gathering",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses psutil and platform modules to fetch system metrics and outputs them via print statements. It does not process or store untrusted input, does not perform network communication beyond gathering network interface info, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. All data sources are local system APIs, and there are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The purpose appears to be legitimate system monitoring or diagnostics.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward system information script with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely reads system data and outputs it locally. No malware, suspicious activity, or security risks are detected.",
