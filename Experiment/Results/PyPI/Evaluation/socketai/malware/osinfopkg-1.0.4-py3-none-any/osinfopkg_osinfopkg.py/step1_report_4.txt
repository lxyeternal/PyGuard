{
  "purpose": "The script gathers and displays detailed system information including hardware specs, memory, disk, network, and uptime metrics.",
  "sources": "Data is obtained from system libraries such as psutil and platform, which read system data like hardware details, memory, disk, and network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "The code only outputs data to the console; there are no sinks that transmit untrusted data externally, save for printing to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls (psutil functions, platform.uname(), datetime.fromtimestamp()) to print statements; no untrusted external input influences the data collection or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The functions used are standard for system diagnostics. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code sequentially collects system information such as OS details, boot time, CPU specs, memory, disk usage, and network interfaces using psutil and platform libraries. It formats and prints this data to the console. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code operates within typical system diagnostics scope, with no external data transmission, code injection, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard system info script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward system information gathering script without any malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. It merely collects and displays system data for diagnostic purposes. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
