  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of validation. It likely contains or executes malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk. The high scores are appropriate, and further analysis of the decoded payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
