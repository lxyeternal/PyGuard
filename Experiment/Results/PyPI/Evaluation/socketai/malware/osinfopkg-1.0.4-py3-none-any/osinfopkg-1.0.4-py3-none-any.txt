      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of validation. It likely contains or executes malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk. The high scores are appropriate, and further analysis of the decoded payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."

The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk. The assessments are consistent and justified."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious or obfuscated malware, including heavy use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system info collection. While the actual payload remains unknown without decoding the base64 string, the techniques used are typical of malicious scripts. Therefore, it should be treated as high risk and potentially malicious until further analysis of the embedded payload confirms its intent."
