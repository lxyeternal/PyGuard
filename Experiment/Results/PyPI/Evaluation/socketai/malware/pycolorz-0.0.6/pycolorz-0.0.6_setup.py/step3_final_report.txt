{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, then embeds a malicious payload that downloads and executes remote code during installation.",
  "sources": "The embedded code in the temporary Python file that fetches remote content from 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/39kv9/raw' using urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of remote code via exec() and running the temporary file with the system's Python executable through _ssystem().",
  "flows": "The code creates a temporary file with malicious code, then executes it directly via exec() and via system call, leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded code that downloads and executes remote content during setup, hardcoded suspicious URL, use of exec() on fetched data, and system call to run the temporary script.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a clear malicious payload embedded after the legitimate setup code. It creates a temporary Python script that fetches code from a suspicious URL and executes it via exec(). It then attempts to run this script using a system call, which would execute the remote code. The pattern indicates remote code execution capability, a severe security risk. The malicious code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and embedded in a common setup script, making it highly suspicious. The remote URL and execution pattern confirm malicious intent. The malware score is therefore set to 1, with high security risk, and low obfuscation. The code's behavior is unequivocally malicious, posing a significant threat during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, embedding a remote code fetch and execution payload within a setup script. It poses a high security threat, and the package should be considered compromised. The scores should reflect maximum severity.",
