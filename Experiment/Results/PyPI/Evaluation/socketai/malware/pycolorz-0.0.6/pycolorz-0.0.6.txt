      "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential for misuse via dynamic execution functions warrants cautious monitoring but does not justify increased malware or obfuscation scores. The overall security risk remains low. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a recommended slight increase in risk for code containing dynamic execution functions if their presence is confirmed."
