  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that are highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. The setup code itself is benign, but the embedded payload significantly elevates the security risk. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms safety."
