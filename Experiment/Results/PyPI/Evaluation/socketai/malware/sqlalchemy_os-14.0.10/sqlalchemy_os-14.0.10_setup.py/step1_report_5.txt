The embedded code, when decoded, appears to import modules, perform network requests, and interact with files.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code first sets up a package with setuptools, which is typical for Python package distribution. It then checks for a specific directory 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if it exists. Next, it imports several modules, including requests, tempfile, subprocess, and base64. A base64-encoded string is decoded and executed via exec(). The decoded code imports os and requests, performs a network request to a URL, and calls a function with the result. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and exec() raises suspicion of hidden or malicious intent, as it can conceal malicious code from casual inspection. The code does not perform any overt malicious actions in the visible segment but hides its true behavior. Its structure and the use of encoded execution suggest possible malicious intent, especially if the decoded code performs actions like data exfiltration or system manipulation.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The script includes standard package setup code but then executes obfuscated code using exec() on a base64-encoded string. This technique is often associated with malicious behavior or code hiding. Although the decoded code imports modules and performs network requests, its purpose is unclear without decoding. The overall design indicates a high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscation, hidden network activity, and dynamic code execution.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.9,\n  \"malware\": 0.75,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.8\n}",
