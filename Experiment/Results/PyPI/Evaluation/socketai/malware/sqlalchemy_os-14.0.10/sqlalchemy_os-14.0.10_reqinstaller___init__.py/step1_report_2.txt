  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a specified URL and execute it locally.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch data from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() to execute the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data -> data is written to a temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a remote executable without validation or verification, no checksums or signatures, direct execution of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL, saves it to a temporary location, and then executes it without any verification. This pattern is typical of malicious activity such as executing malicious payloads fetched from external sources. There are no input validation, signature checks, or sandboxing measures, increasing the risk. The direct execution of an untrusted remote file is a common tactic in malware delivery. The code structure is straightforward, but the behavior is suspicious due to the lack of safety checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and runs an external executable without validation, indicating highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It resembles common malware patterns involving remote payload delivery and execution.",
