  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a URL and run it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe' used by requests.get() to fetch data.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call([exe_path]) executes the downloaded executable, potentially running untrusted code.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves content from the URL -> saves to a temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and immediately executes a binary without validation or user consent, which is highly suspicious. No verification of the file's integrity or origin is performed. The use of temp files and direct execution indicates potentially malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script fetches a binary executable from a remote server, stores it temporarily, and executes it directly. This pattern is common in malware delivery, especially when no checksums, signatures, or user prompts are implemented. The code does not verify the source or integrity of the file before execution, raising high suspicion of malicious activity. The direct execution of an external binary from an external source without validation is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates highly suspicious behavior indicative of malware or malicious activity, as it downloads and executes an external binary without validation. It should be considered malicious or potentially harmful.",
