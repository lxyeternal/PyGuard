  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated payload execution during package setup, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Hidden PowerShell command execution, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers conditional execution of obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded command, suppressed error handling, suspicious comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip', silent execution with hidden window flags.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check; if absent, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, indicating stealth. The command is obfuscated, and the comment suggests malicious intent. Error suppression may hide failures. The pattern matches common supply chain attack techniques involving stealthy payload delivery during package installation. The obfuscation level and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious activity. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the evidence. Confidence levels (~0.9) are appropriate due to clear obfuscation and stealth behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. It poses a significant security threat as a potential supply chain attack vector. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and embedded URL strongly support classifying this as malicious activity.",
