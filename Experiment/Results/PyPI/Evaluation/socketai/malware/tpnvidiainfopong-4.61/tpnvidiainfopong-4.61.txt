      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. It poses a significant security threat as a potential supply chain attack vector. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and embedded URL strongly support classifying this as malicious activity."
