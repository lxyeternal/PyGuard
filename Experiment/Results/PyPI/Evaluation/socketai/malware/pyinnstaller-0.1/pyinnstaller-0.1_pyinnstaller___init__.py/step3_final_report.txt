  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as os, sys, subprocess; reads environment variables; handles data inputs/outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables or network connections; dynamic code execution points if eval/exec are used.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables and inputs; sinks include network connections, file writes, or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only imports; suspicion of obfuscation or dynamic execution functions (eval/exec) without explicit code; placeholder or empty scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly minimal or benign, with no evidence of malicious activity. Suspicion arises mainly in reports mentioning dynamic code execution or obfuscation, but without explicit code, these are speculative. The scores assigned—malware near zero, slight suspicion of obfuscation, and low risk—are consistent with the descriptions. Report 2's elevated malware score (0.2) is justified given the suspicion but should be lowered if no code confirms dynamic execution. Overall, the assessments are cautious yet appropriate, aligning with the limited code context.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' evaluations are reasonable and consistent with the code snippets. No significant malicious or obfuscation activity is confirmed. The scores reflect a low threat level, with slight suspicion in ambiguous cases. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture appears benign.",
