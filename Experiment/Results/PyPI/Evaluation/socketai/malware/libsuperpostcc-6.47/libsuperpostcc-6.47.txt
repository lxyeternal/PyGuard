      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands referencing suspicious domains during package setup. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and further analysis, including decoding the payloads and monitoring network activity, is recommended."
