  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed during setup, indicative of malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoors. The silent error handling and encoding conceal the payload, warranting high security concern. The scores assigned are appropriate, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its payload."
