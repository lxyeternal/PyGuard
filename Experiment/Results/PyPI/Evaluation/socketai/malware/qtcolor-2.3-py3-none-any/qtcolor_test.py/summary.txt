  "conclusion": "The script employs obfuscation, dynamic execution, and self-deletion, which are hallmark techniques of malware. Although the actual payload content isn't visible, the pattern and techniques used suggest high malicious potential. The malware score is set to 1 due to the high suspicion of malicious intent, and the security risk score is similarly high. This code should be treated as malicious or suspicious until further static or dynamic analysis confirms benign behavior."
