  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "PowerShell process execution with encoded command, hidden window, and silent error handling.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Conditional execution of encoded PowerShell command -> Hidden, silent process run.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command, execution with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, broad try-except blocks suppressing errors, conditional run based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a benign-looking setup script with an embedded obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently if 'tahg' does not exist. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression are classic indicators of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8-0.9, obfuscated 0.8-0.9, risk 0.8-0.9) are justified given the suspicious behavior. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious activity. The overall conclusion is that this package exhibits high malicious potential and should be treated with suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high scores are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious.",
