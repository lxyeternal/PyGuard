  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security risks in the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Imported modules ('os', 'sys', 'subprocess'), environment variables, network interactions, dynamic code execution, variable names, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input handling, environment variable usage, network communication, dynamic code execution functions, output or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted inputs flow into code execution, network transmission, or system commands; obfuscation and dynamic code can obscure these flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, signs of dynamic code execution, unvalidated environment variables, suspicious network activity, inconsistent obfuscation levels, suspicious patterns without concrete malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that simple module imports ('os', 'sys', 'subprocess') without evidence of misuse are low risk. Lack of code snippets limits definitive conclusions, but the reasoning aligns with standard security assessments. Obfuscation and dynamic code execution signs increase suspicion but are not definitive without concrete malicious actions. Suspicious behaviors like unvalidated environment variables and network activity suggest higher risk. Scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with some room for minor adjustments: increasing malware scores for reports indicating obfuscation or suspicious patterns, and adjusting obfuscation scores where signs are strong. The overall analysis supports that the highest concern lies with report 5, which warrants the highest malware and security risk scores, while reports 1-3 remain low risk. The scores should reflect suspicion levels, with moderate adjustments based on the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are largely consistent with the reports' descriptions. Obfuscation and dynamic code execution signs increase suspicion but lack definitive malicious actions. The highest risk is associated with report 5, which involves unvalidated environment variables and network activity. Adjustments to scores—particularly increasing malware and obfuscation scores where justified—would better align with the observed behaviors. Overall, the risk levels are appropriate given the evidence, but vigilance is advised, especially for obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
