      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, likely malicious. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL indicate a significant security threat. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further decoding and analysis of the payload are performed."
