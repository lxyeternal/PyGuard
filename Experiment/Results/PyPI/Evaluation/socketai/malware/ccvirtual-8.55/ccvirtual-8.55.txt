      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious or backdoor activities, primarily due to the obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state. While the setup code appears benign, the payload's intent warrants further decoding and analysis. The high obfuscation and concealment strongly suggest malicious intent, and the package should be treated with caution until the payload is examined."
