{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then uploading this data to remote servers, particularly via Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services. It also includes functionality for collecting system information and potentially propagating itself.",
  "sources": "User input sources include log files (e.g., .log, .ldb), browser storage directories, local files such as 'Login Data' and 'Cookies', and environment variables. Data is read from browser directories, local state files, and log files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into remote servers via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and file upload services ('uploadToAnonfiles'). Sensitive data like tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are transmitted externally. Files are also written locally and then uploaded.",
  "flows": "Sources like browser data, local system files, and log files are read and processed to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. Extracted data flows into upload functions which send data to remote servers via HTTP requests or file uploads, often using hardcoded webhook URLs and external hosting services.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains hardcoded webhook URL, which is used for exfiltration. It auto-installs missing Python modules, indicating persistence or setup behavior. Uses thread-based parallel processing for data collection and zipping files for exfiltration. The code kills processes related to cryptocurrency wallets and gaming, indicating malicious intent. Obvious indicators include self-copying to startup folder, self-propagation, and data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a malicious data stealer designed to extract sensitive information from various browsers, applications, and system files. It installs itself in the startup folder for persistence, kills processes associated with wallets or games to access files, and exfiltrates tokens, passwords, cookies, and files to remote servers via Discord webhook and anonymous file hosting. It also gathers system info and user geolocation data. The code uses threading to perform concurrent data collection, handles decryption of encrypted data using Windows API calls, and automates installation of missing Python modules. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, self-copying, process termination, and exfiltration routines strongly indicate malicious behavior with high stealth potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive information stealer targeting user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and system data. It exfiltrates data to remote servers, kills processes to access locked files, persists via startup folder, and employs multiple evasion techniques. Its behavior and indicators clearly classify it as malware intended for unauthorized data theft.",
