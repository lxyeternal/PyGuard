{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from the user's system and send this data to a remote Discord webhook, effectively acting as a stealer and data exfiltration tool.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (browser databases, cookies, tokens), user input from logs, and system paths related to browsers, messaging apps, and other installed software.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted data to a specified Discord webhook via HTTP requests; writes data to temporary files; uploads files to external services like gofile.io; kills processes related to cryptocurrency wallets, browsers, and gaming applications; creates ZIP archives of files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, local storage, environment variables, and user logs through functions like getT0k3n, getP4ssw, getC00k13, which decrypt or extract sensitive info, then to the upload functions that exfiltrate via network requests to webhooks or upload services.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, extensive process-killing commands to terminate security or browser processes, obfuscation of variable names, repeated code segments for file extraction and upload, suspicious keyword lists for file scanning, and automated installation of dependencies without user consent. The code contains functions for stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and files, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a credential and data stealer, targeting browsers, Discord tokens, cookies, and files. It decrypts stored browser data, extracts tokens from logs, and uploads sensitive information to external servers. The code also kills related processes to prevent detection or interference. It includes mechanisms to install dependencies, copy itself to startup folders, and perform obfuscated file searches for sensitive data. Overall, the script demonstrates clear malicious intent, with multiple indicators of data theft, process termination, and network exfiltration. Its design aligns with typical malware behaviors aimed at stealth, data collection, and remote exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed explicitly for stealing sensitive user data and exfiltrating it to a remote server. It employs obfuscation, process termination, and persistent installation techniques. It should be considered extremely dangerous and should not be used or deployed in any environment. The overall security risk score is high, with a malware score indicating a strong likelihood of malicious intent.",
