{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and other data from web browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It also collects system information and uploads the stolen data to remote servers via webhooks and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Reads browser storage files (Logins, Cookies, Local State), Discord API endpoints, Steam files, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data to external webhooks and file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles). Executes system commands to kill processes and modify startup folder. Writes data to temporary files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, passwords, cookies from local files -> decrypts sensitive data -> formats and sends via webhook or file hosting URLs -> may kill browser processes before accessing files -> copies files to temp directory -> uploads data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple system process kills, dynamic process/thread management, forced installation of dependencies, copying of browser files without user consent, extensive use of regex for token extraction, and multiple obfuscated variables and functions. Also, inclusion of Discord token validation and token information gathering functions, which are typical in malicious stealers.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive collection of user data: tokens from browser logs, cookies, and Discord API, along with passwords from Chrome, and system info including IP geolocation. It employs process termination to ensure access to locked files, decrypts encrypted data with master keys, and uploads the data via webhook and anonymous file hosting. The code includes multiple threads for parallel processing, checks for tokens validity, and incorporates logic for hiding itself in startup folders, which indicates persistence tactics. The functions to gather and exfiltrate cookies, passwords, and tokens, combined with the active process management and use of obfuscated variable names, strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious credential stealer and system data exfiltration tool, designed to harvest user tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various applications and browsers, then send or upload this data to remote servers. Its behaviors such as process killing, self-replication in startup folders, dependency installation, and extensive data extraction indicate highly malicious activity.",
