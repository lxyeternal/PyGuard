{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, cookie, and file stealer, exfiltrating data via Discord webhook and anonymous hosting services. It installs itself in startup for persistence, terminates related processes, decrypts stored data, and employs threading and minimal obfuscation to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Browser data directories (Login Data, Cookies, Local State), log files, environment variables, user directories, and system logs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook, uploads to anonymous file hosting services, process termination commands, self-copying to startup folder, and decryption routines for stored credentials.",
  "flows": "Reads encrypted data from browser files and logs, decrypts using Windows API, extracts tokens/passwords/cookies, then exfiltrates via network requests and file uploads. It also copies itself to startup, kills related processes, and runs multiple threads for data collection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, self-copying to startup folder, process termination commands targeting security and wallet processes, minimal variable obfuscation, and extensive use of threading for stealth and efficiency.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive data theft, including decrypting stored browser credentials, harvesting tokens and cookies, and collecting files from user directories. It employs Windows API calls for decryption, self-installation for persistence, and process termination to disable security tools and related applications. Data is exfiltrated via a hardcoded Discord webhook and uploaded to anonymous file hosts. The code uses threading to optimize collection speed and minimal obfuscation, primarily through misleading variable names. These behaviors are characteristic of a highly malicious credential and data stealer designed for stealth and persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, exhibiting all hallmarks of a credential and data-stealing malware with persistence, stealth, and exfiltration capabilities. It actively decrypts and exfiltrates sensitive user data, terminates security-related processes, and copies itself to maintain persistence. The malware score is justified as 1, the obfuscation is minimal with a score around 0.3, and the overall security risk is maximal at 1.",
