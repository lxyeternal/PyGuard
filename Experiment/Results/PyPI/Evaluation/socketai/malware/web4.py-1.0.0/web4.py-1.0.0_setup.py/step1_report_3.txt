{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'web4.py' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info (os.name), importing modules ('setuptools', 'os'), reading encrypted Fernet key and ciphertext, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec', importing 'requests' and 'fernet', reading environment variables, and decrypting embedded ciphertext.",
  "flows": "Source: environment check and module imports -> Decryption of Fernet-encrypted code -> 'exec' executes decrypted code, potentially malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed via 'exec' during installation, presence of obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted string with suspicious-looking ciphertext and key, no clear purpose for decryption step outside malicious intent, minimal documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, upon installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes embedded code via 'exec'. The code is encrypted using Fernet with a hardcoded key, and the decrypted payload is not visible, raising suspicion of malicious activity such as executing hidden backdoors, malware, or malicious code during package installation. The encrypted payload could contain harmful code. The presence of obfuscated class and variable names and the execution of encrypted code are typical signs of malicious intent. The package's setup function specifies custom installation logic that could compromise systems upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: executing encrypted code during package setup, which could hide backdoors or malicious scripts. The design appears intentionally obfuscated, with encrypted payloads and no transparency. Given these factors, the package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
