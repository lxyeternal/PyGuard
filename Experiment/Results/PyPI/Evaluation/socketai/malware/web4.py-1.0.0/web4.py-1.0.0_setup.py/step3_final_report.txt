{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts an encrypted payload using Fernet during Windows installation and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Encrypted ciphertext and Fernet key, read during install on Windows.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code.",
  "flows": "On Windows, decrypts the hardcoded payload and executes it immediately.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload with hardcoded key, obfuscated class name and description, conditional execution only on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with Fernet and executes it via exec() during installation on Windows. The encrypted payload is not visible, indicating obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a common malicious pattern. The code imports requests and cryptography modules, which could be used maliciously. The obfuscated class name and description further suggest concealment. The pattern aligns with known malicious package behaviors, especially in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high malicious potential by decrypting and executing hidden code during install on Windows. The pattern is consistent with malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 1, high obfuscation, and security risk scores of 1. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
