{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'selleniumm' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing modules, reading environment variables (os.name), and decrypting/executing embedded code in the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() during installation, potential network requests via requests module if on Windows, usage of Fernet decryption which may involve secret keys.",
  "flows": "During install, if on Windows, the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it, potentially executing malicious code. This flow indicates possible malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed during setup, dynamic code execution via exec(), use of obscure class name, embedded cryptographic key, and decryption routine. The long description is nonsensical, possibly obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup but includes a custom install class that decrypts and executes code at install time on Windows. The decrypted code is not visible, raising suspicion of embedded malicious payload. Usage of Fernet encryption/decryption with a hardcoded key suggests an attempt to hide malicious code. The presence of network module 'requests' further increases concern, especially since code execution occurs after decryption. The long description is nonsensical, likely obfuscation or noise. Overall, the code shows signs of potential malicious intent due to dynamic code execution and encrypted payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to contain malicious behavior with encrypted payloads executed during installation, suggesting malicious intent. It may serve as a backdoor or malicious installer, especially given the obfuscation and dynamic execution. Caution is advised in using this package.",
