  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external dependencies are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The actual code matches the descriptions: all reports correctly identify the code as class definitions with no additional logic.\n- No issues or discrepancies in the code's content or structure.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as safe, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is just class definitions with no execution or data handling, the risk is minimal.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; no obfuscation detected.\n- The overall security risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious features. The uniformity and correctness of the reports support these scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.",
