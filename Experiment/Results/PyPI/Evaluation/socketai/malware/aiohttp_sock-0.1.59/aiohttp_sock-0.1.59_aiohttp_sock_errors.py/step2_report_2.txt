  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observation:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: pure class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n- The exception classes are standard practice for error handling in larger applications.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniformly consistent and reasonable. They do not overstate or understate the risk.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- The security risk score is 0, as expected.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The scores given are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No need to adjust the scores; they accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is standard, non-malicious exception class definitions.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are justified as 0, and the confidence as 1.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk beyond normal exception handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
