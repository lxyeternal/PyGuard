  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; all are class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data flow, as this is only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions without unusual patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from base exception classes. These are structured for specific SOCKS proxy and connection error handling. No input/output, network activity, or data processing is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. The code is clean, simple, and standard for exception handling definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It shows no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and standard for use as part of larger systems.",
