  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The classes inherit from standard Python exception classes, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and safe, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. This assessment is consistent with the code provided. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content. The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no executable logic, no data handling, and no network activity, the risk scores should remain at 0. Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, structural nature of the code.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report summaries:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
