{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no flows, data or control, between sources and sinks; this code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; exception class definitions follow standard Python patterns with no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes and contain no logic, data handling, or execution flow. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity is present. No external dependencies or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a typical, safe, structural component for a larger application.\n\nNo signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are detected. The classes are straightforward and serve as error types without any embedded malicious logic or harmful behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard for use in larger projects dealing with SOCKS proxy error handling.",
