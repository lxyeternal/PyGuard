  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that there are no issues, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or risky behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified unless evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is found, which there isn't.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is appropriate, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final Summary & My Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.** It does not pose any security threat or contain malicious behavior. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing evaluations.",
