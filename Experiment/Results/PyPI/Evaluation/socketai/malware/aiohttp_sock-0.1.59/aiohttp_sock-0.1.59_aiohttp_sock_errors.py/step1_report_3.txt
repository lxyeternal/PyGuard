{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that do not read input or data during execution; no input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; solely class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The classes serve as error indicators for SOCKS proxy handling, with clear inheritance hierarchies. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and appears to be for error handling structure only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, secure codebase intended for error handling.",
