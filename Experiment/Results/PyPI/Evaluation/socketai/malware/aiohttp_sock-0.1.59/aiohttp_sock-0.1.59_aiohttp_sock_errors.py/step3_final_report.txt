{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors, intended for error handling in network applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are static definitions without execution flow or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or network activity. The code is simple, static, and standard for error handling. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The exception classes are standard and do not contain malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
