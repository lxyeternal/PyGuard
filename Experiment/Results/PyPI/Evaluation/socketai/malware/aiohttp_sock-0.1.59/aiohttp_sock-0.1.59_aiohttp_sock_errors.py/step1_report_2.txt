{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors for use in a larger networking application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; these are class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception subclasses with no additional code, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a set of custom exception classes, inheriting from standard exception types. There are no functions, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no unusual code patterns are present. The classes serve as a structured way to handle specific error conditions in SOCKS proxy communication, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger networking library or application.",
