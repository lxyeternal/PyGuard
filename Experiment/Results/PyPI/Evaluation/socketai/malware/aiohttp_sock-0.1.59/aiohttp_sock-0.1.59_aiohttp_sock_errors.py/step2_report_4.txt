  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- The code is purely class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a set of straightforward exception class definitions.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code snippets.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The summaries are appropriate and do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The risk scores are also zero, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Justification for scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports or the code suggest any malicious activity or security risk, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they focus solely on the code's structure.\n- No need to challenge any claims, as they are accurate.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nThe overall assessment confirms that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent.",
