  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of standard class definitions for exceptions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy and authentication error handling, inheriting from built-in exception classes. It contains no data input, processing, or external communication. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. It appears to be a straightforward setup for exception handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
