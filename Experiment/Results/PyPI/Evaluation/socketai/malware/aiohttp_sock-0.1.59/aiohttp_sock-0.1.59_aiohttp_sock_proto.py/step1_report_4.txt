{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for establishing proxy connections (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) in asynchronous Python applications, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports for destination servers, proxy server address/port, and optional user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from socket communications (receiving data from proxies), address resolution, and user-provided credentials, which are used for authentication and network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, ports, credentials) through socket connection and address resolution, into authentication and proxy negotiation, leading to the establishment of a proxied connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to follow standard proxy communication protocols; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are observed. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. Error handling appears standard, with exceptions raised for various network and protocol issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes to manage SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously. It handles address resolution, socket management, and protocol-specific negotiation, including authentication. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage are evident. The structure adheres to expected proxy protocols. The only potential concern could be handling user credentials, but they are managed securely and used solely for authentication. There are no signs of malicious code or sabotage. The code appears to be legitimate and intended for proxy communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy clients with proper error handling and protocol management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
