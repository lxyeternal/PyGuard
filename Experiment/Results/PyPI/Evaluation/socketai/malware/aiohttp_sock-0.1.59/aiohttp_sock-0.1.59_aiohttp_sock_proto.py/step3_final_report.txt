  "purpose": "Implement SOCKS4/5 proxy client with async support, handling address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy and destination, user credentials, hostname resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations, data sent over the network, address resolution results.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) processed through address resolution and authentication functions, then sent via socket operations to establish proxy connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Protocol adherence appears correct.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation properly, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The credential handling is typical, and no data leakage or system compromise mechanisms are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
