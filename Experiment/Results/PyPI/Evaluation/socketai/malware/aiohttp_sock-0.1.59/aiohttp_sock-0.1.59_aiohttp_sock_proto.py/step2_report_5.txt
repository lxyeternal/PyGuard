  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers with proper async handling, error management, and protocol adherence. No malicious signals or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code handles untrusted input but is standard.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable. The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, reflecting the typical risks of handling untrusted data.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning matches the scores. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy code, handling address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, handling credentials and socket communication securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis and scores align; no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward, standard implementation with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero but low, which is appropriate given the code handles untrusted data (hostnames, credentials) but does so securely and in line with expected proxy client behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that these are safe, legitimate implementations of SOCKS proxies.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, due to handling untrusted input but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment aligns with the reports; the code is safe and standard.",
