{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, handling connection negotiation and data transmission.",
  "sources": "Reads include network addresses, ports, and data from socket operations, address resolution functions, and user credentials.",
  "sinks": "Sends network requests, authentication data, and connection commands over sockets; receives responses and data from sockets.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, credentials) flows through address resolution, authentication, and connection request functions, reaching socket send operations; responses from sockets are read and processed to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; error handling appears standard. No suspicious network domains or data leaks are evident; the code strictly handles SOCKS proxy connection logic. No signs of backdoors, system info exfiltration, or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client functionality, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with authentication. It performs address resolution, constructs appropriate protocol requests, and handles server responses. All operations are typical for a proxy client, and there are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code does not include any network calls to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The structure and flow are consistent with legitimate proxy communication code, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation without malicious behavior or sabotage elements. It performs expected network operations for proxy negotiation and data transmission, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leakage. Overall, it is a standard, secure network utility code.",
