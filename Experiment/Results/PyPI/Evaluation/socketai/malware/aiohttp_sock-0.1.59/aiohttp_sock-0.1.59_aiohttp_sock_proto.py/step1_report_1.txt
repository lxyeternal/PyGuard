{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, enabling connections through proxies with support for various authentication methods and address types.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the network via self._loop.sock_recv, socket resolution via self._resolve_addr, and input data through function parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets via self._loop.sock_sendall and self._socket; socket connections are established with sock_connect. Internal address and protocol handling could process untrusted data if malformed, but the code properly handles exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and request construction, which are then sent via socket connections. Responses from proxy servers are read and parsed to determine connection success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code uses standard libraries and well-defined protocol structures. Exception handling seems appropriate. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to perform expected proxy negotiation functions without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers with proper asynchronous socket handling, including address resolution, protocol-specific negotiation, and error handling. It correctly interprets protocol responses and raises exceptions on errors. There are no signs of malicious modifications, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs, nor does it perform any unauthorized system actions. The security model relies on external inputs for hostnames and credentials, but these are typical and handled safely. Overall, the code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy communication with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It adheres to expected protocols and performs secure socket communication with proper error handling. There are no malicious signals, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. Therefore, it can be considered safe within the scope of its functionality.",
