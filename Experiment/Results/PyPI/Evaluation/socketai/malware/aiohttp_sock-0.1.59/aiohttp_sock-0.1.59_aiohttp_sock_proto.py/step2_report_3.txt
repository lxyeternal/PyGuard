  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS4/SOCKS5 implementation with proper error handling, no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code appears standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SOCKS proxy functionality, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical proxy client with no signs of malicious activity. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious signals.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward SOCKS proxy classes, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious features.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but low, consistent with the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, justified by the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**In summary:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
