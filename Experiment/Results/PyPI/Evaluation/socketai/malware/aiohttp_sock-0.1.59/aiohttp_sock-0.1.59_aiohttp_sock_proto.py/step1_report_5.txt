{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous socket wrapper classes for connecting through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "User input includes host, port, username, password, and connection parameters; data read occurs during socket communication (_receive, _resolve_addr); address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over sockets (_send), resolving addresses, establishing proxy connections (_connect, _socks_connect, _socks_auth), and reading socket responses (_receive).",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication procedures; socket data is sent (_send) and received (_receive); address info is resolved and used for connecting via proxy; proxy negotiation flows from connect to address request and response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code implements standard proxy negotiation procedures. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. Exception handling is appropriate. No suspicious network behavior or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy client classes with proper asynchronous socket handling. It performs address resolution, proxy negotiation, and socket communication without any hidden or malicious behavior. No suspicious data handling, no external network connections beyond intended proxy communication, and no data exfiltration or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, and the functions perform standard operations aligned with proxy protocols. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based applications, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It correctly handles socket communication, proxy negotiation, and address resolution, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
