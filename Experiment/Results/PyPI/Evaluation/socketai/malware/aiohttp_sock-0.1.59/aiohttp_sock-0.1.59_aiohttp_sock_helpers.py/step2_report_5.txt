  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio.\n- It parses proxy URLs, manages socket creation, and connects to target hosts via proxies.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The functions accept user-controlled inputs, which is typical for proxy utilities, but could be misused if inputs are malicious.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard proxy connection setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; inputs influence network behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment states the code is safe, with a high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scoring appears appropriate. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; emphasizes user-controlled inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that untrusted data influences connection parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report recognizes that untrusted inputs influence network behavior but finds no malicious intent. The confidence is high (0.9). The securityRisk score (0.3) is slightly higher than Report 1, which is reasonable given the potential for misuse of user inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; includes proxy URL parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies influence of untrusted inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes standard implementation, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9). Security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the possibility of misuse via user inputs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes untrusted data influences socket creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, low security risk, high confidence (0.9). The securityRisk score (0.2) is suitable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-aligned.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code's standard nature, no malicious behavior, minimal security risk, high confidence. Scores are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.3), reflecting the potential misuse of user-controlled inputs but no inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — considering that untrusted inputs influence network behavior, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation for SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio. The scores assigned across reports accurately reflect the code's behavior and potential risks.",
