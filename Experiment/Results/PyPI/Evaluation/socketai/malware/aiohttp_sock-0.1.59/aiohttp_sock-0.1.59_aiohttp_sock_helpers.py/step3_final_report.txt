{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to establish SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, parsing proxy URLs, handling credentials, creating socket wrappers, and connecting to target hosts.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, credentials (username/password), and untrusted input from user-supplied URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections to target hosts via proxies, potentially influenced by untrusted input affecting connection parameters.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing → socket wrapper creation → connection establishment → data flow through socket to target host.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asyncio-based SOCKS proxy connection functions with proper validation and error handling. It accepts untrusted inputs but does so in a typical manner for proxy utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code is clear, straightforward, and relies on well-known libraries. The potential for misuse exists if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to proxy connection code and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate given the handling of untrusted inputs, which is typical for such utilities.",
