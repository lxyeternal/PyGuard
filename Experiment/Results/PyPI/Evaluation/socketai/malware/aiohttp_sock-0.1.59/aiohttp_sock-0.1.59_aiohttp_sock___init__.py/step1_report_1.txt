{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that implements SOCKS proxy functionalities, including connectors, error handling, and connection helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; code mainly consists of imports and module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components related to proxy connections and errors, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. The structure indicates a typical package module for exporting functionalities. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It solely manages imports and exports, with no data leaks or malicious activities detected.",
