  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Overview:**\n   - The code is a typical Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, which imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, `.helpers`, `.proto`) and defines the module's public API via `__all__`.\n   - It also sets a version string `__version__ = \"0.1.2\"`.\n\n2. **Purpose and Functionality:**\n   - The code's purpose is to serve as an entry point or interface for a SOCKS proxy library, exposing relevant classes and functions for external use.\n   - There are no network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution within this snippet.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n3. **Security and Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.\n   - The code appears to be a standard module initializer, with no embedded or hidden malicious logic.\n\n4. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that this code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - They assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, the code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the comprehensive analysis in the reports, there are no grounds to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final Expert Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no malicious logic, no obfuscation, and poses no security risk based on the provided snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.",
