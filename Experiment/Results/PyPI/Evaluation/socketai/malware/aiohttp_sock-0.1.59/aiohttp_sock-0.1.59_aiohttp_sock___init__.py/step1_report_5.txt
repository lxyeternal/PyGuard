{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index or initialization module for a Python package related to proxy connections, importing various components and defining public API elements.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing, network communication, or untrusted data handling within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Imports are simply references to functions and classes; no data flows or untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily an import and export interface for package components. It imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules and defines the public API via __all__. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling processes present. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a simple package initializer with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It merely re-exports classes and functions from internal modules. No security concerns or malware indicators are present in this code snippet.",
