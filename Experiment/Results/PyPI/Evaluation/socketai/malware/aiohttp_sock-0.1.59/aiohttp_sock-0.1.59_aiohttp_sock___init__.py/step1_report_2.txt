  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to a proxy connection library, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; imports modules and defines exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports modules and re-exports symbols; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The version number is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from internal modules and makes them available for external use. It sets the version and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution present. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as a module aggregator.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks in this code. It functions as a standard package initializer or module aggregator.",
