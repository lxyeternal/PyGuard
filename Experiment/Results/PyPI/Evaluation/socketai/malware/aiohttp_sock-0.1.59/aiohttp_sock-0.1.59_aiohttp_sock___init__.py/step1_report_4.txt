{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module that imports various classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connection handling, specifically SOCKS proxies, and defines module metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the assignment of __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data are present in this fragment; it mainly contains imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to sensitive sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; the code is standard for a module's __init__.py or setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, sets version info, and defines an exported interface (__all__). There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or network operations. It appears to be a standard package setup or entry point file, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization script that sets up imports and exports. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks based on the provided content.",
