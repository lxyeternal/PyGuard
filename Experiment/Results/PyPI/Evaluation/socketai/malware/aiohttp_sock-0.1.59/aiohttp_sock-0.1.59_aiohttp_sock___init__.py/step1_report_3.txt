{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API and import dependencies for a proxy handling library, setting up module exports and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code mainly imports and exports symbols",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static, no runtime data processing shown",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining module metadata, and an __all__ list for public symbols. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. There are no apparent source-to-sink flows, nor any anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script setting up exports and versioning. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The package appears safe based on this snippet.",
