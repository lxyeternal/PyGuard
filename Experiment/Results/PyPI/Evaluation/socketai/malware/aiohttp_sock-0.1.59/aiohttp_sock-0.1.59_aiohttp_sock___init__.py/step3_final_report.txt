{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), setting __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; primarily import and export of components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup, importing classes and functions, setting a version, and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
