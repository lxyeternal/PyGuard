  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting various proxy types, custom DNS resolution, and URL parsing.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- External helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are assumed to be standard; their internal behavior isn't provided, but their usage seems typical.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The socket creation and connection handling follow expected patterns for proxy support.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages proxy setup securely, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the functionality, and malware is correctly scored as 0. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy resolution and socket management, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning matches the code. The scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the NoResolver class and proxy configuration, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe zero risk score is appropriate, as no risky behaviors are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes secure proxy handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent with the code. The risk score remains low, justified by the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0.2, except one report (Report 4) which assigns 0. The code does not perform any risky operations, so 0.2 seems appropriate as a conservative estimate.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to potential misuse if helper functions are malicious, but no evidence here)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy connector implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk score could be slightly lower than 0.2 if we assume helper functions are trustworthy, but 0.2 remains reasonable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll scores are consistent with the code's analysis.
