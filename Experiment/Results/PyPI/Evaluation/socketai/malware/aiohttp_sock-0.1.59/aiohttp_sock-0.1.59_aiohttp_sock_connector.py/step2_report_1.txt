  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code implements custom proxy resolution and connection management for aiohttp.\n   - It supports different proxy types, optional DNS resolution skipping, and dynamic proxy URL construction.\n   - Socket creation is handled via an external helper (`create_socket_wrapper`), and proxy URL parsing via `parse_proxy_url`.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code relies on standard patterns for proxy handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - Proxy credentials are passed via parameters and included in URL construction, which could be logged or exposed if not handled carefully elsewhere.\n   - The `create_socket_wrapper` function's implementation isn't provided; if malicious, it could introduce risks, but based on context, it appears to be a standard socket wrapper.\n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation.\n   - The code does not perform any unsafe operations beyond normal proxy setup.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Generally low (~0.2), reflecting potential issues with credential handling or external helper functions but not indicating active vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Critical Observations:**\n   - The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for proxy support.\n   - No evidence suggests the code is malicious or intentionally insecure.\n   - The reliance on external helpers warrants caution, but no suspicious behavior is inferred.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to external dependencies and credential handling considerations)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code is a standard, secure implementation of proxy connection management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security flaws are evident. The minor risk score reflects typical concerns with credential handling and external helper functions, not active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No signs of malicious code or activity                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation                            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2               | Slight concern over credential handling and external helpers       |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of any specific aspect.",
