{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with dependencies and then executes obfuscated scripts via encoded files, potentially to run malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (USERPROFILE), reads files ('__init__.py', 'README.md', obfuscated encoded scripts), executes external scripts and installs dependencies via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.call to install packages; writes obfuscated code to files; executes scripts with Popen, including a Visual Basic script (main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs) that is run via shell, potentially to execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable/env data → encoded base64 scripts written to files → script execution (VBScript) → potential malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded scripts, writing potentially malicious scripts ('main.cpython-39.pyw' and VBScript 'main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs') with encoded content, running external scripts without clear purpose, and installing dependencies dynamically. The presence of heavily obfuscated code and script execution points to suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package, installs multiple dependencies via subprocess, and writes obfuscated base64-encoded scripts into files. These scripts are then executed, including a VBScript, which may be used to perform malicious activities such as persistence, payload execution, or system compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic script execution strongly suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, especially since the code does not reveal explicit benign functionality. The reliance on base64-encoded payloads and external script execution is a common tactic in malware supply chains.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, mainly due to encoded payloads, dynamic execution of scripts, and obfuscated code content. These actions are typical of malware or backdoor installers. Caution is advised, and the package should not be used in production environments without further in-depth analysis.",
