  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious indicators: obfuscated remote code execution triggered conditionally, referencing suspicious domains, with silent error handling. The high obfuscation and execution of potentially harmful commands justify high malware and security risk scores. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised."
