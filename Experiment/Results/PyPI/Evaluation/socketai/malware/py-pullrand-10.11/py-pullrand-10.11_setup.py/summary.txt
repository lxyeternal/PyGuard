  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, remote-executable PowerShell command triggered conditionally and silently. While the package setup appears legitimate, the embedded payload poses a significant security threat. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants classifying this as highly malicious."
