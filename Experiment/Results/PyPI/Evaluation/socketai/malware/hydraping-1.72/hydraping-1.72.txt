      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, which strongly indicates malicious activity or a backdoor. The pattern of obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression warrants high security concern. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Until then, this package should be treated as potentially malicious or compromised."
