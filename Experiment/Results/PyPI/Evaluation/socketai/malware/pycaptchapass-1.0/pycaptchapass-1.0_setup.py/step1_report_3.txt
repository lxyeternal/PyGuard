  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'pycaptchapass' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements; the temporary file creation and write; system call; setup function parameters.",
  "sinks": "System call executing external file; remote URL fetch and execution; package setup process.",
  "flows": "Temporary file writes code that fetches and executes remote content → system call runs the file → code executes external code from URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code creates a temporary file that downloads and executes remote code without any validation; uses _system with 'start' on Windows to run the file asynchronously; no validation or sanitization of remote content.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for setup, temporary files, system execution, and executable path. It creates a temporary file containing code that fetches and executes content from a remote URL, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. The temporary file is then run asynchronously using a system call, possibly to hide or delay malicious actions. The setup() function appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious behavior of remote code execution. Overall, the code's primary function is to download and run external malicious code stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that downloads and executes remote code, representing a significant security risk. It appears designed to silently fetch and run external code, likely for malicious purposes.",
