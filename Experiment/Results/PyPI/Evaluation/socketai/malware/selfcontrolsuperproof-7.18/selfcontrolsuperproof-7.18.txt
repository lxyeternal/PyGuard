      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with obfuscated PowerShell commands executed during setup, connecting to a suspicious domain. The behavior aligns with supply chain malware tactics. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious until further analysis confirms benign intent."
