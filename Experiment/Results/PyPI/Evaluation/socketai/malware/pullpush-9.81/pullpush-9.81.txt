      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The silent error handling and obfuscation are typical of malicious payloads designed to evade detection. Without decoding the command, definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the risk is substantial. The current assessment and scores are appropriate, and further decoding of the command is recommended to clarify intent."
