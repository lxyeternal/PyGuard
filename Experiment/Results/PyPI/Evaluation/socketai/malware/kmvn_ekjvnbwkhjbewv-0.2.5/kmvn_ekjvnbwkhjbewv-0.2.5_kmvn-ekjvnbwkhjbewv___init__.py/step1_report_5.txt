  "purpose": "Collect system metrics and send them to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), os.getlogin()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits collected data over the network to an external server",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are concatenated into URL parameters, then sent via requests.get() to the external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious domain (non-standard, long, random-looking URL); no validation or encryption of data; no checks for the safety or legitimacy of the target URL",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as OS details, current working directory, hostname, and login name. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and makes an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain. This pattern indicates data exfiltration or tracking behavior. The domain appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is common in malicious or tracking scripts. The code does not perform any validation or error handling, further suggesting malicious intent. There are no other malicious payloads or backdoors present, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system information to an external server without any validation or encryption, indicating potential malicious behavior and privacy violation. The URL domain appears suspicious and likely used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
