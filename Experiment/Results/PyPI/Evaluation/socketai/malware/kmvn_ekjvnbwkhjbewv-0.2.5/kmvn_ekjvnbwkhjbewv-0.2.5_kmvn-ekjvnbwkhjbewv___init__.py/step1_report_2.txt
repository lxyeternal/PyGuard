  "purpose": "Collect system metrics and send them to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), and os.getlogin().",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.get() to a remote URL with embedded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (osname_str, cwd, hostname, login) -> URL parameters in requests.get() -> remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious, non-descriptive URL (likely malicious or command-and-control server), sending system info without user consent, and no validation or encryption of data. The domain looks unusual and possibly malicious. No authentication or encryption observed.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system information: OS name and release, current working directory, hostname, and username. It then constructs a GET request to a suspicious-looking domain, embedding this info as URL parameters. The URL is non-standard and could be used for malicious command-and-control or data exfiltration. The code lacks any form of user consent, encryption, or validation, raising security concerns. No malicious code execution or backdoors are evident, but the behavior suggests potential malicious intent due to data exfiltration to an untrusted domain.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information to an unknown remote server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It does not implement security best practices such as encryption or validation, and the domain is unusual. Overall, this is a security concern and warrants further investigation.",
