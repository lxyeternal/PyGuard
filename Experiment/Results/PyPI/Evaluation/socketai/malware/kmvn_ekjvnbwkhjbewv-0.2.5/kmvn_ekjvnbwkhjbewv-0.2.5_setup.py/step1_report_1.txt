  "purpose": "Set up script for a Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, setting package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> assigning variables -> setup() function call with package info.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears random or obfuscated ('kmvn_ekjvnbwkhjbewv'), but no malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README file for description, defines version and description variables, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The package name appears non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated, but this alone is not suspicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The dependencies are standard ('requests'). No signs of malware or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with an unusual package name but no malicious content. No security risks identified.",
