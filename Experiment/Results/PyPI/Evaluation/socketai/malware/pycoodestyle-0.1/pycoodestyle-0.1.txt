      "conclusion": "The primary concern is the code in Report 1, which exhibits obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, suggesting moderate malicious potential. The other reports are benign or empty. Slightly elevating the malware score for Report 1 to 0.5 and the security risk to 0.65 aligns with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate."
