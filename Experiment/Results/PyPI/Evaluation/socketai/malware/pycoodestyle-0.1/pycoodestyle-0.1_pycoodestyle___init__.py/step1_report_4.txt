{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a template or skeleton for a Python script, possibly intended for package setup or basic scripting tasks.",
  "sources": "Data sources include standard input, environment variables, and possibly external modules imported at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network communications, or execution of dynamic code if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are identified due to the lack of detailed code or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly empty or contains minimal boilerplate; there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs present. The structure suggests a template rather than functional code.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment appears to be empty or a placeholder with no operational logic, inputs, or outputs. Without specific functional code, it does not demonstrate any malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or security risks. The absence of operational code also means there are no source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is essentially a blank or placeholder script with no functional or malicious intent.",
