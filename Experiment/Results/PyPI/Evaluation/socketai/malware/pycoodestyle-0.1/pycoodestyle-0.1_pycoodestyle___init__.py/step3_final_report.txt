  "purpose": "Analysis of suspicious or benign Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points, data input functions, network interactions, imported modules, environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to potential malicious sinks via control flow paths, especially through dynamic execution or obfuscated code segments.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution signs, suspicious imports, hardcoded strings, unusual control flow, placeholders with no logic.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates obfuscated code with signs of dynamic execution and complex data flows, leading to moderate suspicion (malware score 0.5, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.65). Other reports lack code or contain benign placeholders, with zero scores. The suspicion in Report 1 is justified by the described obfuscation and dynamic behavior, warranting cautious monitoring. Slightly increasing malware suspicion from 0.4 to 0.5 better reflects the potential threat without overestimating. The other reports are correctly scored as benign.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the code in Report 1, which exhibits obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, suggesting moderate malicious potential. The other reports are benign or empty. Slightly elevating the malware score for Report 1 to 0.5 and the security risk to 0.65 aligns with the evidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
