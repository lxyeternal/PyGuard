      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, with high likelihood of malicious intent. The silent, hidden execution and obfuscation justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads, but current evidence suggests a significant security concern."
