  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell commands executed during setup, with silent error handling and suspicious URL comments. These are strong indicators of malicious activity, likely aimed at remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package should be flagged for review and not deployed without further analysis."
