  "purpose": "The script is used to package and distribute a Python library called 'forecolors7', including reading version information and metadata for setup.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem: 'forecolors7/__init__.py', 'README.rst' for version info and long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from a file; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, defines functions to read files and extract version info, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input are present. The code is typical for a Python package setup script and contains no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs no malicious actions, contains no suspicious behaviors, and appears safe. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
