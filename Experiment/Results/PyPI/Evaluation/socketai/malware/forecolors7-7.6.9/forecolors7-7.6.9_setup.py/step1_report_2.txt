{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'forecolors7' by reading package information and configuring the build process.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as '__init__.py' for version info and 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or external system interactions beyond standard file reads.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from package file, uses it in setup; reads description file for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations: reading files, extracting version info with regex, and configuring package metadata. No user input, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is well-structured and functions as expected for package configuration.",
