  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling untrusted input, are identified.\n- The code is straightforward: reading files, extracting version info with regex, and calling setup().\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the use of `from __future__ import with_statement`, which is outdated but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. All reports confirm the code performs typical setup tasks with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is standard, with correct logic for version extraction and setup configuration.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - *Malware:* 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - *Obfuscated:* 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n  - *SecurityRisk:* Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which is negligible and likely due to the outdated import statement.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Code:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The scores are all very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable. The one report's 0.1 is just a minor concern over the outdated import statement, not a security risk.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The report with a securityRisk of 0.1 might overstate the concern over the `from __future__ import with_statement`. While outdated, this is not a security vulnerability. Therefore, a risk score of 0.0 would be more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 to reflect negligible concern over outdated import, but 0 is preferable)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.**\n- **No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.**\n- **The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with minor room for adjustment in the risk score.**\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set the overall security risk score to 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that version extraction regex is safe; in this case, it is straightforward and correct.",
