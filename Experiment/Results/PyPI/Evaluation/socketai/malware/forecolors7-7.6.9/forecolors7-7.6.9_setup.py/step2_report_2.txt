  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across the reports.\n- The code performs file reads, regex extraction of version info, and calls setup() with package metadata—typical and safe operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The only minor point is the outdated import of `with_statement` for Python 2.7+, but this is not malicious, just deprecated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code reads version info from `__init__.py` using regex, which is correct and safe.\n- **No malicious code:** No network, no dynamic code execution, no untrusted data processing.\n- **No obfuscation:** All code is straightforward.\n- **No data leaks or external data sinks.**\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The use of `from __future__ import with_statement` is outdated for Python 2.7+, but not malicious.\n- The regex for version extraction is simple and safe.\n- No other flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup, no security risk.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports assign a **securityRisk** of 0.1 in one case, which seems slightly high given the benign nature of the code. It should be 0.\n- All reports have a confidence of 1, which is justified.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The minor outdated import statement does not affect security.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores or conclusions. The code is benign.",
