  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that executes during import, representing a severe security threat. The embedded payload performs remote code execution and network activity, justifying maximum malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The rest of the code appears benign, but the embedded malicious payload makes the overall package highly dangerous."
