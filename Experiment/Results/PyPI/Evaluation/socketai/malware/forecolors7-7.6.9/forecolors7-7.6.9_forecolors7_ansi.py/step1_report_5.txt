{
  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining ANSI color codes, environment variables for runtime configurations, base64-decoded embedded code in 'AnsiCodes' class.",
  "sinks": "Output functions generating escape sequences; potential execution of embedded code via 'exec' and 'compile' in 'AnsiCodes' class.",
  "flows": "Constant definitions and 'AnsiCodes' class initialization lead to generation of escape sequences; embedded base64-decoded code executed during module import, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of embedded base64-encoded code decoded and executed at import time; this is unusual for a terminal formatting module. The code within the base64 appears to import modules, perform network requests, and manipulate system or environment states.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and classes to produce ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. However, a notable anomaly is the embedded base64-encoded string that, when decoded, is compiled and executed dynamically. This embedded code imports system modules, makes network requests to a specific URL, and executes code from the internet, indicating malicious behavior such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. This embedded code is executed immediately upon module import, posing a significant security threat. All other parts of the code are standard and typical for a terminal styling library, but the embedded payload elevates the risk considerably.",
  "conclusion": "The core ANSI styling code is benign and standard. However, the presence of embedded, dynamically executed malicious code constitutes a serious security threat. This module is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious due to its embedded remote code execution payload.",
