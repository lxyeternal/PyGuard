  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and cursor control.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded ANSI code constants within classes, inline string literals, base64-encoded and dynamically executed code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded and compiled code using exec and compile functions, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded string is compiled and executed, potentially executing malicious code; other flows are straightforward ANSI code generation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded string that is decoded, compiled, and executed dynamically. No other suspicious inputs or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and functions for ANSI terminal control, which is standard. However, there is a suspicious segment where a base64-encoded string is decoded, compiled, and executed dynamically using exec. This pattern is commonly used to obfuscate malicious code or include hidden payloads. Aside from this, the rest of the code is normal for terminal formatting libraries. The dynamic execution is the key anomaly, indicating possible malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code mostly implements standard ANSI terminal formatting functions, but the embedded base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed at runtime is suspicious and likely malicious. This suggests the package may include hidden or malicious functionality. Caution is advised before using this code.",
