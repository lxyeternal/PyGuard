  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (e.g., 'title', 'x', 'y', 'n') and class attributes for ANSI codes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'exec' call with decoded base64 code, which executes arbitrary code during import.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and passed directly to 'exec', executing embedded code that makes network requests and system calls.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a large base64-encoded string decoded and executed immediately during module import is highly unusual and suspicious. The code contains dynamic execution of obfuscated payloads involving network and system modules.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard ANSI styling utility with classes for colors, styles, and cursor control. However, embedded within is a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, executes code involving network requests, temporary files, and subprocess calls. This payload is decoded and executed at import time, indicating malicious intent. The embedded code's behavior suggests remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionality. The high obfuscation level (base64 encoding and dynamic 'exec') and the malicious payload's nature justify high malware and security risk scores. The rest of the code is benign and standard for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that executes during import, representing a severe security threat. The embedded payload performs remote code execution and network activity, justifying maximum malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The rest of the code appears benign, but the embedded malicious payload makes the overall package highly dangerous.",
