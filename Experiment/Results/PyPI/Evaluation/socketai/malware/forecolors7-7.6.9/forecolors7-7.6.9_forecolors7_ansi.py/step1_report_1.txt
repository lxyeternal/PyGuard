  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output, cursor movement, and style modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from internal class attributes and method parameters; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the return values of functions that generate escape sequences, which could be used to manipulate terminal display; no other data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions through method calls that generate escape sequences; there are no untrusted input sources feeding into these functions that could lead to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a block where a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed via 'exec'. This is a significant anomaly, as it introduces arbitrary code execution from an encoded string, which could be malicious if the encoded content is malicious. The presence of 'exec' with dynamically decoded code is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of definitions for ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output, cursor movement, and color settings. The class attributes are standard color and style codes. The functions generate escape sequences for terminal control. The anomalous part is a block where a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed using 'exec', which could be used to run arbitrary code at runtime, representing a potential backdoor or malicious payload. This code is embedded directly within the module, executed upon import, without any clear benign purpose. The rest of the code appears standard and benign, serving as a terminal styling utility. The embedded 'exec' with decoded base64 content is the primary concern and indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Most of the code appears to be standard ANSI styling utilities, but a significant malicious anomaly exists where a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed immediately during import. This indicates the package contains an embedded backdoor or malicious code intended to execute arbitrary code at runtime. Due to this, the overall risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
