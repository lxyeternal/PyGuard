{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate and test the handling of ANSI color codes in stdout and stderr, ensuring redirection does not affect stdout output.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses internal imports and print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements send output to stdout and stderr, but do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; outputs are static strings with color codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard libraries and straightforward print statements without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colorama for cross-platform ANSI support, and prints colored text to stdout and stderr. It tests that stderr redirection does not affect stdout. No external input, no data processing, no potential data leakage or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of color output handling and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
