{
  "purpose": "The code initializes color support for terminal output and demonstrates colored output on stdout and stderr.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, fixpath, and colorama; reads sys.stderr and sys.stdout for output streams.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.stderr and sys.stdout using print statements with colorama formatting.",
  "flows": "Input data is standard output and error streams; flow is primarily display formatting, no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of colorama is standard for colored output.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes colorama, and prints colored text to stdout and stderr. It verifies that colored output to stderr does not affect stdout. The code is straightforward and intended for display purposes. No suspicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is detected. No data leaks, code injection points, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of colored terminal output using colorama. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns identified.",
