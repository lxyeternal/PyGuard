  "purpose": "Adjust the system path to prioritize local source code for the 'colorama' module.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory (__file__), constructs a path to the parent directory, and modifies sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path, which affects module import behavior; no direct data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification allows subsequent imports to prioritize local modules over installed ones.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code simply manipulates sys.path for import resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the environment so that the local version of 'colorama' is imported before any installed version, which is a common development pattern. It uses standard libraries (sys, os.path) and straightforward path operations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated components. It is a benign setup snippet intended for development convenience.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module import setup, with no indications of malicious intent. It adjusts the module search path for local development, which is a common and safe practice.",
