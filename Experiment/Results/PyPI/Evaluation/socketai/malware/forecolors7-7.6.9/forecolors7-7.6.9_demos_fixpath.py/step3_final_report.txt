  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' module by inserting its parent directory at the start of sys.path.",
  "sources": "__file__ variable to determine current script's directory, os.path functions to compute parent directory",

  "flows": "__file__ -> os.path.dirname(__file__) -> os.path.join(...) -> sys.path.insert(0, ...)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward path manipulation without obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to determine the script's directory and its parent, then inserts this directory at the beginning of sys.path to ensure local module import precedence. It is a common pattern in development environments. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is transparent and performs a benign setup task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard development pattern for controlling module import order. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
