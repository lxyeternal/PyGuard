  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python import path to prioritize local source code for the 'colorama' module.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file location (__file__) and manipulates sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path to influence module import behavior.",
  "flows": "From __file__ to sys.path.insert(0, ...), affecting module import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code adjusts sys.path by inserting the parent directory of the current script to the front of the import search path. This ensures that local source code of 'colorama' is used over any installed version. The operations involve standard library functions and straightforward path manipulations, with no obfuscated code, external network activity, or data exfiltration. The intent appears to be to control module loading order for development or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to prioritize local module loading. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
