{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates terminal cursor movement using colorama library functions for visual terminal effects.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input, data, or environment variables; uses internal function calls for cursor control sequences.",
  "sinks": "Print statements with cursor movement sequences; no untrusted data or external communication involved.",
  "flows": "Code executes cursor movement functions (up, down, forward, back) followed by print statements, affecting terminal display but not data flow outside the terminal context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama, initializes it, and performs cursor movements combined with print statements to produce a visual effect. It does not process untrusted input, perform network or file operations, or contain malicious payloads. The cursor control sequences are standard for terminal UI demonstrations. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless demonstration of terminal cursor control with no malicious or security concerns. It poses no threat and is appropriate for use as a visual terminal effect script.",
