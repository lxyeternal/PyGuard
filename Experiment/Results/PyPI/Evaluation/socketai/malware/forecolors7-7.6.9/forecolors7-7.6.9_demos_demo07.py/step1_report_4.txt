{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only internal code and library functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output ANSI escape sequences for cursor movement; no data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; cursor movement sequences are generated internally and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of colorama cursor functions is for demonstration purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama and uses its cursor movement functions to perform terminal cursor manipulations. It initializes colorama, then prints multiple lines, and issues escape sequences to move the cursor relative to its current position. The sequences are used to produce a visual demonstration of cursor control, not to perform malicious actions. There are no input data sources, network activities, or obfuscated segments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor movement with the colorama library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
