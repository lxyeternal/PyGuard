  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library for terminal cursor control.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath, colorama; calls to colorama.init() and colorama.Cursor movement functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output terminal control sequences for cursor movement.",
  "flows": "Initialization via colorama.init() -> Cursor movement commands -> print outputs that include control sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of cursor movement sequences is typical for terminal display control.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, particularly colorama for terminal cursor control. It defines a main function that initializes colorama and prints multiple lines. It then uses colorama's cursor movement sequences to manipulate the terminal cursor position before printing additional characters. The control sequences are used to produce a specific output pattern. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of terminal cursor movements with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data leaks, external connections, or obfuscated code are present. The intent seems to be visual terminal output manipulation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of cursor movement in the terminal using colorama. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a harmless display script.",
