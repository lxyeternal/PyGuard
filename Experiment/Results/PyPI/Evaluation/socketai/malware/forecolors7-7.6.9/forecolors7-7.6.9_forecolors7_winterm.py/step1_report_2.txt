{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for manipulating Windows console properties such as colors, styles, cursor position, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Reads console buffer info via win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, win32.GetConsoleTitle, and win32.SetConsoleTitle. Uses win32 constants for handle identification.",
  "sinks": "Calls to win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition, win32.FillConsoleOutputCharacter, win32.FillConsoleOutputAttribute, win32.SetConsoleTitle.",
  "flows": "Initialization retrieves default console attributes. Methods modify console properties or position based on inputs, such as color, style, or cursor movements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious network activity or system modifications. Code mainly manages console output; no external data flow or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for console colors, styles, and operations. It interacts with Windows API functions to control console appearance and cursor positioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data theft, or code injection. The functions strictly perform console manipulation tasks, and the API calls used are standard for terminal control. The code is well-structured and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Windows console utility module, providing color and cursor control functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified.",
