{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Windows console interface for manipulating text attributes, cursor position, screen clearing, and title setting, primarily for formatting console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads console buffer info via win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, retrieves cursor position, and takes input parameters for styling and positioning.",
  "sinks": "The code calls win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition, win32.FillConsoleOutputCharacter, win32.FillConsoleOutputAttribute, and win32.SetConsoleTitle, which are all standard Windows console API functions. No untrusted or external data is directly written or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (style, color, position, mode) influence console functions, with no external data flows or untrusted input leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code performs standard console manipulations without hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The only notable aspect is the extensive use of the win32 API for console control, which is legitimate for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Windows console control features using the win32 API. It manipulates console text attributes, cursor position, screen, and line clearing functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration. It does not include any obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The code is structured, clear, and consistent with typical console interface modules.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate Windows console utility class with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond normal console manipulation functions. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe to use.",
