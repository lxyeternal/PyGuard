  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages ANSI support on Windows via stream wrapping, using sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and atexit.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no credentials, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, safe, with high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard terminal handling utility, safe and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on wrapping stdout/stderr with AnsiToWin32, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior, standard ANSI support code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on stream wrapping, cleanup, and ANSI handling.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Same general purpose: wrapping stdout/stderr for ANSI sequences.\n- No malicious patterns, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, straightforward stream management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar purpose, no suspicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous, safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied but all very low (0.1-0.2), consistent with a benign utility.\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-understood pattern for managing console streams for ANSI support on Windows.\n- No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for utility code managing streams)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
