{
  "purpose": "This code manages the initialization, wrapping, and resetting of standard output and error streams, particularly for handling ANSI escape sequences on Windows.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.stdout and sys.stderr during init and reinit functions, and during stream wrapping.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to sys.stdout and sys.stderr during stream wrapping and resetting, but only for output formatting purposes.",
  "flows": "Input streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr) are wrapped with AnsiToWin32 for ANSI processing, then reset to original streams during deinit or reset_all.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code primarily manages stream handling with standard library functions and a third-party class, AnsiToWin32.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up and manages console stream wrappers for ANSI escape code processing. It registers cleanup functions with atexit, uses context managers, and reinitializes streams as needed. No data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious behavior is evident. The only third-party dependency is AnsiToWin32, which is used for ANSI handling; no malicious activity is associated with its usage here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is focused on stream management and ANSI escape sequence handling without any signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs standard output stream wrapping for formatting purposes. No security risks or malware behaviors detected.",
