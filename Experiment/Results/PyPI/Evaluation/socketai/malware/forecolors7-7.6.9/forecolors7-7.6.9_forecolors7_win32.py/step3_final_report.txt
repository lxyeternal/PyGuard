{
  "purpose": "This code provides wrappers around Windows API functions for console management, including retrieving console info, setting text attributes, cursor position, and console title.",
  "sources": "Functions like _GetStdHandle, _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, and _SetConsoleTitleW which read console handles, buffer info, and set console title respectively.",
  "sinks": "SetConsoleTitle, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, which can accept external input (e.g., title string) but are used here as standard API wrappers.",
  "flows": "External input (e.g., title string) flows into functions like SetConsoleTitle; console handle retrieval flows into buffer info and attribute functions; cursor position adjustments flow through coordinate calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Error handling is present. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of Windows console API wrappers. It conditionally imports DLLs, handles missing modules gracefully, and performs basic validation on parameters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Functions accept parameters that could influence console appearance but do not process untrusted input internally. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility library with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
