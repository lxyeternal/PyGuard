{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of functions for interacting with the Windows console, including retrieving console info, setting text attributes, cursor positions, filling output, and setting console titles.",
  "sources": "The code reads console handle information using Windows API functions such as GetStdHandle and GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo. It also reads environment and console state through these Windows API calls.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the console (e.g., SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, SetConsoleTitleW). These functions could be used maliciously if provided with untrusted input, but in the code as given, input parameters are controlled internally or are function arguments.",
  "flows": "Input (parameters for functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle) flows into Windows API functions that modify console state. The functions for getting console info are read-only and do not alter state.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes exception handling for Windows API import failures, and some functions adjust cursor positions with comments indicating offset adjustments. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are evident. The code relies on standard Windows API calls for console management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for Windows console manipulation using standard API calls. It includes safe handling for missing modules. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are directly processed in a malicious way. All functions serve legitimate purposes such as changing text color, cursor position, or window title. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility library for Windows console interaction. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard helper module, with no signs of malware or security risks in the provided fragment.",
