{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with Windows console API, including retrieving console info, setting text attributes, cursor position, output characters, and setting the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads include import statements, especially the ctypes library, and functions that retrieve console handle information and console buffer info.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console state, such as _SetConsoleTextAttribute, _SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, and SetConsoleTitleW.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions retrieving handle info to sinks that modify console display attributes or title; for example, GetStdHandle to SetConsoleTextAttribute or SetConsoleCursorPosition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Functions are standard Windows console API wrappers. The code includes conditional import handling and safe bounds checks before position adjustments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps Windows API calls for console manipulation, with careful handling of potential import errors. It adjusts cursor positions to account for Windows API's 0-based indexing and current viewport offsets. No obfuscated language features, malicious injections, or suspicious behavior are detected. All functions perform expected console API interactions with appropriate argument types. No data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Windows console interaction utility module. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign library for console manipulation with proper error handling and input validation.",
