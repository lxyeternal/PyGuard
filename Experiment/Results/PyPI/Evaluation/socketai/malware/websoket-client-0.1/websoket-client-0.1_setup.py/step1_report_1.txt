  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'websoket-client'.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, distutils.core, random; environment variables; os.getenv; os.makedirs; os.path functions; potentially external modules like pip, win32com, ctypes, os, and win32com.client Dispatch; complex obfuscated computations used for control flow and string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of pip.main() with dynamically constructed arguments; creation of shortcuts with CreateShortcut(); environment variable access via os.getenv; file operations with open(), write(), close(), Save(), and os.makedirs; potentially executing code or file manipulations based on dynamic conditions; use of Dispatch to get system info or perform admin checks; use of os.path functions for file system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input sources include sys.argv, environment variables, and os.path checks; flow to external modules like pip, win32com, ctypes, os for system modifications or executions; control flow dependent on obfuscated conditions; file and shortcut operations based on complex runtime checks and environment states.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through complex, nonsensical computations and string manipulations; dynamic attribute access with getattr() for string assembly; unusual variable names in non-meaningful characters; use of potentially malicious system calls such as Dispatch, os.getenv, os.makedirs, and dynamic file path manipulations; code that seems designed to execute or manipulate files and system shortcuts based on runtime conditions. Presence of conditional branches that may execute admin commands or system modifications; use of obscure number computations to control flow and logic, which could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initially performs complex, obfuscated calculations to determine control flow paths. It conditionally executes system modifications such as creating shortcuts, making directories, or accessing environment variables, often based on runtime checks and dynamic strings constructed from code obfuscation. It dynamically invokes pip to install or upgrade packages, potentially with malicious parameters. Multiple segments involve file handling and system calls, possibly to execute or modify system files or shortcuts. The presence of external modules like win32com and ctypes, along with system admin checks, indicates potential system manipulation capabilities. The code employs extensive obfuscation to hide its true purpose, which may include system tampering, malicious installations, or privacy breaches. The use of environment variables, system calls, and file manipulations under obfuscated control flow indicates a high risk for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation, employs system and environment manipulations, dynamically executes commands, and potentially modifies system files or installs packages without clear user consent. Given the complex, nonsensical computations and system interactions, there is a strong likelihood of malicious or sabotage intent. The code's obfuscation makes analysis difficult, but the underlying actions suggest possible malware behavior including system compromise, unauthorized package management, or system modifications.",
