{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Minimal or no explicit input/output points; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of untrusted data flow leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "No suspicious source-to-sink paths identified; code structure indicates benign data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, clear, and lacks suspicious features such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. Confidence levels vary based on code completeness, but overall, the code appears benign. No malicious or obfuscated signals are present, and security risks are minimal. The assessments across reports are consistent with the evidence, with scores appropriately reflecting the limited scope and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely to be benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Security risks are negligible, and the malware score should remain at 0. The assessments are consistent and justified given the limited information.",
