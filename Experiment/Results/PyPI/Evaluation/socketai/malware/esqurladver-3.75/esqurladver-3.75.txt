      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor activity. The high obfuscation and conditional execution, combined with the suspicious URL, justify a high malware and security risk score. Further analysis should decode the payload to confirm malicious behavior. Until then, the package should be considered potentially dangerous."
