      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, indicative of potentially malicious behavior. While the setup appears benign, the presence of such obfuscated, silently executed commands warrants high suspicion and caution. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity."
