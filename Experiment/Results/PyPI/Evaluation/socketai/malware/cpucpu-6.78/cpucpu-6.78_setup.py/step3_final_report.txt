{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'cpucpu' and conditionally executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during installation if the directory 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory and executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a hidden PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions such as system modification, data exfiltration, or persistence, depending on the payload.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, executes encoded PowerShell command -> command runs silently in background during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window flags; silent exception handling suppresses errors; obfuscation and covert execution during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup but includes a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command triggered during installation, which is executed silently and with error suppression. The encoded command's payload is unknown, but its obfuscation and background execution are red flags. The silent error handling could hide failures or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscated ~0.85, risk ~0.8) are justified given the indicators. Decoding the payload is necessary for definitive assessment, but current evidence suggests high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, indicative of potentially malicious behavior. While the setup appears benign, the presence of such obfuscated, silently executed commands warrants high suspicion and caution. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity.",
