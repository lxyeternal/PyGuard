{
  "purpose": "The script is primarily for setting up a Python package named 'cpucpu' with the specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.path.exists), system state (subprocess and os), and executes a subprocess command with encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could potentially be malicious if decoded and executed malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg', and if it doesn't exist, executes a hidden PowerShell command. The setup() function is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious; it appears to be base64-encoded, which is commonly used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The code attempts to execute this command without validation or transparency. No clear purpose for the command is provided.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils for package setup and conditionally executes a PowerShell command via subprocess with encoded content, possibly to perform malicious actions or establish persistence. The setup() call appears standard, with no obvious malicious parameters. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command is suspicious and warrants further decoding to assess its purpose. The code is minimal but contains obfuscated behavior, which raises concern. The setup process itself is benign, but the initial subprocess call introduces a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution that could be malicious. The setup procedure is standard, but the presence of the encoded PowerShell command suggests potential malicious intent or sabotage, possibly used for persistence, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The overall risk is moderate due to this suspicious behavior.",
