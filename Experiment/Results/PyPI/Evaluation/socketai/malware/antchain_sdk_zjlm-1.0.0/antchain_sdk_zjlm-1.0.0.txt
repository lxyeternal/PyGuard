      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The overall security risk is very high, warranting immediate concern and avoidance of this package."
