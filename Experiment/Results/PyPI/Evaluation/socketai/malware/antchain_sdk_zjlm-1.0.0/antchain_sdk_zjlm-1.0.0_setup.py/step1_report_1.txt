{
  "purpose": "The setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "Performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with collected system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits this data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hidden network request during installation that transmits system details to an external server without user consent. The request URL appears suspicious and intended for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and modules for gathering system info. It defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method to perform the default install and then sends system information via an HTTP GET request. The URL used for data transmission is hardcoded and points to an external server, suggesting possible data exfiltration. The data collected includes hostname, current directory, and username, which could be used for fingerprinting or malicious tracking. No other malicious actions, such as executing arbitrary code, modifying files, or establishing reverse shells, are present. The behavior appears to be an attempt at malicious data harvesting during package installation, which is a supply chain attack tactic.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py contains malicious behavior that exfiltrates system information during package installation to an external server, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The code is intentionally obfuscated in behavior, hidden behind a standard setup script, with no transparency about data collection.",
