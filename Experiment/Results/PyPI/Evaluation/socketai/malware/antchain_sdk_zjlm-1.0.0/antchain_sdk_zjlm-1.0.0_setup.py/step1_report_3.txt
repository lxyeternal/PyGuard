  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL containing system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with URL and parameters",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class performs network activity during package installation, sending potentially sensitive system information to an external server without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script using setuptools with a custom install command. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior occurs automatically upon package installation, which is suspicious as it can leak system details without user awareness. There is no indication of malicious payload or backdoors, but the act of exfiltrating system info during setup without explicit consent is a serious privacy concern and can be exploited for reconnaissance or tracking. The URL used ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') suggests data exfiltration to a third-party server.\n\nOverall, the code performs a covert data exfiltration step embedded within package installation, which is a malicious activity in the context of supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, representing a security and privacy risk. It should be considered malicious and avoided.",
