{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external server, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the system environment: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to an external URL through requests.get() with parameters, acting as a sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sources (system info) directly into the requests.get() call, transmitting system details to the external server during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "anomalies": "The network request is embedded within a standard setup script, performing covert data exfiltration without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing a network request during installation to send system info to an external server. No obfuscation or complex logic is present. The behavior indicates an intentional malicious act of data exfiltration, characteristic of supply chain attacks. The data collected includes hostname, current working directory, and username, which are sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as code execution or backdoors. The exfiltration occurs during the install process, making it a covert privacy invasion. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.75-1, security risk similarly high) are justified given the severity of this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, constituting a supply chain attack vector. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The overall security risk is very high, warranting immediate concern and avoidance of this package.",
