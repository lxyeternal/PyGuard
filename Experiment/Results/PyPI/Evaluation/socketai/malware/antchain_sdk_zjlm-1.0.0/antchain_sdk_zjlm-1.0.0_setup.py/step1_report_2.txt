{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "Information from hostname, current directory, and username flows into requests.get() which sends data to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of collecting system info and sending it remotely during package installation without user consent; no comments or warnings about this behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a CustomInstall class that extends the install command. In its run() method, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. This action occurs during package installation, which is suspicious behavior as it leaks system information without user awareness. The server URL appears obfuscated but is actively used to exfiltrate data. The code does not perform any other malicious actions like executing malicious code or modifying files but exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration and potential privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The script intentionally collects and transmits system information during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it can be used for tracking or data theft without user consent.",
