{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' transmits the collected data over the network, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "During the installation, system data is gathered (source) and immediately sent via a network request (sink), creating a data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hidden network request within a custom install class, which is unusual and suspicious. It collects environment data without explicit user consent and transmits it externally. The URL used appears to be a test or interception service, indicating possible data exfiltration or monitoring behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process by subclassing the install command, introducing code that executes during package installation. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this information to an external server. Such behavior can be used for malicious tracking, reconnaissance, or exfiltration of environment details without user awareness. There are no indications of code obfuscation; the malicious behavior is straightforward but hidden within a seemingly legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, actively collecting system information and transmitting it externally during installation. This behavior suggests potential data leakage and privacy invasion, which is highly suspicious. The overall security risk is high due to unauthorized data exfiltration during package setup.",
