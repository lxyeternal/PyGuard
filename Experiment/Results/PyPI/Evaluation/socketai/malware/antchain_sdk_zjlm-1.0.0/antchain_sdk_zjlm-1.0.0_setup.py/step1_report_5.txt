{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure the package installation process, but it also secretly exfiltrates system information during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which acts as a data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "The source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows from the 'run' method to the 'requests.get' call, sending data to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes code that collects system info and transmits it silently during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The exfiltration URL is external and not related to package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools 'install' command with a custom class that overrides 'run'. After executing the normal installation steps, it gathers system info (hostname, current working directory, user) and sends this data to an external URL via a GET request. This behavior is not typical for package setup scripts and indicates malicious intent to spy on or gather user environment data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration during package installation, violating privacy and security norms. It uses a common package setup script as a vector for clandestine data collection.",
