      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, with embedded malicious URL, indicating likely malicious activity. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and potential for remote code execution justify assigning a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. It should be treated as malicious and removed or sandboxed immediately."
