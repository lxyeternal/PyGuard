  "purpose": "The code continuously captures screenshots and sends them to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'ss.png' after saving a screenshot to disk.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with the screenshot as a file attachment.",
  "flows": "The code captures a screenshot -> saves it to 'ss.png' -> reads 'ss.png' -> sends it via POST request to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'wb' mode in open() with .read() is incorrect; it should be 'rb' for reading binary data. The script repeatedly sends screenshots without user consent, which could be used for monitoring. No hardcoded credentials beyond the webhook URL, which itself is exposed here. The webhook URL is hardcoded in the code, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to capture the screen repeatedly every 20 seconds and upload each screenshot to a specified Discord webhook URL. The use of 'wb' in open() is a mistake—reading a file opened in write-binary mode ('wb') will raise an error. Even if corrected to 'rb', the code's behavior of exfiltrating screen captures without user consent is suspicious. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible in the code, which could allow misuse. Overall, the script acts like a basic screen logger and exfiltration tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a screen logger that exfiltrates screenshots to a remote webhook, indicating malicious or unauthorized surveillance behavior. The primary concern is its automated, unconsented data collection and transmission. The webhook URL being hardcoded further supports malicious intent.",
