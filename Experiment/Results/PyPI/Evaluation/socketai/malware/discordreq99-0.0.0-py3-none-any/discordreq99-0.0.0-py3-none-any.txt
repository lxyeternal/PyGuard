      "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The main concern is the package 'discordreq99', which should be examined separately for malicious content or reputation issues. Based on the provided snippet, the dependency is safe, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a modest risk score due to the package name suspicion."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and designed to execute arbitrary payloads, potentially exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. It employs advanced obfuscation techniques and dynamic code execution to evade detection. Scores are justified at maximum levels, and the code should be flagged and avoided for safe use."
