{
  "purpose": "The code is heavily obfuscated, employs dynamic import, eval, exec, nested lambdas, and embedded payloads, indicating malicious intent and potential for remote code execution or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Inputs from __code__, globals(), dynamic import statements, embedded strings, and eval/exec calls.",
  "sinks": "eval, exec, dynamic module loading, file writes, system resource access via MemoryAccess, and potential payload execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from __code__ and obfuscated strings through eval/exec and dynamic imports to code execution and system manipulation points.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded strings, nested lambdas, dynamic import with obfuscated strings, eval/exec usage with embedded payloads, heavy obfuscation, and nested lambdas designed to conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on obfuscation, dynamic import, eval, exec, nested lambdas, and embedded payloads to conceal malicious activities. It uses encoded strings and nested lambdas to evade static analysis, with multiple eval/exec calls executing obfuscated or embedded payloads. The presence of dynamic import of modules, memory access functions, and complex control flow indicates an intent to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or sabotage the system. The code's structure and signals strongly suggest malicious behavior, with high confidence (0.95). The malware score is set to 1 due to clear malicious intent, and obfuscation score close to 1.0. The overall security risk is also at maximum (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and designed to execute arbitrary payloads, potentially exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. It employs advanced obfuscation techniques and dynamic code execution to evade detection. Scores are justified at maximum levels, and the code should be flagged and avoided for safe use.",
