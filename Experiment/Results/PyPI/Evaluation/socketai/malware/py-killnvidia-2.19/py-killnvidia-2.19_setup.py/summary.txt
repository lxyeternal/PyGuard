  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, with a suspicious URL comment. These are strong indicators of malicious activity or payload delivery. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the package should be flagged for further investigation, deobfuscation, and potential removal or warning before distribution."
