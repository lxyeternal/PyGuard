      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with common tactics in malware delivery and sabotage. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, warranting further analysis of the encoded payload and cautious handling."
