  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, with characteristics typical of malicious payloads. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the payload execution poses a significant security threat. The overall security risk is high, and the likelihood of malicious intent is substantial."
