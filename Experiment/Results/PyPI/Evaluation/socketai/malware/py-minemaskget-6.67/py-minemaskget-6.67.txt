      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, with characteristics typical of malicious payloads. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the payload execution poses a significant security threat. The overall security risk is high, and the likelihood of malicious intent is substantial."
