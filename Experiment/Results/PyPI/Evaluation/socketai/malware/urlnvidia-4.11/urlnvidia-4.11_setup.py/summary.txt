  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup. The setup appears legitimate, but the embedded payload indicates potential malicious activity or backdoor. The high obfuscation and concealed execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent, and the package should be treated as potentially compromised until verified."
