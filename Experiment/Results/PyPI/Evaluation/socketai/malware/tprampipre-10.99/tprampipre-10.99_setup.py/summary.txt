  "conclusion": "The code exhibits confirmed malicious indicators: execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with a suspicious URL embedded. The setup script is likely compromised, representing a high security threat. The malware score should be set to 1 due to the high probability of malicious intent, and the overall security risk is extremely high. This package should be flagged and removed from distribution channels."
