  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior involving remote code fetch and execution, system calls, and dynamic code creation. It should be classified as highly malicious malware with maximum risk scores. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores should be set to malware=1, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1 for accurate reflection of severity."
