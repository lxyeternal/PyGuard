{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download and execute remote Python code during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from a remote URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/cry6n/raw') via urlopen, and from the temporary file it creates containing the fetched code.",
  "sinks": "The code executes remote code with exec(), runs a system command to start a process with the current executable, and executes the temporary file containing fetched code, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the remote URL fetch into the temporary file, then from the temporary file into exec() and system calls, resulting in remote code execution and process spawning.",
  "anomalies": "The code creates a temporary file with embedded code that fetches and executes remote content, then runs a system command to execute code, all preceding the setup() function. The remote URL is suspicious, and the code performs dynamic code execution without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file containing a Python snippet that fetches code from a remote URL and executes it via exec(). It then attempts to run this code using a system call, passing the filename as an argument. The setup() function appears standard but is preceded by this malicious code. The remote URL is suspicious, and the pattern indicates remote code execution, a common malware tactic. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but malicious. The fetch-and-execute pattern, combined with system calls, presents a high security risk. The remote URL suggests malicious intent, and executing fetched code without validation is dangerous. The overall behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior involving remote code fetch and execution, system calls, and dynamic code creation. It should be classified as highly malicious malware with maximum risk scores. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores should be set to malware=1, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1 for accurate reflection of severity.",
