  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tls-bypass' package, ostensibly for package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, creating a temporary file, executing system commands, fetching remote data via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands with _ssystem, fetching and executing remote code via exec(_uurlopen(...).read()).",
  "flows": "Remote URL data -> executed via exec() in temporary file -> system command to run the executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual creation and execution of a temporary file containing code fetched from a remote URL; use of system() to start an executable with a modified filename; potential for remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a temporary file that contains code which fetches data from a suspicious URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/cry6n/raw') and executes it. Then, it attempts to run an executable derived from the current Python executable filename with a 'w.exe' suffix, which suggests execution of external code. This behavior indicates possible remote code execution and malicious activity, as the remote URL may deliver harmful code. The setup() function appears normal but is likely used as a cover for malicious actions during package installation. The code's structure and actions strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes remote code fetching and execution, system commands that can run arbitrary code, and obfuscated activities. These behaviors indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior and potential security risk. The package should be considered dangerous for deployment.",
