      "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity, including obfuscation, dynamic script creation, and execution of potentially harmful payloads. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are consistent with its behavior. It should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further detailed analysis and caution."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external input, but this is inherent to proxy handling code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without malicious intent."

The main security concern lies in the external functions and handling of credentials, but within this snippet, it appears safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about external dependencies and credential exposure."
