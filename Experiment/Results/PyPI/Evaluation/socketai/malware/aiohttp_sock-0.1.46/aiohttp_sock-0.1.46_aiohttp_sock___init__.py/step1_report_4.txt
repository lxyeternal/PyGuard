{
  "purpose": "This code module defines and exports classes, functions, and error types related to a proxy connection handling library, likely used for establishing and managing SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from within the package, such as connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "Exported identifiers that could be used by other modules, but no direct sinks for untrusted data or external calls are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here; the code mainly imports and re-exports components without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, defines a version string, and declares __all__ for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or sensitive actions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file or module entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that re-exports classes, functions, and error types for a proxy-related Python package. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are detected in this code fragment.",
