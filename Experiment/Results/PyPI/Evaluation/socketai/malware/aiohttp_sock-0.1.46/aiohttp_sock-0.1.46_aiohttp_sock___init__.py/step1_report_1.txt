{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface or module initialization for a proxy connection library, defining imports, version, and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string assignment, and __all__ listing.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imports and definitions are static; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The version string is straightforward, and the imports are from internal modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and imports, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations. It appears to be a standard module initialization file, possibly __init__.py for a package. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines imports and exports for a proxy-related package component.",
