{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, defining imports and exporting components related to SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs within this code fragment. The code imports modules and defines module-level metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, execute commands, or perform any potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up imports and exports for other parts of the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The version number is a static string; no dynamic or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports and module exports for a proxy library. No input reading, data processing, or network operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python module, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations and appears safe.",
