  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, likely handling SOCKS proxy protocols.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions related to proxy connection handling, error management, and helpers for connection setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and exposes classes and functions for external use; there are no data flows involving user input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The version number is straightforward. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of imports, constants, and __all__ declarations, serving as an interface or API module. It references error classes, helper functions, and protocol types. No data manipulation, input processing, or untrusted data handling occurs here. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data theft, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module for managing proxy connections, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It simply exposes relevant classes and functions for use by other parts of the package.",
