  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core code, its functionality, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward module (likely `__init__.py`) that imports internal components related to proxy handling, error classes, helper functions, and protocol types.\n- It defines a version string and an `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n- There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network activity, or data processing within this snippet.\n- The code appears to be standard for a Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a benign module setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high, given the straightforward nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that this is a standard, benign module initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No problems.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with previous reports, it recognizes the code as a typical interface for a proxy library.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1 — slightly higher but still negligible.\n- **Justification:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Note:** No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports agree that this code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all assessments are justified.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) in report 5 is acceptable and aligns with the code's safety profile.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical Python package module, exposing classes and functions without any dynamic behavior, data handling, or network activity. It is safe and free from malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
