  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, and evaluate the validity of their claims, the scoring, and any potential risks.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward module (likely __init__.py) that imports classes, functions, and error types from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and exports symbols via __all__.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network operations, or data processing.\n- The code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, probably related to SOCKS proxies.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Module setup, defining imports and exports.\n- Findings: No sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a standard module initialization file with no issues. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining module exports.\n- Findings: No untrusted data sinks, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Straightforward import/export code, benign.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a benign, standard setup script. The scoring aligns well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Part of a proxy connection package.\n- Findings: No untrusted data sinks, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Purely import/export, no suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connection module setup.\n- Findings: No data sinks, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Standard import/export code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar module setup.\n- Findings: No untrusted data sinks, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- Notably: Security risk score is 0.1, slightly higher than others.\n- Analysis: The report claims no malicious behavior, and the code is straightforward.\n\n**Justification for security risk score of 0.1:**  \nGiven the code's benign nature, this small risk score might be a conservative placeholder or default. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for module setup, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk:** Should be 0 across all, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Security risk:** Also minimal, but perhaps a tiny default value (0.1) in report 5; however, given the code, it should be 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign module initialization for a proxy library.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores given in all reports are appropriate, with the minor exception of report 5's security risk being slightly elevated, which should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores for this code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 (completely safe)  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical, safe module setup with no malicious or security issues. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
