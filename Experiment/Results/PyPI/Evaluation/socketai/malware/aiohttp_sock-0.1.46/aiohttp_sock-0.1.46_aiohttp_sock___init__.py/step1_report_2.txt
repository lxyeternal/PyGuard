{
  "purpose": "To define module exports and import necessary components for a proxy-related library, facilitating proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no network or data leakage points are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no dynamic data flows or external data handling are observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes and functions from local modules, sets a version string, and defines the __all__ variable for module exports. No external input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious code structures are evident. The absence of network activity, user input processing, or data manipulation indicates a straightforward, benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module initialization with no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It functions as part of a proxy library, exposing classes and functions for external use.",
