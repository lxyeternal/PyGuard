{
  "purpose": "Module setup defining imports and exports for a proxy connection library.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows; static code with no dynamic input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static import/export structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module, likely an __init__.py, establishing public API via __all__. It contains only static import statements and a version string, with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for a proxy connection library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
