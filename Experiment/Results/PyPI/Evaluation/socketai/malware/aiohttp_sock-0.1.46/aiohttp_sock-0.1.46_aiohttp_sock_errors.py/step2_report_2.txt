  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors. There are no functional or dynamic components, no data processing, network activity, or external input/output. Therefore, no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in this code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or malicious elements. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Security risk: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. Since the code is only class definitions, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   No report assigns a risk higher than 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. If any score were higher, I would scrutinize whether malicious intent or obfuscation was present, but here, all scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply state that the code is static, straightforward, and benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely a set of class definitions for exception handling, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. It is a standard pattern in Python for error management, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the current scores. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
