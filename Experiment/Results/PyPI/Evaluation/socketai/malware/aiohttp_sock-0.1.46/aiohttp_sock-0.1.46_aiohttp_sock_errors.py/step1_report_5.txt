  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. It does not include input handling, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be part of a larger module for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
