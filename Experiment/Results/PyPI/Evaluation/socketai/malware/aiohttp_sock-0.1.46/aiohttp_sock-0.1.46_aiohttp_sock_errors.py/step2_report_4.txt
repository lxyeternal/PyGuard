  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.\n   - No input/output, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk levels above 0.5; all are zero.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or risky characteristics.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
