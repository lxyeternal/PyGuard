  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input sources; this code only defines exception classes and does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, no external communication, and no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets up exception classes for potential use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with no unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes like Exception and OSError. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common Python practices for defining custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error handling and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as part of a larger application for SOCKS proxy error management and appears benign.",
