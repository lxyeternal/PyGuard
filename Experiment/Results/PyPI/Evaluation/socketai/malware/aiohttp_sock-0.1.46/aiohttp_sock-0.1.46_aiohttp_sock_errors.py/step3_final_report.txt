  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data output; purely structural class hierarchy.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no runtime logic, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence is high (1) given the static, straightforward structure. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
