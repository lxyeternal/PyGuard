  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes without any input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or vulnerable code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, there's no evidence of malware.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they stick to factual analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is a standard pattern for exception handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided. The code is benign and serves a standard purpose in error handling.",
