  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes and contains no executable logic, data processing, or network interactions.\n   - No issues are present in the code itself; it’s a straightforward class hierarchy for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on static analysis of the class definitions.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; they are grounded in the code's actual content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is purely defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code fragment is benign and standard. It plays a foundational role in error handling but contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code.",
