  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this code only establishes exception class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, subclassing standard exceptions. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. No evidence of malicious activity, data manipulation, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, obfuscation, or anomalous behavior.",
