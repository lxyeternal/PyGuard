{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares exception classes without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; solely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions without unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception classes, primarily for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The structure is typical for defining specific exceptions, and the code does not perform any actions beyond class declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger proxy handling library.",
