  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes, with no input/output, data processing, or network activity.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description in each report. No issues are present; the classes are simple, inheriting from standard exceptions, with no suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign and purely structural. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, which are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions with no runtime behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The reports appropriately assign zero risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is present; the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0), and the confidence scores are high (1).\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No security concerns or malicious intent are evident. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided in the reports.",
