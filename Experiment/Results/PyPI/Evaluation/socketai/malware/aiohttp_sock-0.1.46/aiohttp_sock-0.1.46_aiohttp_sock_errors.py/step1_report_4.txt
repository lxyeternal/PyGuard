  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; code only defines exception classes without any data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are simple exception subclasses with no logic or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines custom exception classes for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There is no input reading, data processing, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior. The code structure is simple and static, serving as error type definitions without any runtime logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code only establishes exception classes to handle specific SOCKS proxy-related errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign, standard pattern for error handling in Python.",
