  "conclusion": "The code is a standard proxy connector implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern lies in the external functions and handling of credentials, but within this snippet, it appears safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about external dependencies and credential exposure."
