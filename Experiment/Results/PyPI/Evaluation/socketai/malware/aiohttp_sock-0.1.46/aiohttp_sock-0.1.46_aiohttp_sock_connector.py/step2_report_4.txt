  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting various proxy types, custom DNS resolution, and dynamic proxy URL construction.\n- The external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are not provided, which introduces some uncertainty about their behavior.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows are evident.\n- The code's purpose aligns with typical proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly states that the code is a standard proxy connector with no malware.\n- The overall logic and flow are straightforward.\n- The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.1).\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n- The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Highlights the reliance on external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) which could be points of concern if malicious.\n- Correctly notes that no malicious code is evident within this snippet.\n- The malware score remains 0, which seems reasonable given the information.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The reasoning is cautious and appropriate.\n- The security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering external dependencies.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Emphasizes the use of a no-resolver, dynamic URL construction, and socket wrapping.\n- Correctly states that no malicious behavior is apparent.\n- The confidence is high, malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code.\n- The risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Focuses on the potential exposure of proxy credentials via URL, which is a valid security consideration.\n- Notes reliance on external functions but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The reasoning is balanced.\n- The security risk score (0.2) is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to previous, notes external dependencies and standard proxy handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Reasoning is consistent.\n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, as expected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the external dependencies and dynamic URL construction.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concerns about external functions and credential handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with configurable options. The external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are potential points of concern if malicious, but within this snippet, no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Keep an eye on the external functions' implementations for future assessments.\n- Ensure proxy credentials are handled securely in deployment to prevent leaks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2            |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's legitimacy and aligns with the provided reports.",
