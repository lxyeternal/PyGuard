  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a proxy connector implementation supporting HTTP and other proxy types, with dynamic URL construction, socket wrapping, and optional DNS resolution control.\n- External functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are critical points. Their implementations are not shown, which introduces some uncertainty.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows are evident.\n- Proxy credentials are embedded in URLs, which is standard but should be handled carefully to avoid leaks.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malware is present in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- The code appears free of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are potential points of concern if malicious, but based on this code alone, there's no indication they are compromised.\n\n**Scores Validation:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the readable, standard code.\n- Security risks are rated between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minor concerns mainly about credential handling and external dependencies, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Risk Scores > 0.5?**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's apparent purpose and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points & Recommendations:\n\n1. **External Function Dependency:**\n   - The security of `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` is critical.\n   - If these functions are malicious or compromised, they could introduce vulnerabilities or malware.\n   - The reports correctly identify this as a potential concern but note that within this code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n2. **Proxy Credential Handling:**\n   - Embedding credentials in URLs is standard but can lead to leakage if URLs are logged or exposed.\n   - No direct issues are observed, but it's worth noting in security assessments.\n\n3. **Socket Wrapping & Connection:**\n   - The code differentiates proxy types and creates sockets accordingly.\n   - If `create_socket_wrapper` is malicious, it could manipulate or exfiltrate data.\n   - The reports acknowledge this dependency but do not find evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across reports; no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external functions and credential handling, a conservative estimate would be around **0.2**, aligning with the reports' ratings.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a proxy connector supporting various proxy types.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet.\n- The main security concern is the external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), which could be malicious if compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2            |\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence, acknowledging external dependencies as potential risk points but considering the code itself safe and legitimate.",
