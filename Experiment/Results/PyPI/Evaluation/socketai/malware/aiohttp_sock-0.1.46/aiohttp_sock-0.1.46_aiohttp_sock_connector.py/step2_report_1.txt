  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a custom proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting various proxy types.\n- Uses external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) for socket creation and URL parsing.\n- Constructs proxy URLs dynamically, potentially including credentials.\n- Supports a no-resolver option to bypass DNS resolution.\n- Handles connection wrapping for non-HTTP proxies.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior / Malware**\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a proxy connector with flexible configuration.\n\n- **External Functions:**  \n  The functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are external. Their implementation is unknown, which introduces some uncertainty. If malicious, they could perform harmful actions, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n- **Proxy Credentials in URLs:**  \n  Credentials are included in URLs, which is standard but should be handled carefully to avoid leaks. No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious credential handling.\n\n- **Socket Handling:**  \n  Socket creation via `create_socket_wrapper` could be a vector if the function is malicious, but no evidence suggests this here.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo signs of malware or malicious code within this snippet.\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the above, **0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Obfuscation**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with clear class and method definitions.  \n- No obfuscated code, encrypted strings, or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Security Risk / Logical Consistency**\n\n- **Input Handling:**  \n  Proxy URLs and parameters are constructed dynamically from user input. This is standard but requires careful handling to prevent leaks.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - Credentials in URLs could be exposed if logs are not sanitized.\n  - External functions could be malicious, but within this code, no such behavior is evident.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  The reports assign a low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable.  \n  The code's main risk is in the external functions and handling of user-provided data, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Security risk score:**  \n**0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Scores Consistency & Reasonableness**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), matching the analysis.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Overall Expert Estimate**\n\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, mostly related to external functions and credential handling)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes:**\n\n- The external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are critical points. If malicious, they could introduce risks, but within this code, there's no evidence.\n- Proper handling of credentials and logs is essential in deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2             |\n\n**This assessment aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.**",
