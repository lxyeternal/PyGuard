  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, the potential security implications, and the consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution. No malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but acceptable given the network operations involved.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence level (0.9) is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with the previous report.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly lower, reflecting perhaps a more conservative assessment.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The report emphasizes the standard nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard implementation with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Consistent assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy client code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis aligns with previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2; given the code handles network connections and credentials, a low risk score is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The logic and flow follow established protocols.\n- No suspicious network behaviors or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering the nature of proxy handling, but acknowledging potential risks if misconfigured.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The provided scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
