{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous Python implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for connecting through proxies, handling negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports for destination addresses, proxy server host and port, and optional credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow through socket connections, address resolution, and authentication steps; particularly, data sent to and received from the proxy server and destination host.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) is used in address resolution and proxy negotiation. Data flows from socket connection setup through proxy negotiation, including authentication if required, culminating in establishing a tunnel for further data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for SOCKS proxy handling with no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious network behavior or obfuscated code is present. Error handling is straightforward. No unusual or malformed code structures. No malicious behavior or privacy violations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client functionality using asyncio, including address resolution, connection, and negotiation. Error handling is implemented with custom exceptions. The code relies on standard socket operations and asyncio's event loop. No hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, or malicious activities are apparent. The use of external modules like 'errors' appears normal and only provides exception handling. The overall logic aligns with standard proxy client patterns, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous Python applications. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions as intended for proxy connection management without any malicious intent.",
