{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from network sockets via sock_recv, sock_connect, and address resolution functions. User credentials and hostnames are potentially read for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations such as sock_sendall, sock_recv, and sock_connect; handling of hostnames, IP addresses, and credentials that could be used for malicious data exfiltration or command execution if manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input sources (hostnames, credentials, socket responses) through negotiation and authentication procedures, ultimately establishing a connection to a destination host via a proxy server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code handles DNS resolution and remote address resolution (rdns). No suspicious or unusual data manipulation is evident. The code is structured and standard for SOCKS proxy handling, with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The module implements standard SOCKS proxy connection protocols with proper handling of network communication, error states, and address resolution. No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior are detected. The code performs expected operations for establishing proxied network connections without suspicious modifications, backdoors, or data exfiltration techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and adheres to normal practices for network proxy handling.",
