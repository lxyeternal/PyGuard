{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports provided for destination and proxy servers, as well as optional username/password for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over network sockets via sock_sendall, potentially including proxy negotiation requests, authentication credentials, and destination addresses.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication processes, then proceeds via negotiated proxy connection to reach the target address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network connections or data leaks detected. The code performs standard proxy connection procedures with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses asyncio's socket methods for non-blocking communication, resolving hostnames locally or remotely based on configuration. It handles proxy negotiation protocols correctly, including version verification, authentication, and address handling. Error handling appears standard, and no malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The code follows typical patterns for proxy client implementation without suspicious or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation, following standard procedures without malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles network communication, address resolution, and authentication without evident anomalies.",
