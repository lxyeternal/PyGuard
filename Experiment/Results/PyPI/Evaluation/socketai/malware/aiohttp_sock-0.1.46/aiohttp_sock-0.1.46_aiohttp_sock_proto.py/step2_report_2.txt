  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the descriptions provided.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client logic with asynchronous socket operations.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behaviors are evident.\n- Address resolution (local or remote) is handled appropriately.\n- Error handling follows standard patterns.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Accurate description; standard SOCKS proxy client logic.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identifies network data and credentials as sources; data sent/received over sockets as sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior noted.\n- **Analysis:** Well-aligned with standard protocol implementation; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given standard implementation)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SOCKS proxy handling, no malicious activity, and proper error handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Reiterates standard implementation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (even lower, reflecting minimal risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar assessment; standard SOCKS proxy logic, no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Again, aligns with previous assessments; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1–0.2), reflecting standard network code with typical address resolution and socket handling.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- Given the detailed review, I agree with the assigned scores. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & My Own Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard network code, minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: ~0.2\n\nThis reflects a low-security risk, standard implementation, and no malware presence.",
