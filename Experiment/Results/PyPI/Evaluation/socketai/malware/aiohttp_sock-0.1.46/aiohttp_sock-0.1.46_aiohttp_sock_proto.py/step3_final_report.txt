  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client protocols with asynchronous socket handling, including connection, negotiation, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostname, port, user credentials, and socket connection parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through socket send/receive operations, address resolution, and protocol negotiation responses.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hostnames, credentials) are processed through address resolution and protocol negotiation functions, leading to socket communication and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior are present. The code follows standard protocol implementations without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles connection setup, authentication, and address resolution correctly, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The data flow involves typical socket operations and address processing, with no suspicious or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It poses minimal security risks, primarily related to handling untrusted inputs, which is inherent in proxy operations. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
