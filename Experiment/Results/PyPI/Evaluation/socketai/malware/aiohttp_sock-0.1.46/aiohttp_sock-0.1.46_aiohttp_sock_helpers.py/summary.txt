  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external input, but this is inherent to proxy handling code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without malicious intent."
