{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to establish network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting asynchronous operations and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables indirectly (via socket creation), and proxy URLs provided as strings.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets and asyncio connection methods that establish outbound connections, potentially exposing data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, socks_url) flow through parsing functions into socket wrapper creation, which then flows into network connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious URL handling. Use of untrusted input (proxy URLs) is expected but not malicious. No malicious code behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code properly parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and establishes network connections asynchronously. It correctly validates input parameters and raises appropriate exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries (aiohttp_sock, yarl) is standard for proxy handling. The code's structure is typical for network connection utilities. No suspicious or malicious anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection utilities. There are no indications of malware or malicious intent. The only potential concern is reliance on user-provided proxy URLs, which should be validated externally, but this is not inherently malicious.",
