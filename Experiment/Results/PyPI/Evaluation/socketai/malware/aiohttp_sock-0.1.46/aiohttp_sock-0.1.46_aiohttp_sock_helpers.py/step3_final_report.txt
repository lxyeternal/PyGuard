  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse proxy URLs, create SOCKS proxy socket wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), and establish network connections via asyncio.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, user-supplied host and port, external libraries (aiohttp_sock, yarl).",
  "sinks": "Network connection establishment, socket connection, asyncio's open_connection and create_connection functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port) -> parsing and validation -> socket wrapper creation -> connection via sock.connect() -> data flow to network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Proper validation and exception handling are in place.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy URL parsing, socket wrapper creation for SOCKS4/5, and connection establishment using asyncio. It validates inputs, handles exceptions, and relies on external libraries appropriately. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of user-provided proxy URLs introduces typical security considerations but is standard in proxy utilities. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external input, but this is inherent to proxy handling code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk without malicious intent.",
