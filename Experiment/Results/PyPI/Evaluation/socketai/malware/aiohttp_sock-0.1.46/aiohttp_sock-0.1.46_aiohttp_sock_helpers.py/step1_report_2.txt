{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs and opening network connections through specified proxies.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs with unquote and URL parsing; reading parameters such as host, port, username, password from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers, connecting to hosts via proxies, opening asyncio network connections, and creating connections via event loop.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing extracts credentials and proxy info, which flow into socket wrapper creation; socket connects to target host, then connection is established and data can flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or malicious strings; no suspicious dynamic execution or unusual control flows; error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles the setup of proxy connections using standard libraries and external modules. It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS proxies, and establishes network connections through asyncio event loop. No embedded malicious behavior, backdoors, or unauthorized data access is evident. All operations are consistent with typical proxy connection logic, with no suspicious anomalies or secret data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard proxy connection setup and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles proxy URL parsing, socket creation, and network connection procedures without suspicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
