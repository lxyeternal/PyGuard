{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated malicious script designed to decode and execute hidden payloads, potentially malicious or harmful actions.",
  "sources": "eval() with obfuscated strings, base64 decoding functions, and decode() calls on decoded data. Data is read from heavily obfuscated base64-encoded strings within the code.",
  "sinks": "executes decoded data via eval(), which could run malicious code, and decodes and potentially executes hidden payloads without transparency.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated strings are base64 decoded, then further decoded and passed into eval(), indicating a flow from encoded payloads to execution, hiding malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with multiple layers of base64 encoding, eval() usage on dynamically decoded data, and the decoding of potentially malicious payloads suggest malicious obfuscation. The code does not perform any clear legitimate function, instead focusing on decoding and executing hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with heavily obfuscated eval() calls that decode base64-encoded strings, which are further decoded and processed through multiple layers of decoding functions. The use of eval() on decoded strings strongly indicates dynamic execution of code that is hidden from straightforward analysis. The presence of base64-encoded data that, when decoded, can contain malicious payloads, coupled with functions named and structured to obscure their purpose, raises high suspicion. The pattern of decoding, then executing, is characteristic of malicious payload deployment or backdoor creation. The overall structure suggests an intent to conceal malicious behavior through obfuscation, and the core logic appears to be to decode and run hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and appears designed to hide malicious payloads. It decodes base64-encoded strings and executes the result via eval(), which is a common technique for executing hidden or malicious scripts. There are no legitimate or benign functions identifiable, and the heavy obfuscation indicates malicious intent.",
