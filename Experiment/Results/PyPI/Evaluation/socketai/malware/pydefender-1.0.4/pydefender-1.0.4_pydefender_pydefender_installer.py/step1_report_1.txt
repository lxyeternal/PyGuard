  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The 'webhook_url' variable and the 'message' string, which are hardcoded in the code.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.post' function which sends data to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The 'webhook_url' and 'message' are used to construct the data payload, which is then sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, potentially allowing external control or manipulation if the code is modified. The code performs no validation or obfuscation. The message content is static. No user input is processed, reducing risk of injection.",
  "analysis": "The script's core function is to notify a Discord webhook that the package has been installed. It uses hardcoded URL and message, with no dynamic input or secret management. The data is serialized to JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request with appropriate headers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of a Discord webhook for notification is common in deployment scripts but can be misused if the webhook URL is exposed. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple notification sender to a Discord webhook with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions beyond sending a message. The main concern is exposure of the webhook URL if the code is publicly shared, but this alone does not indicate malicious activity.",
