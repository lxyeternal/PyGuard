{
  "purpose": "The code sends a notification message to a Discord webhook when the package is installed.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL is hardcoded in the variable 'webhook_url'. The message content is also hardcoded as 'El paquete pydefender se ha instalado correctamente.'",
  "sinks": "The code performs an HTTP POST request to the specified Discord webhook URL with the message content.",
  "flows": "Data from the 'webhook_url' and 'message' variables are used to construct the JSON payload sent via requests.post to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated code present. Hardcoded URL and message may indicate potential for misuse if the URL is malicious or misleading, but there is no dynamic or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script simply notifies a Discord channel that a package has been installed, by sending a fixed message to a predefined webhook URL. The code uses standard libraries (requests and json) and performs a straightforward HTTP POST. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow. The hardcoded webhook URL could be a concern if it points to an attacker-controlled channel, but based solely on this code, it is a typical notification mechanism. There are no input sources from untrusted origins; all data is predefined within the script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic notification script with no evident malicious intent. Its primary function is to inform via Discord when the package is installed. While the hardcoded webhook could be exploited if malicious, in itself, the code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malware. The security risk is minimal but depends on the trustworthiness of the webhook URL.",
