{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded webhook URL and a fixed message string.",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP POST request to the Discord webhook URL with the message data.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a JSON payload from a hardcoded message and sends it directly to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; straightforward usage of requests library and hardcoded values.",
  "analysis": "The script's main function prepares a JSON payload containing a static message indicating package installation success. It then makes a POST request to a specified Discord webhook URL, effectively notifying about installation. The URL is hardcoded, which is common for webhook integrations. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or dynamic data involved, reducing the risk of malicious input manipulation. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system modification are present. The code appears benign and solely intended for notification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple notification script that posts a message to a Discord webhook. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of the webhook URL in code is a potential security concern if exposed publicly, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this code is low risk and benign.",
