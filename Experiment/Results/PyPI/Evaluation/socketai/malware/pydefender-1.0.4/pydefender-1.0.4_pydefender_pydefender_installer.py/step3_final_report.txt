{
  "purpose": "The code sends a fixed notification message to a specified Discord webhook URL upon package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; the webhook URL and message are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the webhook URL with static data could be exploited if the URL is malicious or exposed.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a JSON payload with the message and sends it via requests.post to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL and message are hardcoded; no obfuscation or dynamic data; no malicious code or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, performing a simple POST request to a known URL with static content. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The primary concern is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be misused if compromised. The code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation are confirmed. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate, with high confidence. The risk could slightly increase if the webhook URL is malicious or publicly accessible, but based on the code alone, it remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign notification script with no malware or obfuscation. The main security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which should be managed securely. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code poses no malicious threat.",
