{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of a package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it defines static strings for the webhook URL and message.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends data over the network to a specified URL, potentially leaking data if the URL or message contains sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Static URL and message are used to create a JSON payload which is sent via POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically triggers a network request upon execution, which may be used for tracking or spam purposes; the webhook URL is hardcoded, and the message indicates installation confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it constructs a JSON payload with a fixed message and posts it to a specified Discord webhook URL. No untrusted input is processed; the URL and message are static. The code’s purpose appears to be to notify a specific channel about package installation. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be a privacy concern or indicate a mechanism for tracking or alerting. There is no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, credential theft, or backdoors. The network activity is intentional and typical for notifications, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple notification sender to a Discord webhook. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its primary concern is that it automates a network request upon package installation, which could be used for tracking or spam, but not inherently malicious.",
