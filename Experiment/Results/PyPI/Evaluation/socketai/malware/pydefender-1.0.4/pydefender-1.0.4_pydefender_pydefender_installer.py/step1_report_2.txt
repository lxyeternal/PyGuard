  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that the package has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external untrusted input; the only data source is a hardcoded webhook URL and message string.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the Discord webhook URL, which sends data to an external server.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a JSON payload containing a fixed message and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL and message, which is typical for notifications; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it defines a webhook URL, prepares a message, converts it to JSON, and posts it to the webhook. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The URL appears to be a Discord webhook, and the message indicates a package installation notification. No user input is processed, and the code does not perform any unusual or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a notification sender upon package installation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of a Discord webhook for notification is common and not inherently malicious.",
