  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pydefender' Python package, facilitating installation, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, author info, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; setup configuration does not execute code or handle input.",
  "flows": "Defines package installation parameters, dependencies, and CLI entry points; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Includes 'sockets' in install_requires, which is a standard library module, unlikely to be malicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and command-line entry points. No code execution, data handling, or network operations are embedded here. All dependencies are standard or widely used, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The inclusion of 'sockets' is a benign reference to a standard library, not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
