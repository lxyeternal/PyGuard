{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point for the 'pydefender' package, intended for file obfuscation and related functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies list, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the script does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata to dependencies and entry point, with no dynamic data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious dependencies. All dependencies are common, and the entry point references a function outside this snippet. No code execution or network activity occurs here. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of this configuration. The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward analysis. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'pydefender.installer:main', which is outside this scope, but the setup script itself shows no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
