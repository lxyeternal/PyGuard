{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely intended for malicious activity or clandestine data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Decoding functions, environment variables, and base64-encoded payloads used as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication (decoding and executing payloads), file writing, and possible system command execution.",
  "flows": "Code reads and decodes encoded strings -> processes data through multiple decoding steps -> possibly executes or transmits data to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() with hex-encoded strings, multiple layers of base64 decoding, heavily obfuscated code, dynamic decoding and execution, obfuscated variable names, and large embedded encoded payloads. The code appears designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a heavily obfuscated eval() call involving hex-encoded string, which is then used to import modules or execute code. The core functions involve multiple layers of decoding (base64 and hex) and dynamic evaluation, which are typical techniques to hide malicious payloads. The presence of base64 strings containing binary data suggests payload delivery or system commands encoded to evade static detection. The code dynamically decodes, processes, and likely executes obfuscated data, possibly executing malicious payloads or exfiltrating data. The use of eval() and multiple decoding layers increases the likelihood of malicious intent, especially as these are common in malware or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated with multiple decoding layers, eval() calls, and dynamic execution, indicating malicious intent. It is likely designed to hide and execute malicious payloads or perform covert operations such as data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
