{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that the package has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; the webhook URL and message are hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with a JSON payload containing a static message.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a JSON payload with a predefined message and sends it directly to the Discord webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which may pose a security risk if exposed; the message is static and unaltered, no user input or external data processed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' and 'json' libraries, defines a main() function that sets a webhook URL and message, then sends a POST request to the webhook with this data. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the hardcoded webhook URL, which, if exposed, could allow others to send messages to the same channel. However, this alone does not constitute malicious activity. The script's purpose appears to be benign notification after package installation, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple notification sender with no malicious behavior. The primary concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which should be kept secret to prevent misuse. Overall, it does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks beyond the exposure of the webhook URL.",
