  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Webhook URL string and message string defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function which sends data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Data from hardcoded webhook URL and message flows through JSON serialization into an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded webhook URL which could be used maliciously if the URL is exposed or misused; no user input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and 'json' modules, defines a main() function that posts a fixed message to a specified Discord webhook URL, and executes this function when run as a script. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could pose a risk if the code is distributed or compromised, as it allows any recipient of the code to send messages to the specified Discord channel. The message content is static and does not depend on external input, reducing the likelihood of injection or malicious payloads. There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to send a notification to a Discord channel when the package is installed. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL could be exploited if the code is distributed or leaks, potentially allowing malicious actors to send messages to the associated Discord channel. However, the code itself does not perform any malicious activities or malicious payload delivery. Overall, this appears to be a benign notification script with a moderate security concern related to exposure of the webhook URL.",
