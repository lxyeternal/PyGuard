{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the static URL string for the Discord webhook and the static message string.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends data over the network to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The static message is packaged into JSON and sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be used to send notifications to an attacker's Discord channel; no user input or dynamic data involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and json modules, defines a main function that prepares a webhook URL and a message, formats the data as JSON, and sends it via POST request. The URL is hardcoded, and the message indicates a successful installation. This setup resembles a typical notification script; however, the presence of a hardcoded webhook URL could be used maliciously to send data or notifications to an attacker-controlled channel. The code does not collect or leak sensitive user data, nor does it perform any harmful operations. There is no obfuscation or suspicious behavior beyond the hardcoded webhook, which is a potential security concern if the URL is not intended for trusted use.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward notification sender for successful package installation, but the hardcoded webhook URL could be exploited if misused. It does not contain malicious code or malware, but the hardcoded URL should be scrutinized for intent and access control.",
