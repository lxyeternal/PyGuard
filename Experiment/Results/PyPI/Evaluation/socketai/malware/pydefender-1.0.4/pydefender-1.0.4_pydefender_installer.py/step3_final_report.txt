  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded webhook URL in the code.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sending data to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a JSON payload with the message and posts it directly to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded in the script, which could lead to misuse if exposed publicly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that sends a static message to a specified Discord webhook URL. It does not process user input, environment variables, or external data sources. The webhook URL is embedded directly, which is a security concern but not malicious. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The primary risk is the exposure of the webhook URL, which could be exploited to send unauthorized messages. The code's behavior is benign, and the security risk stems from the URL exposure rather than malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting moderate concern over the exposed URL. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely to send a static notification message. The main security concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be misused if leaked. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
