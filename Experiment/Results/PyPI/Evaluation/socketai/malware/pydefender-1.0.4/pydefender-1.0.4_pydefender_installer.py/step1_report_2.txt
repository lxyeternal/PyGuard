{
  "purpose": "The code sends a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that the package has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The code reads the webhook URL, the message string, and the JSON data constructed for the HTTP POST request.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends data over the network to a Discord webhook URL, potentially leaking information if the URL or message contains sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Source: webhook_url and message variables -> data dictionary -> json.dumps -> requests.post with JSON payload -> network transmission to Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could lead to unintended information leakage if exposed. The code triggers an external network request unconditionally upon execution. No user input or environment variables are used, reducing complexity. The message content is static. No data exfiltration or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, sending a static message to a specified Discord webhook URL. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, command execution, or obfuscation. The hardcoded webhook URL could be a privacy concern if the source code is exposed, but this alone is not malicious. The network request is a simple notification, typical for logging or alerting purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple notification sender upon package installation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is the exposure of the webhook URL, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions.",
