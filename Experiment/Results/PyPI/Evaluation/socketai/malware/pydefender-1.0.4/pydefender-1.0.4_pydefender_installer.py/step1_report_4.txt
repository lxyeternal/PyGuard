{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded webhook URL and a fixed message string.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends data over the network to the specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded URL and message are packaged into JSON and sent via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; the webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be considered a security concern if exposed, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports requests and json libraries, defines a main function that sets a Discord webhook URL and a fixed message, converts the message into JSON, and posts it to the webhook. The URL is publicly visible in the code, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. The code's purpose appears to be to notify about installation status. No input from untrusted sources is processed, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations beyond network communication with a known endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sends a notification to a specified Discord webhook, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. Its security risk is minimal, but hardcoded webhook URLs should be managed carefully to prevent misuse.",
