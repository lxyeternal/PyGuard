  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating successful installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL and the message string are defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends data over the network to the specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The message string and the webhook URL are used as inputs; the data is serialized to JSON and sent via HTTP POST to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded; the code performs a network request during execution which could be used for unintentional data transmission if the URL or message were maliciously modified. No obfuscated code, secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a fixed webhook URL and a static message indicating package installation success. It converts the message into JSON and posts it to the webhook URL using the requests library. The URL appears legitimate for a Discord webhook and is publicly accessible. There are no dynamic inputs, no suspicious code patterns, and no evidence of malicious intent. The code's sole purpose is to notify an external service upon package installation, which is a common practice in deployment or monitoring scripts. There are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data involved. The network request is straightforward and does not perform any data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose of notification upon package installation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The only concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be misused if modified maliciously, but in this context, it appears legitimate and intended for notifications.",
