  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses hardcoded webhook URL and message.",
  "sinks": "Performs an HTTP POST request to the specified Discord webhook URL with JSON data.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded webhook URL and message are used directly in the HTTP POST request.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if compromised; no input validation or dynamic data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a fixed webhook URL and a static message, then sends this message via a POST request to the Discord webhook. There are no external inputs, no user data, nor dynamic execution. The hardcoded URL might be sensitive if exposed, but it is typical for webhook integrations. The code performs a simple notification action without any obfuscation or suspicious logic. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data theft is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sends a predefined message to a specified Discord webhook, likely for notification purposes during package installation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which should be protected to prevent misuse.",
