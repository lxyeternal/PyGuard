  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook upon execution, indicating successful installation of a package.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded webhook URL and a message string; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call sends data to an external URL (Discord webhook).",
  "flows": "The code constructs a JSON payload with a message and posts it directly to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be used to send notifications or potentially exfiltrate data if misused. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs (not used here).",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and json modules. It defines a main function that sets a Discord webhook URL and a notification message. It constructs a JSON payload with the message and sends it via a POST request to the webhook URL. The URL appears to be a legitimate Discord webhook. The purpose seems to be notifying about the installation event. There are no inputs from the user, no dynamic URL generation, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The code's behavior is benign in the context of its purpose. However, if this code is embedded within a package, it could be used for unwanted notifications or exfiltration if the webhook URL is controlled by an attacker, but in isolation, it appears straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to send a notification to a Discord webhook upon execution. There is no malicious behavior or suspicious activity evident in this snippet. The hardcoded webhook URL could be a privacy concern or used maliciously if controlled by an attacker, but based on the provided code alone, it is not malicious.",
