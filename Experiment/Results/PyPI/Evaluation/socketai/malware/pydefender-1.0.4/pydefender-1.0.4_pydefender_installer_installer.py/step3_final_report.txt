  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook upon script execution.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded webhook URL in the variable 'webhook_url'.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sending data to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The script loads the URL, constructs a JSON payload with a static message, and posts it to the webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation or dynamic data; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that posts a static message to a specified Discord webhook URL. It does not process user input, perform data exfiltration, or execute malicious actions. The only notable aspect is the hardcoded URL, which could be misused if the code is embedded maliciously or the URL is compromised. The code is free of obfuscation, vulnerabilities, or malicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the primary concern being the exposure of the webhook URL. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a notification sender with a hardcoded webhook URL. The main security consideration is the exposure of this URL, which could be exploited if misused. No malicious intent or activity is detected. The scores are appropriate, with a low malware and obfuscation score, and a minor risk score reflecting the potential misuse of the URL.",
