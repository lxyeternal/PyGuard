{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating the package has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded URL 'webhook_url' and the message string 'message'.",
  "sinks": "The POST request to the Discord webhook endpoint with the JSON payload.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded webhook URL and message are used to construct a JSON payload, which is sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded in the script, and the code performs an external HTTP request unconditionally. No input validation or dynamic data processing. The URL appears specific and could potentially be used maliciously if misused, but in itself, it does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script's main function constructs a notification message and sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL. The URL is hardcoded and publicly accessible, which could be a concern if the code is distributed or used maliciously, but in this context, it simply posts a static message. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or data exfiltration. The code performs a straightforward HTTP POST request with no external inputs or sensitive data handling. It does not perform any suspicious actions such as data collection, exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply sends a predefined message to a Discord webhook. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. However, the hardcoded webhook URL could be misused if embedded in malicious packages or scripts, but on its own, it appears benign.",
