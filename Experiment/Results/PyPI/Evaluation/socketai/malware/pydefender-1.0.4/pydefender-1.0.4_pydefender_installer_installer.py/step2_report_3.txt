  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply sends a static notification message to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.\n   - No external inputs, no dynamic data, no obfuscation, no code injection, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and benign in its current form.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The only notable flaw is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could pose security or privacy concerns if the URL is sensitive or if the code is distributed maliciously.\n   - No validation or sanitization is performed, but given the static nature, this is not inherently problematic.\n   - No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are identified.\n\n3. **Score Review & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Consistently at 0.2, reflecting a minor concern mainly due to the hardcoded webhook URL. This seems reasonable; it's a low risk unless the URL is malicious or sensitive.\n   - **Risk Score (>0.5):** No report exceeds 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Activity & Assumptions:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The presence of a webhook URL could be exploited if an attacker replaces it with a malicious one, but this is a risk of misconfiguration or misuse, not inherent maliciousness.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n5. **Consistency & Additional Considerations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No evidence suggests the code is malicious or obfuscated.\n   - The main concern is the static webhook URL, which should be protected, but this does not elevate the risk score significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (minor concern due to hardcoded URL, but not a vulnerability)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a simple notification sender with no malicious intent. The main concern is the static webhook URL, which should be kept secret to prevent misuse, but it does not constitute a security threat in itself.\n\n**Note:** If this code were embedded in a package and distributed, the hardcoded URL could be exploited if an attacker replaces or intercepts it. However, based solely on the code snippet and reports, there is no malware or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the webhook URL secret and avoid hardcoding sensitive URLs in production code.  \n- No change to malware or obfuscated scores.  \n- Slightly increase risk score if considering potential misuse, but 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
