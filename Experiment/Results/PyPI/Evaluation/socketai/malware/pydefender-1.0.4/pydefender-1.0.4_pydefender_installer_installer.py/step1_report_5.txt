{
  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that the package pydefender has been installed successfully.",
  "sources": "The code reads the webhook URL, message string, and constructs a JSON payload for the POST request.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data over the network to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Input data (webhook URL, message) is used to create JSON payload, which is then posted to the Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically posts to an external URL without validation; the webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be misused if compromised. No obfuscation or hidden code. No user input involved.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a fixed webhook URL and message, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via HTTP POST to Discord. There is no user input, no dynamic data collection, no code injection, or other suspicious activity. The code's purpose appears to be to send a notification upon installation. While the code itself isn't malicious, hardcoded webhook URL could be exploited if the code is distributed or modified maliciously to send notifications elsewhere, or if the webhook URL is compromised. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system control, or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward task of sending a notification to a specified Discord webhook. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. However, the hardcoded webhook URL could be used maliciously if misused, but in this context, the code itself appears benign.",
