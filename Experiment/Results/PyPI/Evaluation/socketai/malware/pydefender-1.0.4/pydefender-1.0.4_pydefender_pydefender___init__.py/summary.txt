  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that could be exploited maliciously, such as sending data externally and executing an installer script at shutdown without validation. The hardcoded webhook URL and subprocess call increase the security risk. While not definitively malicious, the pattern warrants a high suspicion level and should be reviewed further. The malware score should be set around 0.6, and the security risk around 0.75, to accurately reflect the potential threat."
