{
  "purpose": "The script attempts to set up a Python package named 'libhackedloadtool' and installs a package called 'modlib'. Additionally, it executes a hidden PowerShell command likely for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' and possibly executes a subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command is a sink where untrusted or malicious code could execute commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg', then if not found, executes an encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen; this flow could lead to remote or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed with subprocess, potential obfuscation, and the use of creationflags to hide the window. The package setup appears legitimate but could be a cover for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If not found, it runs a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess with an encoded command, which is suspicious and often used for malicious purposes. The setup() function installs a package named 'libhackedloadtool' with package 'modlib'. The combination suggests an attempt to blend malicious behavior with legitimate package setup. The encoded PowerShell command may be a payload or backdoor component. Overall, the code demonstrates suspicious behavior with obfuscation, hidden execution, and potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably the execution of an encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which is a common tactic for malicious activity. The package setup may be a cover for malicious actions. The overall security risk is high due to these signs.",
