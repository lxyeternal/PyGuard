  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state, indicative of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the embedded payload. The high obfuscation and silent execution increase suspicion, and the package should be flagged for further review. Decoding the payload is recommended to understand its full impact."
