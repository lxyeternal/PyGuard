  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code indicators such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external data sources, code imports, and potential network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system access, system commands, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data from sources like environment variables or user input passing through code constructs such as eval/exec or network functions to sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, unusual code structures, or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of potential malicious intent if it contains dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Reports indicating such patterns are assigned higher malware and security risk scores. Benign code lacking anomalies receives low scores. The scores are consistent with the described anomalies and reasoning. No code was provided for some reports, which aligns with their conclusions. Adjustments are made to reflect that benign assessments should have minimal or zero risk scores, and suspicion levels are justified by the indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious indicators. Report 1 shows signs of suspicious activity with appropriate high scores. Reports 2, 3, and 5 are benign with low or zero scores. Report 4 notes some obfuscation but no definitive malicious activity, which is justified. The overall scoring aligns with the evidence, with minor adjustments to risk scores for benign reports. The assessments are consistent, and no major overestimations are present.",
