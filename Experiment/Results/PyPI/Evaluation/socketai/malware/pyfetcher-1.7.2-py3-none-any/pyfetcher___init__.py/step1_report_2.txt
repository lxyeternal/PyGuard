  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or script that performs specific tasks, possibly related to data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files, depending on the specific implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach sensitive operations such as network communication, file writing, or execution functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network sockets or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code does not contain obfuscated constructs or malicious behavior indicators.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard Python constructs. No suspicious imports or function calls are present. The code does not attempt to perform unsafe operations or conceal its intentions. The absence of obfuscation or unusual code flow suggests benign behavior. Without additional context or external dependencies, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
