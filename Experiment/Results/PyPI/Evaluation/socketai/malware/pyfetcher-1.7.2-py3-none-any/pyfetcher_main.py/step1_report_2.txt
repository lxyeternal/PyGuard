{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a specified URL and then launches it locally.",
  "sources": "Reading system username via os.getlogin(), and downloading data from an external URL using requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded executable to disk with open() and executing it with os.startfile().",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) to local storage (sink), then from local storage to execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a file path in the user's Documents folder based on the system username, then downloads and executes a remote file without validation. The URL points to an external server with a suspicious IP address and filename 'Netflix_Checker.exe', indicating potential malicious intent. The use of os.startfile() to execute the downloaded file is a high-risk behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script collects the current user login name, then downloads an executable from a hardcoded IP address URL, saving it to the user's Documents folder under a specific filename. It then immediately executes this file. There are no validation or integrity checks on the downloaded file. The URL's IP address and filename suggest possible malicious activity, such as remote code execution or malware distribution. The use of os.startfile() for executing the downloaded file indicates intent to run potentially harmful code without user interaction or safeguards. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present beyond the potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to downloading and executing a remote executable without validation, with indications of malicious intent based on the URL and behavior. It can facilitate remote malware deployment and system compromise.",
