{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it on the local system.",
  "sources": "The code reads the username via os.getlogin(), and the URL 'http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is saved to the user's Documents folder and then executed using os.startfile().",
  "flows": "Username is used to construct the file path; the URL is fetched via requests.get() and written to the file; the file is then executed with os.startfile().",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to an external server hosting an executable with a name suggestive of a 'checker' tool. The code automatically downloads and executes this file without user confirmation. The use of os.startfile() to run an executable directly is suspicious. Also, the script does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The script collects the current user's login name and constructs a path to save a file in their Documents folder. It then downloads an executable from a hardcoded IP address, which is not a reputable source, and executes it immediately. The lack of validation or user prompt indicates potential malicious intent, such as remote command execution, malware deployment, or system compromise. The code functions as a dropper or downloader for potentially malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads an executable from an external IP and runs it automatically, which is a common behavior for malware or remote access trojans. The absence of validation and the nature of the URL strongly suggest malicious intent.",
