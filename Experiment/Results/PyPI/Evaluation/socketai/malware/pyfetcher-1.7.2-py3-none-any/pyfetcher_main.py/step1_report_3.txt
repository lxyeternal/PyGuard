{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an executable file from a specified remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe' and the system username via os.getlogin()",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded content to disk and executing it with os.startfile()",
  "flows": "Source URL -> download() function -> save to user's Documents folder -> launch() function -> execute the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a remote server and immediately executes it without any verification, which is suspicious. The URL is hardcoded and points to an external IP. The code does not validate the download or check the file integrity. The filename 'netflix_checker_cache.exe' suggests potential for malware or unwanted software.",
  "analysis": "The script uses os.getlogin() to obtain the current username, then constructs a path in the user's Documents folder. It downloads an executable from a remote IP address and saves it to this path. Immediately after, it launches the downloaded file using os.startfile(), which will execute the file without any security checks. The use of a fixed URL pointing to an external IP and direct execution indicates malicious intent or at least high risk, as it resembles typical behavior of malware loaders or trojans. There is no verification, no user prompt, and no validation of the downloaded file, increasing the risk of malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, as it downloads and automatically executes a remote executable without verification. This behavior is characteristic of malware distribution or supply chain attacks, posing significant security risks.",
