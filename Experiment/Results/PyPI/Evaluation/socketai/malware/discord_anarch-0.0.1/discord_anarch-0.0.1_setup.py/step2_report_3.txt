  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The logic and code are standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Although the description and keywords suggest potential malicious intent (\"nuker\", \"video stream\"), the code itself is a plain setup script with no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The suspicion is based on metadata, not code behavior. The code remains benign. The securityRisk score is somewhat elevated due to the description, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, the code is a standard setup script, with metadata hinting at possible malicious uses but no actual malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; the package description alone does not imply actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard setup code, no suspicious code, just metadata suggesting potential misuse.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No actual malicious code; the risk is inferred from the description.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation, malware, or suspicious logic.\n- **Metadata suspicion:** The description and keywords hint at potentially malicious uses (\"nuker\", \"video stream\"), but this is only metadata, not code behavior.\n- **Malware risk:** No evidence of malware in the code itself.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to metadata, but not justified by code behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across all reports; no malicious code detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of malicious code, the risk score should be very low, ideally close to 0. The small risk scores assigned are mainly due to metadata implications, but since this is a code review, the actual code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe provided code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The suspicion arises solely from the package description and keywords, which do not reflect actual code behavior.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for metadata suspicion, but minimal in actual code terms)\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that metadata alone does not constitute malicious activity; actual code behavior is the critical factor.",
