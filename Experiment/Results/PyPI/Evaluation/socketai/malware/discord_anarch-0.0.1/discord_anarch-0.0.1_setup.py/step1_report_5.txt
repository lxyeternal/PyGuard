{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'discord_anarch' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; code is static configuration for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects execution or leaks; no data processing or external output beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A — static setup script without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard setup configuration without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, and requirements. It uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The dependencies listed are common Python packages and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no code injections, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code flows. Overall, this is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious code or anomalies.",
