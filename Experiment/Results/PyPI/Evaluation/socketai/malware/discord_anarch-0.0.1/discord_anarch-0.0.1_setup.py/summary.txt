  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The suspicion arises solely from metadata (description and keywords), not from code behavior. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1). The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary."
