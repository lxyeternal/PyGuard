  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies list, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or environment variable manipulation. Dependencies are common libraries, and the code does not contain any obfuscated or malicious logic. Metadata suggests potential misuse, but this is not reflected in the code itself. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is present. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.1), justified by metadata indicating possible malicious intent, but not supported by code analysis. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The suspicion arises solely from metadata (description and keywords), not from code behavior. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1). The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
