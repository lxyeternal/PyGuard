  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue present?** Yes, the code only imports 'nukebot' from 'discord_ghost'. No execution or further code shown.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes that import alone doesn't confirm malicious intent, but the name 'nukebot' suggests potential for harm.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.3, malware 0.2, securityRisk 0.4. These seem reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low malware score is appropriate because no code execution is demonstrated. The risk score is moderate, reflecting suspicion but no active malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue present?** Yes, similar to report 1, with added emphasis on the high suspicion due to naming.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report emphasizes that the naming 'nukebot' and 'discord_ghost' imply malicious intent, which is valid.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, malware 0.6, securityRisk 0.75. These are higher, reflecting increased suspicion.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** The reasoning is sound; the naming suggests malicious intent, and the high confidence is justified.\n- **Overall:** Scores are consistent with the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue present?** Yes, similar to previous, with high suspicion.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report maintains that the import hints at malicious intent, which is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0.75, securityRisk 0.75. These are high but justified based on the naming conventions.\n- **Justification:** Given the package and function names, the scores are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue present?** Yes, consistent with prior reports.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly notes that the import suggests potential harm but no active malicious code is shown.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, malware 0.6, securityRisk 0.7. These are reasonable.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue present?** Yes, similar to others.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly interprets the import as potentially malicious, based on naming.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, malware 0.5, securityRisk 0.5. These are moderate, reflecting suspicion but no direct evidence.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that only an import statement is present; no code execution or behavior is demonstrated.\n- **Malware scores:** They are generally aligned with the suspicion level based on naming conventions and package context.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports show 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, but all are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The high scores (malware > 0.5) are justified given the naming conventions and potential for malicious intent, especially if 'nukebot' is used later in the code.\n- The confidence scores are also appropriate, reflecting the suspicion based solely on import statements and naming.\n\n### Final estimate:\n\nGiven the consistency across reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.65** — The naming strongly suggests malicious capabilities, and while no code is executed here, the potential is high.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** **0.7** — The potential for harm is high based on naming and context, warranting a high risk score.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate. The main concern is the potential misuse of 'nukebot' if invoked later, which warrants a high malware and risk score.",
