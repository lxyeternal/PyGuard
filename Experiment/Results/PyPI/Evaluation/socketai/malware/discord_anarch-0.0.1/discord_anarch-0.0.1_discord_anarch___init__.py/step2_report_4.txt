  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on a single import statement: `from discord_ghost import nukebot`.\n- The main concern is the potential malicious intent implied by the name 'nukebot' and the package 'discord_ghost'.\n- No code beyond the import statement is provided, so actual execution or behavior cannot be confirmed.\n- The scores assigned vary but generally reflect suspicion due to naming conventions and potential for destructive actions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The import statement is syntactically correct and present in all reports.\n- The 'nukebot' component, by its name, suggests destructive or disruptive capabilities, especially in the context of Discord.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports assume malicious intent based primarily on naming conventions without concrete evidence of behavior.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are high but should be justified by actual code or behavior, which is absent here.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.7-0.8), which might be overstated given the lack of further context.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware scores** range from 0.2 to 0.75, often justified by the name 'nukebot'. However, without actual code execution or further details, these should be lower or at least more conservative.\n- The **security risk scores** are similarly high but should be adjusted to reflect that only the import statement is present.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores should be adjusted downward** unless additional code demonstrates malicious behavior.\n- The **malware score** should be **closer to 0.2-0.3** unless there's evidence of actual malicious code.\n- The **security risk score** should be **around 0.3-0.4** based solely on this import.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0 across all reports, which is reasonable given the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **malware** potential is **low to moderate** at this stage, mainly based on the component name.\n- The **risk** is **moderate**, primarily due to the potential for misuse if the 'nukebot' functions are invoked.\n- The **obfuscated** score remains 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0.2 - 0.3**     | Only import; no evidence of malicious code execution.       |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**           | Clear code; no obfuscation present.                          |\n| Risk             | **0.3 - 0.4**     | Potential for harm if 'nukebot' functions are used maliciously, but no active behavior shown. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the naming and context suggest caution, the absence of actual code execution or further details means that these scores should be conservative. Further investigation into the 'discord_ghost' package and the 'nukebot' component is recommended before making definitive security judgments.",
