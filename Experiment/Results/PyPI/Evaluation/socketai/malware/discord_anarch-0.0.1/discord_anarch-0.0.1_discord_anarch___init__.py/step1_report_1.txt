  "purpose": "Import the 'nukebot' function or class from the 'discord_ghost' package, likely for executing or controlling Discord-related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'discord_ghost' package",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'nukebot' which could perform harmful actions if invoked",
  "flows": "Import from 'discord_ghost' → usage of 'nukebot' in code (not shown)",
  "anomalies": "Only import statement present; no further code or invocation shown. The name 'nukebot' suggests potential for malicious or destructive behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'nukebot' from 'discord_ghost' with no additional logic or function calls. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent; however, the name 'nukebot' implies that if executed, it could perform destructive actions on Discord servers or users. Without further context or code, it’s not possible to determine if malicious behavior is intended. The package 'discord_ghost' may be legitimate or malicious depending on its content, but based solely on this line, the risk is uncertain.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports a potentially dangerous component called 'nukebot' from 'discord_ghost'. The name suggests malicious functionality, but no such behavior is demonstrated in this snippet. The actual risk depends on whether 'nukebot' is used and how it is implemented.",
