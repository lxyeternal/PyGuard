  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logical consistency, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports are based solely on an import statement: `from discord_ghost import nukebot`.\n- No subsequent code or invocation is shown.\n- The component name `nukebot` and the package `discord_ghost` strongly suggest malicious intent, but no actual malicious activity is demonstrated in these snippets.\n- The confidence levels and malware scores are generally high, reflecting suspicion based on naming conventions, but without concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code snippet **only** imports `nukebot` from `discord_ghost`. There is no evidence of any malicious activity, function calls, or payload execution in the provided code.\n- **No actual malicious behavior** is demonstrated in the snippet itself; suspicion is based solely on naming.\n\n### Flaws or logical mistakes in the reports:\n- Many reports assign high malware and security risk scores based purely on the import statement and the component names. While these names are suspicious, without actual code execution or behavior, this remains speculative.\n- The reports do not consider that the package could be benign or that the component might be used harmlessly elsewhere.\n- The confidence levels are high (up to 0.8), which may overstate the certainty given the lack of behavioral evidence.\n\n### Score analysis and suggestions:\n- **Malware score:** Should be lower unless there's evidence of malicious code or behavior. The current scores (0.2 to 0.75) seem inflated given only an import statement.\n- **Security risk:** Similarly, should be moderated unless further context indicates harmful activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly low at 0, as there's no obfuscation visible.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- High scores are justified **if** there is concrete evidence of malicious code or behavior. Since none is provided, these scores should be **reduced** to reflect the uncertainty.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware scores** (0.2 to 0.75) are inconsistent with the evidence. They should be **closer to 0.1-0.2** unless further context is provided.\n- The **security risk** scores (0.4 to 0.75) are similarly inflated. They should be **around 0.1-0.3** based solely on an import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.1 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal risk based on current info)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are overly suspicious based solely on naming conventions and the import statement. Without further code, behavior, or context, these scores should be significantly lowered. The actual risk appears minimal at this stage.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Re-evaluate the scores in the reports, lowering malware and risk scores to reflect the lack of concrete malicious activity.\n- Continue monitoring for subsequent code that uses `nukebot` before assigning higher scores.\n\n**Note:** Always consider that malicious behavior is only confirmed when code execution or payload delivery is observed, not just from import statements or naming.",
