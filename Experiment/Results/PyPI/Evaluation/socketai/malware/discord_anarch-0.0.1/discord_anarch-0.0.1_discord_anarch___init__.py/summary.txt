  "conclusion": "The import statement suggests potential risk based on naming, but no evidence of malicious activity is demonstrated in the snippet. Scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of concrete behavior, with malware around 0.4-0.5 and security risk similarly moderated. Further analysis of the actual 'nukebot' implementation is recommended before making definitive security judgments."
