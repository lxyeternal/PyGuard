      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The suspicion arises solely from metadata (description and keywords), not from code behavior. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1). The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The import statement suggests potential risk based on naming, but no evidence of malicious activity is demonstrated in the snippet. Scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of concrete behavior, with malware around 0.4-0.5 and security risk similarly moderated. Further analysis of the actual 'nukebot' implementation is recommended before making definitive security judgments."

      "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, exhibiting clear malware behavior through remote code execution, persistence, and server sabotage capabilities. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score remains 0, and the security risk score should be 1, reflecting its dangerous nature."
