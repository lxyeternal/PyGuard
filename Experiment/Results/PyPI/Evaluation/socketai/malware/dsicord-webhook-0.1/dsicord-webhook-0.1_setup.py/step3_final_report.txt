{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup script containing complex calculations, dynamic imports, and system modifications indicative of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, environment variables, performs complex numeric and string manipulations, imports modules like pip, ctypes, win32com, and accesses system APIs.",
  "sinks": "Imports pip and executes pip.main(), creates shortcuts via Dispatch, manipulates files and directories, checks admin privileges, executes system commands, and modifies environment variables.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated calculations generate strings and control flow, leading to system modifications, privilege escalation, and potential malicious payload execution based on conditional logic.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex bitwise and arithmetic operations, dynamic string generation, suspicious module imports, privilege checks, and system modifications designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is intentionally obfuscated with complex calculations and dynamic imports to conceal malicious behaviors such as privilege escalation, system sabotage, backdoor setup, and data exfiltration. It manipulates files, creates shortcuts, and performs system API calls in suspicious contexts. The heavy obfuscation and conditional execution based on obscure constants strongly suggest malicious intent, with the overall behavior aligning with sabotage or malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation and system-level manipulations typical of malware, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. It should be classified as highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, warranting further static and dynamic analysis. Deployment or execution is strongly discouraged.",
