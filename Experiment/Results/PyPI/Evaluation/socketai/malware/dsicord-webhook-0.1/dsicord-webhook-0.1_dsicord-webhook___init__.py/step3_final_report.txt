  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, network operations, utility functions, authentication routines, data processing functions, and code snippets within the dependency.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication points, dynamic code execution, and input handling functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, network data) to processing functions, possibly leading to network transmission or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity confirmed, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads detected; some reports note ambiguous network activity but no definitive malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, and significant security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.3), reflecting cautious but justified concern given ambiguous network activity in some cases. Confidence levels are high where code is benign, slightly lower in ambiguous cases. No discrepancies or overestimations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, with scores appropriately reflecting the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
