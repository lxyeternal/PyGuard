{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for handling user authentication and managing session data within a web application.",
  "sources": "Input from user forms (e.g., username, password), environment variables for configuration",
  "sinks": "Database queries, session storage, network requests for authentication validation",
  "flows": "User input → Validation functions → Database queries or session management → Response back to user",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual data leaks or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles user data, validates inputs, interacts with a database for authentication, and manages sessions. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. Usage of standard libraries and secure practices appears consistent. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert network activity are observed. The code structure is clear and follows common security guidelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of user authentication and session management without any detectable malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe based on the provided code fragment.",
