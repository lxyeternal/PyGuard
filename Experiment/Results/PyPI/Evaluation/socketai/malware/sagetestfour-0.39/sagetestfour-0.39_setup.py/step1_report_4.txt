{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package and performs additional post-installation actions, including creating directories and cloning malicious repositories to the user's startup folder.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getlogin()), user directories, and external URLs for cloning repositories.",
  "sinks": "It writes to system directories (startup folder, Powerpoint folder), moves files into startup, and executes git clone commands that can lead to persistence or malware execution.",
  "flows": "User directories are used as input sources; cloned repositories and moved scripts are potential malicious payloads executed or persistent on startup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes cloning remote repositories into startup directories, creating hidden folders, and moving scripts into startup to achieve persistence. Use of environment variables for directory paths and cloning repositories without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, creates folders in the Windows startup directory and other locations. It clones two repositories from GitHub into startup and Powerpoint folders, which could be used to deploy malicious payloads. Moving a script ('test.py') into the startup directory suggests persistence mechanisms. The code leverages environment variables to customize paths, making it adaptable to different user environments. The use of cloning repositories directly into startup folders and executing potentially malicious scripts indicates malicious intent. There are no obfuscation techniques or benign reasons for such actions in a legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by establishing persistence via startup folder injections and cloning repositories that could contain harmful payloads. Its actions are suspicious and indicate potential malware functionality aimed at system compromise.",
