  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to clone specific repositories and move files into startup directories to enable automatic execution upon system startup.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), os.path.join(), git.Git.clone()",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs(), os.rename(), cloning repositories into startup directories",
  "flows": "Retrieving user login -> creating directories -> cloning repositories into startup folders -> moving files into startup",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories directly into startup folders, moving a script into startup directory, no user consent prompts, no clear purpose or documentation for these actions, use of potentially suspicious repository URLs",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional actions during package installation. It creates startup folders, clones repositories into these folders, and moves a script into the startup directory. These actions facilitate persistence by executing code automatically on system startup. The repositories cloned are from suspicious URLs, and the process involves executing potentially unknown code without user consent. There are no safeguards or notifications, which is typical of malicious or undesirable activity. The overall behavior indicates an intent to establish persistence, potentially for malicious purposes, without clear legitimate context.",
  "conclusion": "This code establishes persistence by cloning repositories and moving scripts into startup directories, potentially enabling automated execution without user consent. The suspicious repository URLs and the manipulative file operations suggest malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The overall security risk is high, and caution is strongly advised.",
