      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation. The obfuscation, stealthy execution, and suspicious URL support a high malware and security risk assessment. It should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
