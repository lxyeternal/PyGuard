{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also performs a custom post-installation step involving data exfiltration and possibly malicious payload download.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers, writing and executing a downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') with os.system, which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request to a remote server; concurrently, a malicious executable is downloaded and launched on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code unconditionally sends data based on environment variable; downloads and executes a suspicious executable during installation; suppresses exceptions silently; uses a non-standard URL that appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL, indicating possible data exfiltration. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently, which could execute malicious payloads. The setup process includes this 'send' function as part of a post-install step. The use of silent exception handling hides errors, making malicious activity less detectable. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, such as data theft and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution via a downloaded executable. It is highly suspicious and should not be used.",
