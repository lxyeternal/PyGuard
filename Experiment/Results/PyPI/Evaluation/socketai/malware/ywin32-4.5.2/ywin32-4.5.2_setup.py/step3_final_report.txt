{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to an external server, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; HTTP GET requests to external URLs; download of executable file; execution of downloaded file via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending system info to external server; downloading and executing remote payload; running external executable with os.system.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sending data via requests.get -> downloading executable -> executing downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling suppresses errors; downloading and executing a file during package installation; use of suspicious URLs; silent remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network communication to exfiltrate system info, downloads a potentially malicious executable, and executes it silently during package installation. The straightforward code structure lacks obfuscation. The broad exception handling is suspicious, designed to hide errors. The URLs used are suspicious and indicate malicious activity. The execution of external payloads during setup poses a high security risk. The behavior aligns with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution and data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (0.9 or 1 for malware and security risk, 0 for obfuscation) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious activity, including data exfiltration, remote payload download, and execution during installation. It should be assigned a malware score of 1, a risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score of 0. The behavior is highly dangerous and warrants immediate caution and removal from repositories.",
