{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package named 'ywin32'. It also executes a custom post-installation step that performs network communication and downloads/executed a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and downloads a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system(), which runs the executable on the host system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to 'linkedopports.com' -> Download of 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' -> Execution of the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network communication without user consent, downloads an executable file during installation, and automatically executes it without validation. The URL domains appear suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of os.system() for executing downloaded content is risky and indicative of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function. This function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain with the environment info. It then downloads an executable from a potentially malicious URL and executes it without verification. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send' function during package installation. The setup configuration specifies package details but does not mitigate the malicious activities embedded in the post-install script. The behavior indicates an attempt to contact a remote server, download, and execute malicious code during installation, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by automatic network communication, downloading, and executing a remote executable during package installation. These actions constitute a security risk and suggest malware activity. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
