{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'installed' and executes it immediately, serving as a basic indicator or status message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code with no data sources.",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print statement.",
  "flows": "Function call from definition to execution, with output directed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and static. It contains no external data handling, no network activity, and no malicious constructs. The function is called immediately after definition, resulting in a simple print statement. There are no signs of code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code's behavior is benign and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
