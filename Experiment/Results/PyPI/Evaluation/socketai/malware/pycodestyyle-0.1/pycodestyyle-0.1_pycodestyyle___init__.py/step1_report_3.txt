  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet appears to be either empty or incomplete. No code content is present to analyze for malicious behavior or security issues. Since the input lacks any functional code, no source, sink, or flow can be identified, nor are any anomalies detectable. Given the absence of code, it is not possible to evaluate potential malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is empty or incomplete; no malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation can be assessed. Additional code is required for a thorough review.",
