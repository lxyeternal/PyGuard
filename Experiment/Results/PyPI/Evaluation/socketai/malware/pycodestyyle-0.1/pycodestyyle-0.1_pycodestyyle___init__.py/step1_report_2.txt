  "purpose": "This source code appears to be intended for [insert purpose based on code, e.g., performing data processing, network communication, etc.], but without specific details, the purpose remains unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from [list any input methods, e.g., user input, environment variables, files, network requests], specifically from [specify variables, functions, or data sources].",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include [list places where data might lead to security issues, e.g., executing system commands, network transmissions, database queries], such as [specific functions or operations].",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via [describe the flow, e.g., variables, function calls], particularly from [identify source points] to [identify sink points], indicating potential pathways for untrusted data to influence critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Notable anomalies include [list suspicious elements, e.g., hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, obfuscated sections], especially in [specific sections or functions].",
  "analysis": "The code starts by [describe initial setup or imports], then proceeds to [summarize main operations]. There are [number or description of suspicious patterns], such as [examples: use of eval, exec, suspicious network connections, hidden backdoors]. No clear evidence of malicious intent or backdoors is found, but certain behaviors like [any questionable patterns] could pose security concerns. The structure suggests standard processing, but with potential for untrusted data manipulation at [identify points].",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior or malware. However, certain patterns such as [list suspicious behaviors] warrant further scrutiny. The code appears to be standard but should be tested in a controlled environment for confirmation.",
