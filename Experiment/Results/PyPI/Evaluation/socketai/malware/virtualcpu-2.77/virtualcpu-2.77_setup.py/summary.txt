  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the embedded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup. The current reports' assessments and scores are appropriate; I would assign a malware score of approximately 0.75, an obfuscation score of about 0.85, and a security risk of around 0.8, reflecting a high likelihood of malicious intent pending further decoding."
