{
  "purpose": "Detects and assesses potential malicious behavior in a Python package, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution and external contact.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of Base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess when 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing obfuscated PowerShell command; external URL 'esquelesquad.rip' embedded in payload.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check ('tahg') → conditional execution of obfuscated PowerShell command → potential external contact or payload delivery.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; contact with suspicious external domain; broad try-except blocks suppress errors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, runs a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64, contacting 'esquelesquad.rip'. Silent error handling conceals failures. The setup() function appears legitimate but is likely a cover. The obfuscation, external contact, and stealthy execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.9) are justified given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, contacting an external server. The behavior indicates high malicious potential, warranting classification as malicious with high confidence.",
