  "purpose": "Simple script to indicate installation status",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static print statement",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no inputs, external data, network operations, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign script with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
