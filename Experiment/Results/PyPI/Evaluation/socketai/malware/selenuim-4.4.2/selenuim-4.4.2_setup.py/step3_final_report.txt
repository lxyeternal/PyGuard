{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates environment data, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; HTTP GET request to external URL; downloading executable file; executing external file with os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending environment info to external server; executing downloaded malicious executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> data sent via HTTP GET -> download executable -> execute executable with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block masking errors; downloading and executing unverified external payload during installation; suspicious URLs unrelated to package purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activities: it exfiltrates environment data, downloads, and executes an untrusted executable during installation. The URLs are suspicious, and the execution occurs silently, indicating malicious behavior. The code is straightforward without obfuscation. The use of os.system to run external code without validation poses high security risks. The behavior aligns with typical malware patterns, justifying maximum malware and security risk scores. The code's intent is clear, and no false positives are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains explicit malicious behavior involving data exfiltration and remote code execution. The scores of malware: 1, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 1 are justified. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
