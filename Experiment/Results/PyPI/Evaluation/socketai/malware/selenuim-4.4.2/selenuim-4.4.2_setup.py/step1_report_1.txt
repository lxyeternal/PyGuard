{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'selenuim' with minimal dependencies and includes a custom install command that executes additional code after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'send()' function reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and makes HTTP requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'send()' function downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it via 'os.system'. It also sends data via an HTTP GET request containing environment information.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote URL. If on Windows, an external executable is downloaded and launched with 'os.system', potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code forcibly contacts external sites to send environment info and downloads and executes a file from an untrusted source during installation. The URL 'linkedopports.com' appears suspicious and unrelated to the package purpose. The use of 'try-except' without error handling masks failures.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a function 'send()' that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and transmits it to a suspicious URL. On Windows, it downloads an executable from 'python-release.com' and executes it, which is highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious activity. The setup process triggers this 'send()' function during installation via a custom command class. The URLs used are unrelated to the package purpose and are likely malicious. The code does not contain any legitimate functionality, only these potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data and executing an external, possibly malicious executable during installation. These activities indicate likely malicious intent with high risk and potential for harm.",
