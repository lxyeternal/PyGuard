{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'selenuim' package, including custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs in send() function, request responses, and system commands execution.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing downloaded files, and system call 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> request to linkedopports.com and python-release.com -> file download and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically contacts external servers upon installation, downloads an executable, and executes it without user consent or verification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send()' that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious domain, appends the environment variable to the URL. It proceeds to download an executable file from a second suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. This behavior is embedded within a custom installation command, triggering during package installation. Such behavior can facilitate remote command and control, malware delivery, or data exfiltration. The code does not verify the downloaded content, nor does it seek user approval, indicating malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present; the malicious behavior is evident through network activity and file execution.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by automatically contacting external servers, downloading, and executing an executable during installation. This indicates a high likelihood of malware, potentially used for malicious purposes such as remote control or payload delivery.",
