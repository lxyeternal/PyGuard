{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'selenuim' and includes a post-installation step that executes a function intended to perform remote communication and download a file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetching data from 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', downloading and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system' to run downloaded file, sending HTTP GET request with environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to remote server for data; remote server response triggers download of executable -> 'os.system' executes downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of code that contacts external servers, sends environment info, downloads and executes an external file without user consent, which is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain, then downloads and executes a file from another suspicious domain if on Windows platform. This behavior is hidden within the post-install command, which triggers on package installation. The use of 'os.system' to execute a downloaded file is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating code intended to run arbitrary executable code on the user's system. The remote server URLs are suspicious and do not relate to legitimate package functions. Overall, the code exhibits malicious intent, including remote data exfiltration and executing downloaded malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by contacting external servers, exfiltrating environment information, downloading, and executing a potentially malicious executable during package installation. These actions strongly suggest malicious intent and security risks.",
