{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'selenuim' with a custom post-installation script that performs network requests and potentially executes a downloaded file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and the downloaded file 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe'",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) which executes a potentially malicious executable downloaded from the internet",
  "flows": "The code reads environment variables, performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs, downloads an executable file, and then executes it via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending environment info to an external server, downloading an executable from an untrusted source, and immediately executing it without validation",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to retrieve the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this info to a remote URL. It also downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain and executes it without verification. The presence of a custom post-install command that triggers these actions during package installation indicates malicious intent, as it can silently execute harmful code on the user's machine.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by contacting external servers, exfiltrating environment info, downloading, and executing a potentially harmful executable. The use of 'os.system' to run downloaded content without validation confirms malicious intent.",
