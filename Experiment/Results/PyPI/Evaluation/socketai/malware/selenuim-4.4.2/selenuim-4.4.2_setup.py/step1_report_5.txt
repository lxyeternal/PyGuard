{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'selenuim' with installation procedures that include a custom post-installation script.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP requests to external URLs, and executes system commands to run downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains, downloading and executing an external executable file, and launching it via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ' + env -> download of 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' -> execution of downloaded file with 'start' command.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variable to craft a URL request, downloads an executable from a suspicious domain, and executes it automatically during installation. The external domains appear suspicious, and the code actively executes downloaded content without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script includes a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it without any validation or user consent, which indicates malicious intent. The function is called during the custom installation process, meaning every install of this package triggers this potentially harmful behavior. The code's structure suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data and execute arbitrary code, which are common malicious tactics. No legitimate package behavior or benign functionality is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing remote payloads during installation. It appears designed for supply chain attack or backdoor purposes. The package should not be used.",
