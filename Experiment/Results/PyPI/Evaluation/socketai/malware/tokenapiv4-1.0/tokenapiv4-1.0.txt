      "conclusion": "The provided code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal data. It decrypts stored credentials, exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, terminates processes to access protected files, and employs threading for efficiency. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, silent dependency installation, and process termination commands confirm its malicious nature. The code's structure indicates low obfuscation, but its behaviors are consistent with malware designed for system compromise and data theft."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex terminal utility library designed for styling and animations, with no malicious behavior detected. The minor incomplete features and placeholders do not affect security. The potential for resource exhaustion exists if functions like animations are misused, but this is a known risk rather than malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
