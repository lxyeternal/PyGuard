{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal data, then exfiltrate it via webhooks and upload to file sharing services. It also includes functionality to extract data from browsers and other applications, compress data, and upload it to external servers.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from user files, browser storage directories, local SQLite databases (e.g., Chrome/Firefox login data and cookies), and process memory. It also extracts tokens and credentials from specific file patterns and memory patterns.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data to a Discord webhook, uploads files to anonymous file-sharing services (gofile.io, transfer.sh), and executes external commands to manipulate or kill processes. Sensitive data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal info are transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser storage, logs, local files, and process memory to sinks such as webhooks and file uploads. For example, tokens and cookies are extracted from local databases, decrypted, and then sent to the webhook or uploaded files. Browser data like passwords and cookies flow into internal lists before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The script includes unusual behaviors such as automated installation of Python modules, bypassing user interaction, killing processes, creating ZIP archives of user files, and encoding data for exfiltration. It attempts to hide its activities via threading, obfuscates some variable usage, and contains commented-out code for alternative upload methods. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs, suspicious directory scans, and process termination commands are notable.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to stealthily access browser data (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Yandex), Discord-related files, and other application data (Steam, wallets). It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows API functions, indicating it targets Windows systems specifically. It then gathers tokens and personal info from Discord APIs, checks token validity, and collects additional user info (email, Nitro, badges). It automates the download of data and then uploads or sends this information via webhooks and file uploads. It kills processes related to known browsers or applications to access locked files, then zips and uploads data. The code also includes functions for data collection from file paths, threading for concurrent operations, and attempts to evade detection with obfuscation and hiding activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates multiple malicious behaviors: it is a data stealer targeting Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal files; it exfiltrates data via webhooks and file sharing services; it kills processes to access locked files; and it includes mechanisms for obfuscation and evasion. It is clearly designed for malicious purposes such as credential theft, privacy invasion, and system compromise.",
