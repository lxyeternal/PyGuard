{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal information from browsers, Discord, and other applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and upload to external file hosting services. It also includes functionality to scan user directories for specific files related to passwords, wallets, and other sensitive data, and zips certain files for transfer.",
  "sources": "It reads user input and data from browser storage directories, browser login databases, Discord files, logs, and local state files. It also captures network data like IP and geolocation via URL requests.",
  "sinks": "It sends collected data to external webhooks and file hosting services (requests.post, urlopen). It also executes commands to kill processes, installs dependencies, and writes data to temporary files, which are then uploaded.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local browser and application data directories into parsing functions that extract tokens, passwords, cookies, etc. Extracted tokens are validated and uploaded. Sensitive information is aggregated into JSON payloads and transmitted over HTTP requests to remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of functions that install dependencies automatically, kill processes, and perform file zipping and uploading with external services. The code actively disables security (e.g., killing processes), uses obfuscated or misleading variable names, and employs multiple threading to perform operations asynchronously. There are hardcoded webhooks and links, and the code contains functions that exfiltrate tokens, cookies, passwords, and files. The script includes mechanisms to avoid detection and maximize data theft efficiency.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a malware-like information stealer, targeting browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, Telegram, and wallet applications. It extracts tokens, cookies, passwords, and files, then sends this data via Discord webhooks and uploads files to external hosting. It also scans user directories for specific keywords related to credentials, crypto wallets, and accounts, compresses files, and uploads them. The code dynamically installs required libraries, terminates processes to prevent interference, and uses threading for concurrent operations. It manipulates local application data, decrypts stored credentials, and actively exfiltrates sensitive data. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, process termination commands, and extensive data exfiltration routines strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed to stealthily steal user tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate this data through external webhooks and file hosts. It employs obfuscation tactics, forcibly terminates processes, installs dependencies automatically, and performs extensive directory scans for sensitive files. Its purpose aligns with malicious data theft and surveillance, making it highly dangerous and unsuitable for legitimate use.",
