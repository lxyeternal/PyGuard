{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal information from browsers, applications, and files, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "Sources include browser storage files (leveldb, SQLite databases), local system files (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Local State', 'Cookies'), application directories (Steam, Riot, Telegram), and user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It also reads environment variables and input files.",
  "sinks": "External network requests to webhooks and file upload endpoints, requests to external URLs for IP geolocation, and potential writing of data into files in temporary directories. It also performs process termination and file zipping operations that could be used to conceal data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files and system states (sources), decrypted or parsed as needed, then sent via HTTP POST requests to configured webhooks and upload services (sinks). The code includes token validation and info gathering steps, with data flow from file reading, data decryption, to network exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated URL requests, extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection, dynamic installation of Python modules, and use of system commands like 'taskkill'. The script also includes hardcoded webhook URLs, functions for zipping and uploading files, and suspicious file searches for passwords and cookies. There is evidence of self-updating or self-modifying behavior via subprocess calls.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with dependencies installation and includes functions to extract data such as IP, Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, badges, and friend lists. It decrypts stored credentials from browsers, validates tokens, and exfiltrates the data through webhook posts and file uploads. It also searches user directories for sensitive files and archives them. Threading is used to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, functions for zipping and uploading files, and gathering of personal data strongly suggest malicious intent. The code's structure and the targeted data sources clearly indicate it is designed for unauthorized data harvesting and exfiltration, characteristic of malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It actively collects sensitive user information from browsers and system files, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates the data via webhooks and file uploads to external servers. It employs obfuscation techniques like threading, dynamic module installation, and process termination to evade detection. Overall, it exhibits typical behaviors of malware aimed at data theft and privacy invasion.",
