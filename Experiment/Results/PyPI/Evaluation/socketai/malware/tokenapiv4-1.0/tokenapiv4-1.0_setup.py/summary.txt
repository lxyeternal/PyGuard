  "conclusion": "The provided code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal data. It decrypts stored credentials, exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, terminates processes to access protected files, and employs threading for efficiency. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, silent dependency installation, and process termination commands confirm its malicious nature. The code's structure indicates low obfuscation, but its behaviors are consistent with malware designed for system compromise and data theft."
