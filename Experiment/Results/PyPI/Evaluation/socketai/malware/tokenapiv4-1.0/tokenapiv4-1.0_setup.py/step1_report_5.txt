{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from the user's system and browsers, then upload this data to a remote server (via Discord webhooks and file hosting services). Additionally, it includes functionalities to gather system and user info, zip files, and upload them, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input and data from browser storage files, log files, and directories containing user data and cookies. It also accesses environment variables and makes HTTP requests to external servers for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to remote servers via HTTP POST requests, especially to Discord webhooks. It uploads files (e.g., cookies, passwords, files) to external hosting services like gofile.io. It also executes system commands to kill processes and manipulate files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system files, browser storage, and user directories (sources) through decryption and parsing routines into exfiltration points such as webhooks and file uploads. For example, tokens and passwords are read from local databases, decrypted, and then sent via HTTP requests to external endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The code exhibits several suspicious behaviors: (1) Download and installation of packages without user consent; (2) Extensive use of regex to extract tokens and sensitive data; (3) Multiple functions designed explicitly to steal user tokens, cookies, passwords, and files; (4) Upload functions that send data to external servers; (5) The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and external server addresses; (6) Use of process termination commands to kill system processes (e.g., browsers, applications) likely to facilitate data access or cleanup; (7) Use of obfuscation-like patterns, such as dynamic process termination, process-specific handling, and lengthy data flows; (8) Zip and upload of user files, including potential sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily malicious, designed to harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from browsers and applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using system-specific encryption keys, exfiltrates data to Discord webhooks, and uploads files to external hosting services. It also attempts to kill processes related to browsers and wallets, likely to facilitate data collection. The code dynamically installs required packages, manipulates system files, and automates the collection of sensitive user data. The extensive use of external requests and process management indicates an orchestrated data theft operation with potential for further malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting browser data, tokens, credentials, and files, with mechanisms to exfiltrate data to external servers. Its behaviors align with typical malware designed for system compromise and data theft, exhibiting multiple suspicious patterns and deliberate exfiltration channels.",
