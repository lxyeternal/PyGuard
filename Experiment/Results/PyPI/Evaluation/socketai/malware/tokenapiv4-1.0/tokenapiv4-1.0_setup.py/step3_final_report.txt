{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info-stealer targeting browser data, tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal information. It decrypts stored credentials, collects user tokens, cookies, and passwords from various browsers and applications, and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads. Additionally, it terminates processes to access locked files, installs dependencies silently, and employs threading for concurrent operations, all aimed at maximizing data theft and evasion.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files (leveldb, SQLite), local state files, application directories (Discord, Steam, Telegram), environment variables, user directories, and system files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to hardcoded webhooks, URL open requests, file uploads to external servers, process termination commands, and local file writes.",
  "flows": "The script scans specified directories for browser and application data, extracts tokens, cookies, and passwords, decrypts encrypted credentials, then sends the collected data via webhooks or uploads. It also zips user files and uploads them, while terminating processes to access protected files. Threading is used to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent installation of modules via subprocess, process termination commands (`taskkill`), use of threading for parallelism, minimal obfuscation with variable names, and active data exfiltration routines. The code also performs dependency checks and installs modules if missing, which is unusual for malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple behaviors characteristic of malware: it decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs, collects tokens and personal data from browsers and applications, decrypts encrypted data, and exfiltrates this information via webhooks and uploads. It terminates processes to access locked files, employs threading for efficiency, and silently installs dependencies. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and process-killing commands further indicates malicious intent. The code structure is relatively straightforward, with some variable obfuscation, but no heavy encryption or packing, suggesting low obfuscation levels. Overall, the script is designed for extensive data theft, system manipulation, and evasion.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal data. It decrypts stored credentials, exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, terminates processes to access protected files, and employs threading for efficiency. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, silent dependency installation, and process termination commands confirm its malicious nature. The code's structure indicates low obfuscation, but its behaviors are consistent with malware designed for system compromise and data theft.",
