{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal manipulation, color handling, text formatting, animations, and UI components for terminal-based interfaces.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, time, threading, and ctypes; various functions accessing system info, environment, or executing system commands; user input and output functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses _system() to run shell commands; uses input() for user data; writes ANSI escape sequences directly to stdout; no apparent data sinks that leak untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "System commands flow from functions like Init(), Clear(), Title(), Size(), Command() to the system shell; user input flows into input() calls; color and formatting flow from static and dynamic color functions into stdout writes.",
  "anomalies": "Complex color mixing functions with no clear usage; some dynamic color definitions use placeholders like 'm;m;m' without implementation; code contains unused or incomplete dynamic color definitions (e.g., red_to_blue = ...); no actual malicious code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration detected; presence of commented/developer areas suggests incomplete or experimental code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides terminal manipulation utilities, color handling, and UI components with no evident malicious behavior. The functions for executing system commands (via _system) are standard and only used for system control (clear, title, size). No code injects or exfiltrates data, connects to external servers, or performs harmful actions. The dynamic color functions contain placeholders, indicating incomplete features but no malicious intent. No hidden backdoors, reverse shells, or data theft mechanisms are present. The only concerning aspect is the potential for misuse of system command functions if misused externally, but within this code, they are used for benign system control. Overall, the code is a collection of terminal UI utilities with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex terminal utility library focused on styling, animations, and system commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. Some incomplete dynamic color features and developer comments suggest ongoing development, but no harmful intent or security risks are evident.",
