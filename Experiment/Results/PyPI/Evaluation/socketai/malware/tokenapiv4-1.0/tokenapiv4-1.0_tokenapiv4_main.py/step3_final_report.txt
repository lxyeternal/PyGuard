  "purpose": "A comprehensive terminal styling, animation, and UI utility library for enhancing terminal interfaces with colors, animations, and system commands.",
  "sources": "Standard system info, user input, terminal size, and system commands via _system() and threading for input handling.",
  "sinks": "_system() calls for terminal control, stdout.write() for output, input() for user input, and threading for non-blocking input collection.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into input() functions; system commands execute via _system(); color functions generate ANSI sequences; animations update terminal display repeatedly.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholders ('...') indicating incomplete features; potential infinite loops in animation functions with 'time=True' which could cause resource exhaustion or hangs; incomplete dynamic color functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a terminal UI and styling toolkit with functions for colors, animations, and system control. No evidence of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Placeholders and incomplete functions suggest ongoing development but do not introduce malicious behavior. Infinite loops in animation routines could cause resource issues if misused but are typical for such visual effects. Use of system commands is controlled and for benign purposes. Threaded input handling is standard. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by potential misuse or resource impact, not active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex terminal utility library designed for styling and animations, with no malicious behavior detected. The minor incomplete features and placeholders do not affect security. The potential for resource exhaustion exists if functions like animations are misused, but this is a known risk rather than malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
