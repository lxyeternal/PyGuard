{
  "purpose": "This code provides a terminal manipulation and styling library, including functions for colors, text formatting, animations, and system commands, primarily aimed at enhancing terminal UI/UX.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user prompts (input()), environment details (os, sys), and terminal size queries (_terminal_size()), which are typical data sources for terminal applications.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via _system(), terminal control sequences for cursor visibility, and input/output streams. Potential sinks include execution of shell commands and manipulation of terminal display.",
  "flows": "User input flows through input() functions; terminal commands are sent to _system(); color and style data flow through color and formatting functions; animations and display functions manipulate terminal output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Some functions contain placeholder or incomplete implementations (e.g., DynamicRGB and color gradients) but do not perform malicious actions. The code for dynamic color creation and animations is complex but appears to be for visual effects rather than malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively manages terminal behavior, colors, cursor visibility, and animations. It uses system commands and terminal sequences in standard ways for terminal UI enhancement. The presence of complex color manipulations and animation routines could be for visual effects. No code explicitly connects to external malicious domains, leaks data, or executes unauthorized system modifications beyond typical terminal control. The use of threading for input collection appears safe within this context. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscated code is present. Overall, the code demonstrates advanced terminal control features without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a comprehensive terminal styling and animation library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard techniques for terminal manipulation and visual effects, with no hidden or suspicious actions detected.",
