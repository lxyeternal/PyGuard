  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex terminal utility library designed for styling and animations, with no malicious behavior detected. The minor incomplete features and placeholders do not affect security. The potential for resource exhaustion exists if functions like animations are misused, but this is a known risk rather than malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
