  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during package setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment of errors justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
