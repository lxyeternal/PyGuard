{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package 'ccpip' with metadata and dependencies, but includes a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory; the subprocess module executes the encoded PowerShell command as a sink.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command; the silent exception handling conceals errors.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially running malicious payloads silently during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window flags; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; obfuscation of the command; execution during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup but includes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command executed silently, which is suspicious. The obfuscation and silent error handling hide potential malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.8) are justified given the pattern of behavior. The command's purpose is unknown, but its obfuscated, silent execution during setup indicates high suspicion of malicious intent. The broad exception handling further conceals errors, increasing risk. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but the pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during package setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment of errors justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
