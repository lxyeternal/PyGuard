  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and executes embedded code that appears to be obfuscated, then terminates.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, and decoding base64-encoded code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code, potentially running malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> base64 decoding -> exec() -> execution of embedded code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed dynamically; the encoded string appears obfuscated and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with package setup using setuptools, which is normal. It then imports 'os' and checks for the existence of a specific path, exiting if found. The crucial part is the import of 'requests', 'tempfile', 'subprocess', and 'base64'. Following this, a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed via exec(). The decoded code likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is suspicious because such techniques are common in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The presence of dynamic code execution without clear purpose indicates a potential security risk. The script terminates immediately after executing this code, which is consistent with attempts to hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed payload via base64 decoding and exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The script could execute arbitrary code, posing significant security risks. The package setup itself appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious obfuscated code segment.",
