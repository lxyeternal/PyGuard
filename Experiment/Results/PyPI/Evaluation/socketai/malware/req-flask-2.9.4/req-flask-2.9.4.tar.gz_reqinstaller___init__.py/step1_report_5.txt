  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a specified URL and run it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe' which supplies the content to be downloaded.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call([exe_path]) which executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from the URL → writes content to a temporary file → subprocess.call() executes the file from the temporary location.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of the downloaded file without verification, no validation or sandboxing, and use of a public URL pointing to a potentially untrusted source.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a binary from a remote URL and directly executes it without any verification, validation, or user consent. This behavior is highly suspicious because it can facilitate malicious code execution. The use of tempfile ensures the file is stored temporarily, but the immediate execution without checks poses a significant security risk. There are no obfuscation techniques or complex logic, but the core pattern is typical of malicious behavior aimed at remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious due to its direct download and execution of an external executable without validation, indicative of malicious intent or at least unsafe practice. It is potentially dangerous and should be reviewed or blocked.",
