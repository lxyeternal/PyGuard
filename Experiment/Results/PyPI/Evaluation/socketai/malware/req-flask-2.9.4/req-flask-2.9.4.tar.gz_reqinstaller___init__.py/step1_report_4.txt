  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch data from a URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() to execute the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves content -> saves to temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads an executable from a remote source and runs it without validation or user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a file from a remote URL and executes it directly, which is highly suspicious and typical of malicious activity. No validation or integrity checks are performed before execution. The remote file appears to be an executable (.exe), and running it directly poses a high security risk, potentially executing malicious payloads. The code does not contain any obfuscation or misleading patterns but its behavior is inherently dangerous due to automatic execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without validation, indicative of malicious intent or supply chain attack. It should be flagged as highly dangerous and avoided.",
