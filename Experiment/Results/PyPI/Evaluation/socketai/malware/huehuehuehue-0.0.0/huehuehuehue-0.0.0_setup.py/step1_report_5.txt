{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'huehuehuehue' and then executes decoded base64-encoded malicious code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec()",
  "sinks": "The decoded code executes potentially malicious operations such as importing modules, network connections, or other harmful actions",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64, then executes the resulting code which may perform malicious activities like network communication or system modification",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded base64 content, obfuscated base64 string, no comments or documentation, and the lack of any meaningful functionality in the setup call",
  "analysis": "The script first performs a setuptools setup, which is legitimate. However, it then decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec(). The base64 string decodes to Python code involving socket connections, threading, time delays, and other modules. This pattern is typical of obfuscated malicious code designed to hide its intent. The decoding and execution of external code is a high-risk behavior, indicating possible malware. The code's structure and the encoding suggest an attempt to evade simple static analysis. The setup function appears legitimate, but the subsequent malicious code execution outweighs this.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, malicious code that executes after setup(), indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of exec() with decoded payload poses significant security risks, such as data exfiltration, remote control, or system compromise.",
