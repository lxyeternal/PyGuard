  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that appears to perform some base64 decoding and dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64 string decoded via __import__('base64').b64decode()",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing dynamically decoded code",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded data passed directly to exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded data; obfuscated code structure; encoded payload hiding behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools but then executes a base64-encoded string dynamically decoded and executed via exec(). The decoded payload, when de-obfuscated, is a Python script that imports socket, threading, base64, and time, and then runs an infinite loop, possibly a backdoor or malicious listener. The obfuscation and use of exec() on decoded data suggest malicious intent, likely a remote code execution or backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature and dynamic execution, indicating malicious intent likely to establish a backdoor or remote access. It is a security threat.",
