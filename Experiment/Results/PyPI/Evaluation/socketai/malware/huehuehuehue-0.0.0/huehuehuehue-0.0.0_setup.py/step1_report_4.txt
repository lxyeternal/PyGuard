{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with the name 'huehuehuehue' and then executes obfuscated code decoded from base64.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package setup parameters and the embedded base64-encoded string, which is decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "The decoded string is executed directly via exec(), potentially running arbitrary code, which is a significant sink.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, sets up package info, then decodes base64 data and executes it, which could lead to arbitrary behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded base64 data, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious payloads. The initial setup is straightforward but then followed by obfuscated code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setuptools setup, which is normal for Python package distribution. Immediately after, it decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec(). The base64-encoded payload, when decoded, is Python code that imports modules, creates a socket connection, and runs a subprocess, possibly to establish backdoors or perform malicious actions. The obfuscation and use of exec() on decoded data strongly suggest malicious intent or at least an attempt to conceal behavior. The presence of network and subprocess calls inside the decoded payload raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing obfuscated payload code that could establish unauthorized network connections and execute arbitrary commands. This pattern is typical of malicious package sabotage or backdoor installation. The initial setup code is benign, but the payload's decoding and execution indicate high malicious intent.",
