  "purpose": "Simple Python script defining and calling a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "The function ina() reads no external input; the print statement outputs static data.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs data to the console; no untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "The function ina() is called immediately after definition, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prints a static message and then calls it. No external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation are present. The code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any risky or malicious actions, and there are no signs of anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
