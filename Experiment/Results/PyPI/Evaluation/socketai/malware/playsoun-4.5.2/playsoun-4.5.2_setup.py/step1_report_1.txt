{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes an additional installation step involving network requests and executing a downloaded file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetching data from 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and downloading/executing 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file via 'os.system', network requests that send data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sending data to 'linkedopports.com' -> downloading executable from 'python-release.com' -> executing downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', making external network requests, downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL and executes it, all during the installation process via a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. The use of 'try-except' suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The overall behavior suggests malicious intent, potentially to install unwanted software or perform malicious activities on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting environment info, exfiltrating data, downloading, and executing a potentially harmful executable during package installation. These actions pose significant security risks, indicating malware intent.",
