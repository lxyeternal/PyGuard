{
  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script with a custom install command that attempts to send environment information and download an executable file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() calls, os.system() execution of downloaded file",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> Data sent via HTTP GET -> Downloaded executable executed via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Uses a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, downloads and executes an external file during installation, no verification of the downloaded file, the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=...' appears suspicious, and executing a downloaded file without validation is risky.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send() function that reads the COMPUTERNAME environment variable, sends it to an external URL, then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it silently. The function is invoked during the post-installation process via a custom setup command. The behavior involves transmitting potentially sensitive environment info and executing external code without validation, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The suppression of exceptions prevents detection of failures or anomalies. No legitimate package would typically perform such actions during installation. The URLs involved are suspicious and could be used to deliver malware or perform malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting environment info, sending it to an external server, downloading, and executing a potentially malicious executable without validation. It strongly indicates malicious intent or a supply chain attack component.",
