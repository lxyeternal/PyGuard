{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system environment data, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to external URLs, file download and execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over HTTP GET, executing downloaded payload with os.system.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sends data via requests.get -> downloads executable -> executes payload with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except to suppress errors, executing external code during setup without validation, hardcoded URLs, silent error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment data exfiltration, contacts suspicious domains, downloads and executes an external executable during installation, and suppresses errors to hide failures. These behaviors are characteristic of malware and pose high security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively exfiltrating data and executing external payloads during installation. The behavior aligns with known malicious supply chain activities. The scores of malware 0.9, security risk 0.9, and obfuscated 0 are justified.",
