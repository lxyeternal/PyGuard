  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and system-level actions to conceal its true intent. It exhibits behaviors consistent with malware, such as privilege escalation, system modification, and covert payload delivery. The high obfuscation and system interactions justify a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.85. It should be treated as a high-threat component requiring further analysis and caution."
