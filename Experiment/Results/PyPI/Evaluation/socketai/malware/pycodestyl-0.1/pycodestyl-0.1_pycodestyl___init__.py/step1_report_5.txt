  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or function within a larger project, potentially involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user input functions, or external files. No explicit sources identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system command executions that could handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables or user input, processes it with standard functions, and writes or transmits it through typical channels. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, unusual network connections, or credential theft are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The overall structure suggests a normal implementation with no hidden backdoors or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform legitimate functions without introducing vulnerabilities or malware.",
