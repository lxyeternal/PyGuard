  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script performing basic operations, likely for demonstration or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data, files, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment variable access if present, but none are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are observed, as the code does not handle external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed in its entirety; it does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or environment variable usage. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified. It appears to be a benign script with no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The script is simple and appears safe.",
