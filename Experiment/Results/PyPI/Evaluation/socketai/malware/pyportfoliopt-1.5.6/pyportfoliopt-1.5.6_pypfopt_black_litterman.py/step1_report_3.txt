{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions and a class for applying the Black-Litterman model to estimate asset returns and optimize portfolios, including utility functions for market-implied returns and risk aversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters such as market_cap, market_prices, covariance matrices, prior return estimates, views, and view confidences.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations to produce posterior returns, covariance, and portfolio weights. It does not write or transmit untrusted data outside the scope of its calculations.",
  "flows": "Inputs like market_caps and market_prices flow into functions calculating market-implied returns and risk aversion. These flows influence the posterior return and covariance computations within the BlackLittermanModel methods, which then produce portfolio weights.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are detected. Warning messages are standard and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for market-implied metrics and a well-structured implementation of the Black-Litterman model, including input validation, dimension checks, and standard mathematical procedures for Bayesian portfolio optimization. No external network calls, file operations, or hidden behaviors are present. The methods and functions perform legitimate financial calculations without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Black-Litterman model for portfolio optimization, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes data securely, relies on standard mathematical routines, and does not perform any harmful actions.",
