  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score can be set very low (~0.05), primarily due to the use of numpy.linalg.solve, which is standard and safe in this context."
