  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code performs standard financial modeling functions, with no network calls, file operations, or external data exfiltration.\n   - No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n   - The code relies solely on numpy, pandas, and standard Python practices.\n   - **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Malware score should be **0**.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Implementation:**\n   - The functions and class methods implement well-known formulas for market-implied returns, risk aversion, and Bayesian updating within the Black-Litterman framework.\n   - Input validation, warnings, and dimension checks are appropriately used.\n   - Linear algebra operations are performed using numpy.linalg.solve, which is standard and safe given valid inputs.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the model.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; set to **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation; set to **0**.\n   - **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious or suspicious activity, the overall security risk is negligible; set to **0** or very close to it.\n   - The reports assign a high confidence level (mostly 0.95 to 1), which is appropriate.\n   - The one report with a slightly higher security risk (0.1) appears to be a conservative estimate, but still no actual malicious activity is detected.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - The only concern could be the use of numpy.linalg.solve, but this is standard for linear algebra and not inherently risky.\n   - No external data transmission or system commands are present.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.01, but 0 is more appropriate given the evidence)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Black-Litterman model.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is present.\n- The security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
