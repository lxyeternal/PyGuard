{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for portfolio optimization using convex and non-convex methods, including utilities for handling weights, constraints, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "User input could come from function parameters such as 'input_weights', 'sector_mapper', 'sector_lower', 'sector_upper', and user-defined objectives and constraints. File outputs are written via 'save_weights_to_file'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur through 'save_weights_to_file' which writes weights to files in formats CSV, JSON, or TXT; no untrusted input is directly written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "User inputs (e.g., weights, constraints, objective functions) are processed internally. 'set_weights' transforms dict inputs into numpy arrays; 'save_weights_to_file' outputs weights to files. No flow of untrusted data to external systems or network occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code strictly handles portfolio optimization and file I/O. No malicious functions or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate portfolio optimization framework utilizing cvxpy and scipy. It includes functions for setting and cleaning weights, adding constraints/objectives, solving optimization problems, and exporting results. All external inputs are contained within parameters, and outputs are saved as files without suspicious content. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system harm is present. The code relies on standard libraries and practices consistent with financial modeling and optimization, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured portfolio optimization module with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected operations for its purpose and securely manages data flow within its scope.",
