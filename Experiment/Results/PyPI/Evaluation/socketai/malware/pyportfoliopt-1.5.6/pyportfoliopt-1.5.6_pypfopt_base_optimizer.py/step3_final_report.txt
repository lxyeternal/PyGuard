{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for portfolio optimization, including setting and cleaning weights, saving to files, and solving convex and non-convex optimization problems using cvxpy and scipy.",
  "sources": "Input data includes user-defined weights, constraints, objectives, and parameters; data is read from internal variables and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "File outputs in CSV, JSON, or TXT formats; no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and internal parameters through optimization routines to file outputs; no external untrusted data sources or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard scientific libraries (cvxpy, scipy, numpy, pandas) for portfolio optimization. File handling is constrained with extension checks, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The functions perform typical operations for such applications, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured portfolio optimization library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given the limited scope of file operations and standard library usage.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
