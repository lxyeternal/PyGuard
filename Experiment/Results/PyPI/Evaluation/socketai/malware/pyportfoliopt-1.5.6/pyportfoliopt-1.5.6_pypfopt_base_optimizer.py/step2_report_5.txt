  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard portfolio optimization framework, user inputs are function parameters.\n- **Sinks:** File outputs (csv, json, txt) — no network or external data leaks.\n- **Flows:** Data from inputs to optimization and file outputs; no external untrusted data flows outside file handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard libraries (cvxpy, scipy, numpy, pandas). No malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, just due to file outputs).\n\n**Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity. The low security risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard data inputs.\n- **Sinks:** File writing (csv, json, txt) — safe, constrained formats.\n- **Flows:** Data flows through optimization routines; no network or external exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard libraries, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard classes for portfolio optimization.\n- **Sinks:** File outputs, potential data leak if sensitive data is stored, but no malicious intent.\n- **Flows:** Data from inputs to optimization and outputs; no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses common scientific libraries; no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly higher but still low).\n\n**Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard optimization framework.\n- **Sinks:** File outputs, no network or external data leaks.\n- **Flows:** Data flows through user inputs and optimization routines.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard libraries, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard classes, typical data sources.\n- **Sinks:** File outputs only.\n- **Flows:** Data from user inputs to optimization routines; no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis:** Uses common libraries, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports show no signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The malware score should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding detected; should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to file output capabilities which are standard in such applications.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected in any report)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n**Risk:** Approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with the reports' assessments, considering the file output functionalities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code and reports collectively indicate a legitimate, secure portfolio optimization framework with no evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are reasonable and justified.",
