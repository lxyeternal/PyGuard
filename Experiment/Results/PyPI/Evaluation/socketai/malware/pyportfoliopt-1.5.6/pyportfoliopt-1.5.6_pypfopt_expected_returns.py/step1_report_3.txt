{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for estimating expected asset returns, including historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM-based models, primarily for use in portfolio optimization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from pandas DataFrames, specifically asset prices and optionally market prices. It processes data through mathematical transformations like percentage change, log, and exponential functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations and warnings but does not include network operations, file writes, or system commands. No untrusted data is directed to external systems or resources.",
  "flows": "Input prices or returns are transformed via percentage change or logarithm functions; these are used to compute mean returns, exponential weighted means, or CAPM estimates, returning numerical series or matrices. No external system or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors are observed. Functions are standard financial calculations with proper data validation. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are present. The warning messages are typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions for financial return estimation, including historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM models. It reads data via pandas DataFrames, applies mathematical transformations (percentage change, log, exponential), and performs statistical calculations like covariance and mean. Warnings are issued for data issues but are typical for data validation. The code lacks network activity, file operations, or system commands. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions are standard for financial modeling and include parameter validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of financial return estimation models with appropriate data handling and validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
