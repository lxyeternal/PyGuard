{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for estimating expected asset returns based on historical data and models, useful for portfolio optimization.",
  "sources": "Functions reading input data include returns_from_prices(), prices_from_returns(), and return_model(), which read prices or returns. Data is primarily obtained from pandas DataFrame inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are functions that process or output return estimates and perform calculations like mean_historical_return(), ema_historical_return(), and capm_return(). No direct data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (prices or returns) flows into functions like returns_from_prices() and return_model(), which process and produce return estimates. The outputs are used for portfolio optimization calculations but are not sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code mainly performs standard financial calculations with warnings for NaNs and infinities. No obfuscation, hidden network connections, or malicious data manipulation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data validation, return calculations, and financial modeling. It uses standard numpy and pandas operations, with no external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms. Warnings alert users to data issues but do not indicate malicious intent. The functions are well-structured and focus on legitimate financial analytics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate financial calculation library for estimating asset returns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. It adheres to normal practices in quantitative finance software.",
