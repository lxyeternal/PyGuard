{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for estimating expected asset returns using various models, including historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM, for use in portfolio optimization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from pandas DataFrames, specifically price data provided by the user. It processes this data into returns for analysis.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the functions perform calculations and warnings based on input data. There are no network connections, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input prices or returns are processed to produce return estimates; data flows from input DataFrames through calculations into returned Series or DataFrames. No external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code relies on standard financial calculations and pandas/numpy operations. Warning messages are generic and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical financial computations for return estimation, including mean, exponential weighted mean, and CAPM models. It uses pandas and numpy for data processing, with no external data transmission or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present. The warnings are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of financial models with proper data validation and warnings. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured financial modeling module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It processes input data securely and provides return estimates for portfolio analysis.",
