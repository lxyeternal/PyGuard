  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward financial modeling module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.1). The existing reports' assessments are accurate; the high risk scores in some reports should be lowered to reflect the low threat level."
