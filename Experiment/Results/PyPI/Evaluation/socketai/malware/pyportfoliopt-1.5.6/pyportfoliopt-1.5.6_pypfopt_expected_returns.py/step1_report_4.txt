{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for estimating expected asset returns using various models, including historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM-based methods, for use in portfolio optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads price data via pandas DataFrame inputs, particularly in functions like returns_from_prices, prices_from_returns, and return_model.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is sent over network, written to files, or used in dangerous system commands.",
  "flows": "Price data flows into return calculations and return estimations, which then produce numerical return series used for portfolio analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures detected. The code uses standard pandas and numpy functions with typical financial calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for calculating returns and return estimates based on provided price data. It performs input validation and warnings for NaNs or infinite values but does not process or transmit data insecurely. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or suspicious data handling routines are present. All operations are typical financial computations. The code’s behavior aligns with its purpose of return estimation and does not include malicious or backdoor functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate financial analysis library for estimating expected returns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard data handling and mathematical computations typical of financial modeling packages.",
