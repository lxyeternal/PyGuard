  "purpose": "Provides functions for estimating expected asset returns using historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM models, based on price data processed into returns.",
  "sources": "Price data input (pd.DataFrame), internal calculations on returns, market data for CAPM.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications; calculations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Price data -> returns calculation -> return estimations (mean, EMA, CAPM) -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of financial return models using pandas and numpy. It performs data validation with warnings, processes data into returns, and computes estimates without external communication or system modifications. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The warnings are benign and typical for data validation. The functions rely solely on in-memory data processing, with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward financial modeling module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.1). The existing reports' assessments are accurate; the high risk scores in some reports should be lowered to reflect the low threat level.",
