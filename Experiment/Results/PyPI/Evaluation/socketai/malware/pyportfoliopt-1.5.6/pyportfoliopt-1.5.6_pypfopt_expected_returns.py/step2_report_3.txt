  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, malware risk, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions for estimating expected returns via historical, exponential weighted, and CAPM models. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward, with standard pandas/numpy operations, warnings, and data validation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0 — no external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications.\n\n- **Assessment:** The logic and code are standard, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard return estimation functions, with no suspicious code or external data flows. The code performs normal calculations and data validation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0 — no external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard financial functions for return estimation, with typical data validation and no network or external data leaks. The code relies on pandas/numpy, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low; primarily just data validation warnings, no external system interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the slight security risk is negligible and related to data validation warnings only.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard functions for return calculations, no external data leaks, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external data transmission or system modifications.\n\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard financial modeling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: functions for return estimation, no suspicious code, no external data leaks, no obfuscation, and standard calculations.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external or system-level risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. All reports consistently find no malware, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily related to warnings about data issues, which are benign.\n\n- **Malware risk score:** Should be **0** across all reports, as no malicious code or behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0** for all reports.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the above, the overall risk is negligible, so a score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n- No changes needed; the code appears to be a standard, legitimate financial modeling library with no supply chain or malicious risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|---------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0          |\n\n**Final note:** The code is clean, transparent, and performs standard financial calculations without any malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and well within acceptable bounds for such a module.",
