{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to estimate expected asset returns for portfolio optimization, including historical, exponentially weighted, and CAPM-based models.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data primarily from pandas DataFrames, notably 'prices' and 'returns'. User inputs for method selection and parameters are processed internally.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; the functions return numerical estimates or warnings. No system calls, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input prices or returns are processed via helper functions (e.g., returns_from_prices). The return_model function routes data to specific models, which then compute estimates without external data transmission or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code, are present. Warnings for NaN or infinite values are standard checks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs statistical computations on pandas DataFrames for return estimation. It uses standard methods (mean, exponential moving average, CAPM) and warns about NaN or infinite values. No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated constructs are detected. All functions handle data cautiously and internally, with no external side effects or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured financial analysis module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected calculations for asset return estimation without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
