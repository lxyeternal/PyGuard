  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, potential vulnerabilities, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard financial modeling module for estimating asset returns.\n- It uses pandas and numpy for data processing.\n- No network, file, or system operations are present.\n- Warnings are used for data issues but are benign.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The functions perform typical calculations: mean, exponential weighted mean, CAPM.\n- Input validation and warnings are standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, standard financial code, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard calculations, no malicious behavior, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard functions, no suspicious activity, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is slightly above zero but justified given the code's financial calculations and data handling. No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard financial functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous assessments, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code performs no malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, matching the straightforward, transparent code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable; the slight risk could be due to the data validation warnings, but these are standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** 0 or 0.1 is appropriate; no higher scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, transparent financial calculation module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report could be maintained for conservative caution but isn't necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's actual content. No modifications are needed.",
