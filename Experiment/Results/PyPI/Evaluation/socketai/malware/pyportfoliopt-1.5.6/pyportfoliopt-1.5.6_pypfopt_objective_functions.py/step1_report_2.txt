  "purpose": "Provide various optimization objective functions for portfolio management, including variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, tracking error, and transaction costs.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as weights, expected returns, covariance matrices, historic returns, and previous weights.",
  "sinks": "Outputs objective function values or cvxpy expressions; no evident data leaks or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into objective functions which return either numerical values or cvxpy expressions used in optimization modeling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Uses standard mathematical formulations and cvxpy functions without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides multiple well-defined portfolio optimization objectives using numpy and cvxpy. Functions conditionally return scalar values or cvxpy expressions depending on input types, facilitating both internal optimization and external evaluation. No external network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All operations are mathematically standard for portfolio management and do not indicate malicious intent. The code relies on common libraries and straightforward implementations without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate set of objective functions for portfolio optimization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly performs mathematical calculations related to portfolio metrics. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, data leaks, or external communication mechanisms.",
