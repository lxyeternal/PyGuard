{
  "purpose": "Provides various optimization objective functions for portfolio management, including variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, tracking error, and transaction costs, used internally and externally for optimization.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy and cvxpy; functions receive inputs such as weights, covariance matrices, expected returns, previous weights, and historic data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to or transmit data; it calculates mathematical expressions and values. No data leaks or network activity are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs (weights, matrices, returns) are processed within functions to compute objective expressions or scalar values, returning them via _objective_value. No external data flows outside this process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Functions perform standard financial calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple objective functions for portfolio optimization, handling both numpy arrays and cvxpy variables, with a helper to switch between scalar and expression outputs. No input/output beyond calculations; no network, file, or environment variable access. Functions use standard mathematical operations without any hidden or malicious behavior. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code adheres to typical financial modeling practices, and all functions appear legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of portfolio optimization objective functions with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs mathematical computations using well-known libraries for legitimate optimization purposes. No security threats or malware detected.",
