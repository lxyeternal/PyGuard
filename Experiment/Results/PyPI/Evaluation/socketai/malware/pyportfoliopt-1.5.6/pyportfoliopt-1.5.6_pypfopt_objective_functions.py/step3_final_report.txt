{
  "purpose": "This module provides various portfolio optimization objective functions, including variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, tracking error, and transaction costs, designed for internal optimization routines and external objective evaluations.",
  "sources": "Functions accept weights as np.ndarray or cp.Variable; data inputs include expected_returns, cov_matrix, historic_returns, benchmark_weights, previous weights, and parameters like risk_free_rate, gamma, k, risk_aversion.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily computes mathematical expressions; no external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (weights, data parameters) flow into objective functions which produce either scalar values or cvxpy expressions; these are used internally for optimization or externally for evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and mathematically standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple portfolio objectives, handling both numpy arrays and cvxpy variables, with a helper function to switch between scalar and expression outputs. All functions perform standard financial calculations without external system interactions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, legitimate, and aligns with typical portfolio optimization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of portfolio objective functions with no malicious intent or security issues. It handles data securely within its scope and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
