  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code defines multiple portfolio objective functions: variance, return, Sharpe ratio, L2 regularization, quadratic utility, transaction costs, and tracking errors.\n- It handles both numpy arrays and cvxpy variables, with a helper function `_objective_value` to switch between scalar and expression outputs.\n- No network, file, or external system interactions are present.\n- The functions perform standard mathematical calculations for portfolio optimization.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The purpose is clearly related to financial optimization, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on Code Behavior:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code appears correct, with no logical errors or suspicious behavior. It performs standard calculations.\n\n- **Malware or malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code is purely mathematical, with no network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  None detected. It uses common libraries (`numpy`, `cvxpy`) for legitimate purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard, no issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard functions, no malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Scores seem appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Same as above, consistent with a legitimate module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Similar findings, functions are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Same consistent pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The functions are typical for portfolio optimization and do not pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a straightforward implementation of financial optimization objectives with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is legitimate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
