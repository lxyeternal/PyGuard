  "purpose": "Provide various portfolio optimization objective functions for internal and external use, including variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, tracking error, and transaction costs.",
  "sources": "Reads input data such as weights, expected returns, covariance matrices, previous weights, historic returns, and benchmark weights. Uses numpy for data handling and cvxpy for expression formulation.",
  "sinks": "Returns either numerical values or cvxpy expressions which may be used in optimization. No direct data output or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (weights, returns, matrices) is processed within functions to produce either scalar objective values or cvxpy expressions, depending on input types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. No apparent data leakage or privacy violations. Functions primarily perform mathematical calculations relevant to portfolio optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple objective functions for portfolio optimization, handling both numpy arrays and cvxpy variables to support flexible usage. The helper function '_objective_value' distinguishes between numeric and cvxpy expression outputs to accommodate different stages of optimization. The main functions perform standard financial computations: variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, quadratic utility, transaction costs, and tracking errors. These functions incorporate parameterization for negatives to align maximization/minimization objectives. No external data streams, network communication, or system modifications are present. The code appears purely mathematical and analytical, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains legitimate and standard portfolio optimization objectives with no signs of malicious code, sabotage, or security threats. The code's purpose is clear, and its operations are typical for financial optimization routines. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
