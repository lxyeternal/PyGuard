{
  "purpose": "The code provides various objective functions for portfolio optimization, including calculations for variance, return, Sharpe ratio, regularization, utility, transaction costs, and tracking error, primarily to be used within an optimization framework.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as 'w', 'expected_returns', 'cov_matrix', 'w_prev', 'benchmark_weights', 'historic_returns', and 'benchmark_returns'.",
  "sinks": "Uses inputs directly in calculations; no explicit data leaks or untrusted data handling identified. The functions return either scalar values or cvxpy expressions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into calculations for objectives, which are then returned as scalar or cvxpy expression outputs. No external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform standard mathematical operations for portfolio optimization. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard portfolio optimization objectives with clear, well-documented functions. It differentiates between numeric and cvxpy variable inputs, returning appropriate expressions or scalar values. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be a legitimate module for financial optimization tasks, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate and standard implementation of portfolio objective functions for optimization purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for financial calculations without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
