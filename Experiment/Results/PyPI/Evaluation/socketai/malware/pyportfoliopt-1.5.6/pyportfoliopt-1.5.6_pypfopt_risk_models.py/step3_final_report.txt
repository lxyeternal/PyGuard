{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for estimating and fixing covariance matrices, including various shrinkage methods and conversions between covariance and correlation matrices.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrame (prices or returns), and internal calculations on these data; no external data sources or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Outputs covariance or correlation matrices; no data exfiltration, network communication, or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrame -> returns calculation or covariance estimation -> fixing non-PSD matrices -> conversion functions; no external data flows or untrusted inputs lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Warnings about deprecated methods are standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical operations for covariance estimation, including fixing non-positive semidefinite matrices and various shrinkage techniques. It uses common scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn) and handles data securely. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code structure is clear, with proper input validation and warnings. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of covariance estimation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
