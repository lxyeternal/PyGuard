  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `OptimizationError` and `InstantiationError`.\n   - `OptimizationError` provides a default message indicating potential issues with optimization routines, especially related to cvxpy solver flags.\n   - `InstantiationError` is a placeholder exception for errors during object instantiation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, external calls, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Report Summaries:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - They note the absence of malicious intent, obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling within a larger optimization framework.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and all indicate zero malware, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n3. **Logical and Security Assessment:**\n   - The code contains no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The default message in `OptimizationError` is static and appropriate.\n   - No external dependencies or network interactions are present.\n   - The exception classes are typical and serve a clear purpose.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious code detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified given the benign nature and lack of security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.\n\n6. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions.\n   - No modifications are necessary; the current scores and assessments are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis module is a harmless, well-structured part of a larger codebase, with no security concerns.",
