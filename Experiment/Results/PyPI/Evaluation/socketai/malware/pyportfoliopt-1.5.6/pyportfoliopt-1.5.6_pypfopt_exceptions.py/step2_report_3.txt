  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of two custom exception classes, `OptimizationError` and `InstantiationError`. Both are straightforward, inherit from Python's `Exception`, and contain no suspicious or malicious logic. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for exception handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no anomalies, no malicious intent, and no security risks. They also appropriately note the absence of obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The `risk` score is also 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all evidence points to harmless, standard exception class definitions, there is no justification for elevating the risk scores. The code does not perform any malicious actions or pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a straightforward, well-structured definition of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. It is a standard component of a larger library, and the reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
