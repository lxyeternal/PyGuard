{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in optimization routines and object instantiation within a larger package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for OptimizationError and InstantiationError; constructor method for OptimizationError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception messages are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The default message in OptimizationError is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with one class having a constructor that sets a default message. There are no data inputs, no network or file interactions, and no dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is present. The purpose appears to be to facilitate clearer error handling within a larger package. The code is clean, simple, and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a standard, safe component of a larger software project.",
