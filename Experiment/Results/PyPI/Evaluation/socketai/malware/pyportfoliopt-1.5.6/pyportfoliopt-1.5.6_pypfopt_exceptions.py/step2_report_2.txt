  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `OptimizationError` and `InstantiationError`.\n   - `OptimizationError` provides a default message indicating optimization failure, typically related to cvxpy solver flags.\n   - `InstantiationError` is a placeholder for errors during object instantiation.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation**:\n   - The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - No external dependencies or data flows that could introduce security risks.\n   - The default message in `OptimizationError` is static and non-sensitive.\n   - The `InstantiationError` class is a simple placeholder with no additional logic.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and unobfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely exception class definitions.\n   - The default message in `OptimizationError` is static and appropriate; no concerns about dynamic content or injection.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent with the code content.\n   - No report suggests any malicious or suspicious behavior, aligning with a score of zero for malware and obfuscation.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, the module is a benign, standard exception handling component.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score**: Keep at 0.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports: all scores should remain at zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exceptions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
