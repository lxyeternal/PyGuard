  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `OptimizationError` and `InstantiationError`.\n   - `OptimizationError` includes a constructor that sets a default message.\n   - Both classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no external data reads, network interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, typical for exception handling modules.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Review**:\n   - The code is standard, well-structured, and free of anomalies.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The default message in `OptimizationError` is static and informative.\n   - The `InstantiationError` class is a placeholder, which is common for custom exceptions.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n   - Security risk is also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The purpose is purely to define exception classes, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating strong agreement.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n   - The default message is static and does not rely on external input, reducing risk.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign exception handling module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code review.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.",
