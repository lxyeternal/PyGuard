  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling in an optimization context.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flows leading to external systems or sensitive data leakage.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with only class definitions and docstrings; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, OptimizationError and InstantiationError, with clear, non-malicious purposes. OptimizationError provides a default message related to optimization failures, while InstantiationError is a placeholder for instantiation errors. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data leakage, or backdoors. The code structure and content are standard for exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains harmless class definitions for custom exceptions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger optimization library or framework.",
