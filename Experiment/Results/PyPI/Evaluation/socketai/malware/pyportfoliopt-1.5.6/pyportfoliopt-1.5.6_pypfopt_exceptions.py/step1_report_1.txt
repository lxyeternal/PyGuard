{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in optimization routines and object instantiation errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception constructors; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. The OptimizationError class provides a default message for failed optimization routines, specifically related to cvxpy solver flags. The InstantiationError class is a placeholder for instantiation-related errors with no additional logic. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior; the code is standard and focused on exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This module simply defines custom exceptions for a larger optimization framework. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe for use.",
