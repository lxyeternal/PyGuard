  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling optimization and instantiation errors within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are instantiated and raised within other code contexts.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. 'OptimizationError' provides a static default message indicating optimization failure, likely related to solver issues. 'InstantiationError' is a placeholder for errors during object creation. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in an optimization context, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. It poses no threat and is appropriate for inclusion in a larger codebase. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified.",
