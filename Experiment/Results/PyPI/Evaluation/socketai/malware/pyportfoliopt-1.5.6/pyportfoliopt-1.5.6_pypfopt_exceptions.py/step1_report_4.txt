{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in optimization routines and object instantiation errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, with one class including a default message in its constructor. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. It appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling code for a library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of a larger library for handling specific error scenarios.",
