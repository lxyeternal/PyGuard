{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in an optimization framework or library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the classes are simple exception definitions without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes: OptimizationError and InstantiationError. OptimizationError provides a default message indicating a failure in an optimization routine, possibly related to cvxpy. InstantiationError is a placeholder for errors during object instantiation. Both classes inherit from Exception without any suspicious logic or external calls. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a Python module defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger optimization library.",
