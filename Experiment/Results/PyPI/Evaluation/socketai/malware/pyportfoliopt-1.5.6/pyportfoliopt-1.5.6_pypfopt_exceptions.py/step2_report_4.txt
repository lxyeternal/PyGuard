  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `OptimizationError` and `InstantiationError`.\n   - `OptimizationError` provides a default message indicating an optimization failure, likely related to cvxpy solver flags.\n   - `InstantiationError` is a placeholder for errors during object instantiation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or complex logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Analyses:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is standard, benign, and serves as part of a larger optimization framework.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no external data flows, no external interactions, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - The reports assign a security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are uniform and accurate; no anomalies, errors, or logical flaws are present.\n   - The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is correct; no malicious intent or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe component for exception handling within an optimization library.\n   - No further action or change in scoring is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.",
