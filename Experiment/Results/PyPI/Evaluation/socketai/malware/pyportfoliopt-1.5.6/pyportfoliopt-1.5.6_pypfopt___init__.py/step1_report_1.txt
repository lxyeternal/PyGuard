{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a financial modeling library, exposing various functions and classes related to portfolio optimization, risk modeling, and allocation strategies.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read within this code; it primarily imports and exports functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only assigns module attributes and imports modules.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as this code does not handle input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard module export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules related to financial algorithms and exposes specific functions and classes via __all__. It also sets a version string. There are no input handling, network operations, or data processing that could lead to security issues. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign module export file for a Python financial library. It does not contain any malicious code, security risks, or anomalies.",
