  "purpose": "This code is primarily a module that imports various functions and classes from other modules related to portfolio optimization and risk modeling, and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local modules: black_litterman, cla, discrete_allocation, efficient_frontier, hierarchical_portfolio, risk_models.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a module version and export list. It does not process input data, execute network operations, or perform any computations that could be malicious. All imported modules appear related to financial modeling and portfolio optimization, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward import and export module for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks present in this code fragment.",
