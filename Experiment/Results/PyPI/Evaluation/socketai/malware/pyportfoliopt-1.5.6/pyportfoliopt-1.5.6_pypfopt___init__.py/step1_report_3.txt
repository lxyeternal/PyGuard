{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py module to organize and export functions and classes from various components of a Python package related to portfolio optimization and risk modeling.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only internal imports and version declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only imports and module attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated features, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward, only re-exporting package components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for package exports. It does not perform any runtime data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are detected; it appears to be a standard package initialization file intended for organized exposure of functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes exports for the package and contains no potentially harmful or suspicious code.",
