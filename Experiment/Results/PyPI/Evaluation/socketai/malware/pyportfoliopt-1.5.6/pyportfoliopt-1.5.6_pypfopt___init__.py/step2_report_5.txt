  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content and structure**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward module initialization or export file.\n   - It only imports internal modules related to financial modeling and exposes specific functions/classes via `__all__`.\n   - No external input, network operations, or data processing are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Security implications**:\n   - Since the code only manages imports and exports, with no runtime data handling, network activity, or external dependencies beyond internal modules, the risk of malicious behavior is extremely low.\n   - The absence of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external communication reduces the attack surface.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), consistent with the clear and straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Overall assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign module export file.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final estimation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a typical package initialization file that solely manages module exports. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation**: No adjustments needed.",
