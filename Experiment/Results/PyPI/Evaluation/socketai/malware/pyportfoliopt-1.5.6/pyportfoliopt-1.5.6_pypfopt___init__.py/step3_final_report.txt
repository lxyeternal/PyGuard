{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator, importing various functions and classes related to financial modeling and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports from the same package; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing internal functions/classes and defining __all__ and __version__. It contains no runtime data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution. Static analysis shows no malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate a benign purpose, typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
