{
  "purpose": "This code exports various functions and classes related to financial modeling and portfolio optimization, serving as an API interface for a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules (.black_litterman, .cla, .discrete_allocation, .efficient_frontier, .hierarchical_portfolio, .risk_models). No external data input handling is present here.",
  "sinks": "The code exports selected functions/classes via __all__, but does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this file only manages imports and exports, with no data flow or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward, focused on module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, then declares __version__ and __all__ to control what is exposed publicly. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or module aggregator. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward package interface file, exporting components for external use without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and well-structured, with no security concerns.",
