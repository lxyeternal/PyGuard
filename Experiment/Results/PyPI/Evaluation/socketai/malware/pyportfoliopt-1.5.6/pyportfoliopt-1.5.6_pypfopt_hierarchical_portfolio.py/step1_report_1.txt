  "purpose": "Implement hierarchical risk parity portfolio optimization using hierarchical clustering methods.",
  "sources": "Inputs: returns DataFrame, cov_matrix DataFrame; External libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy.cluster.hierarchy, scipy.spatial.distance",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if external data sources are used, but none are evident; No direct untrusted data sinks detected",
  "flows": "Input returns or covariance data -> compute correlation/distance -> hierarchical clustering -> compute cluster variances -> allocate weights -> output weights and performance metrics",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; code appears consistent with a standard implementation of hierarchical risk parity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for hierarchical risk parity portfolio optimization. It relies on established libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) and standard calculations for covariance, correlation, and hierarchical clustering. No suspicious network, file, or environment variable access is present. The only external interaction involves reading data and performing calculations; no data exfiltration or malicious activity is evident. Methods like 'optimize' and 'portfolio_performance' follow typical financial computations. No obfuscated or misleading code is detected. The code structure is clear, and all operations serve the stated purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of hierarchical risk parity portfolio optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of external libraries is appropriate and standard for such financial computations. Overall, the package appears safe and purpose-driven.",
