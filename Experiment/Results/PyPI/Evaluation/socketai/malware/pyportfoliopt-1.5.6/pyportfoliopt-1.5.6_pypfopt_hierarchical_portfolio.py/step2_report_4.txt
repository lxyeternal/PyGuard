  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Clear, standard implementation of HRP with no suspicious code, external data leaks, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues detected. The high confidence (1) aligns with the findings.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard, legitimate implementation with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still very high, matching the thorough analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard code with no suspicious behaviors, external data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the analysis. High confidence (0.95).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports—standard, secure, no malicious activity. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to conservative estimation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The low securityRisk score is reasonable given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard, purpose-driven, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the analyses confirm no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, justified by the straightforward, standard implementation and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical implementation of hierarchical risk parity portfolio optimization.\n- No external network, file, or environment interactions suggest malicious intent.\n- Use of standard scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) aligns with legitimate financial analysis.\n- No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is secure, well-structured, and purpose-driven, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
