  "purpose": "Implementation of hierarchical risk parity (HRP) portfolio optimization using hierarchical clustering methods to allocate assets efficiently.",
  "sources": "Input data includes asset returns (pd.DataFrame) or covariance matrix (pd.DataFrame), which are read from provided data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, send data over networks, or perform any data exfiltration; it only computes internal portfolio weights and performance metrics.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (returns or covariance), through correlation and distance calculations, hierarchical clustering, and recursive variance-based weight allocations, culminating in setting internal weights and performance outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The implementation relies solely on standard scientific libraries and deterministic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard hierarchical clustering and risk parity calculations for portfolio optimization. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) without external network activity or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are detected. The implementation is transparent, purpose-driven, and aligns with accepted financial modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of hierarchical risk parity portfolio optimization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk and malware scores are justified as zero, and the overall assessment indicates a safe and purpose-specific module.",
