  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed conditionally during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and potential payloads justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the code should be treated as malicious and handled with caution."
