      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with silent error handling. While the setup code itself appears benign, the embedded behavior warrants treating this package as potentially malicious. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified based on these indicators."
