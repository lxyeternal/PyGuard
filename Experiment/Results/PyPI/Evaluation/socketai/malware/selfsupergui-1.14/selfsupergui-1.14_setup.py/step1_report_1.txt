{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package named 'selfsupergui' with some package dependencies and metadata. It also contains obfuscated code that may attempt to execute hidden commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data via 'os.path.exists', and potentially executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via 'subprocess.Popen'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the PowerShell command is a sink, which could be used to run malicious code or connect to malicious domains.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file ('tahg') and, if not found, executes a hidden PowerShell command. The flow is: check file existence -> run obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command that is encoded and run silently. The URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and the encoded command suggest malicious intent. The use of 'try-except' blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package setup. It then attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command if the 'tahg' file does not exist. The command is obfuscated and encoded, which is suspicious. The URL in the comment and the encoded command suggest possible malicious activity, such as connecting to or exfiltrating data to a remote server. The use of broad exception handling further conceals errors or suspicious activity. The setup function itself appears legitimate for package configuration, but the pre-setup code is potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution that may be malicious, possibly used for exfiltration or establishing covert communication. The setup code is legitimate, but the pre-setup actions are suspicious and potentially malicious. Overall, the package exhibits a high likelihood of malicious intent due to obfuscated code and hidden network activity.",
