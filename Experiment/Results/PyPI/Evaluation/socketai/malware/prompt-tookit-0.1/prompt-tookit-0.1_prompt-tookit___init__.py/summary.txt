  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurately scored; however, Report 3's malware score should be increased from 0.3 to approximately 0.5 to better represent the security risks posed by hardcoded secrets and unsafe subprocess usage. The overall threat level remains moderate, with the highest concern stemming from suspicious behaviors in Reports 2 and 3."
