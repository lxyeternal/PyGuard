{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyultra' package, with embedded code potentially executing remote commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of 'tahg' directory and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the PowerShell command, which could potentially run arbitrary code or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' directory exists -> If not, run PowerShell encoded command in background.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded and executed silently without clear purpose. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and hidden window indicates attempt to conceal activity. No visible benign reason for executing such a command during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If this directory does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command. The command appears to be base64-encoded, likely executing malicious or obfuscated code. The setup function for 'pyultra' is then called with package details. All execution blocks are wrapped in try-except clauses that suppress errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The embedded PowerShell command's purpose is suspicious, especially given the use of encoded commands and hidden window parameters, indicating possible malicious intent or an attempt to execute remote code silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command execution with obfuscated encoding, likely designed to run malicious or unauthorized code during package setup. The presence of suppressed errors and concealed execution strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. Overall, the code exhibits high suspicion for malicious behavior.",
