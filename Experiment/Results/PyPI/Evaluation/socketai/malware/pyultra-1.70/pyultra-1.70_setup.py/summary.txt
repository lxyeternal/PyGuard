  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup. The behavior aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores around 0.8–0.9 and a high security risk (~0.85). Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
