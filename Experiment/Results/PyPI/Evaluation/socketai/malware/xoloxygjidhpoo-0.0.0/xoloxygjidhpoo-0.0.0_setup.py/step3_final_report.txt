{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'xoloxygjidhpoo' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, list of dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'xoloxygjidhpoo', dependencies like 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook' that could be misused if combined with malicious code, but no such code is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscated logic. The package name appears nonsensical, which could be an obfuscation tactic or an attempt to disguise malicious intent, but in the context of this static setup script, it does not indicate malicious activity. Dependencies included are common but could be misused if malicious code were added elsewhere; however, their mere presence in this configuration is not suspicious. No code logic, network activity, or data leaks are present. The author fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the script is benign, with a low security risk primarily due to the suspicious package name and dependencies that could be misused outside this context.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no active malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the unusual package name and the inclusion of dependencies that could be misused if malicious code is added later. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concern over the package name and dependencies but no active threat.",
