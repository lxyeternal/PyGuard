  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no active malicious code or obfuscation. The only concern is the unusual package name and the inclusion of dependencies that could be misused if malicious code is added later. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concern over the package name and dependencies but no active threat."
