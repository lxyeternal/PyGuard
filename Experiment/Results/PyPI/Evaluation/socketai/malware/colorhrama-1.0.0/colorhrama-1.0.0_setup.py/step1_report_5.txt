{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom install behavior that includes decryption and execution of code using Fernet.",
  "sources": "Fernet decryption key and encrypted data within the 'run' method, environment detection via os.name, import statements for requests and fernet within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing and executing code from Fernet decryption, network-related imports (requests), environment checks.",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers Fernet decryption, which decrypts code that is then executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Decryption of code at install time using a hardcoded Fernet key, immediate execution of decrypted code with exec(), dynamic import of potentially malicious modules within install method, obfuscated description strings, lack of validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install class 'GruppeInstall'. During installation on Windows systems ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded Fernet key, executing the decrypted code via exec(). The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, suggesting potential malicious intent. The use of exec() on decrypted code poses significant security risks, as malicious payloads can be embedded and executed without any validation. The decryption and execution only occur during installation on Windows, indicating targeted behavior. Overall, these patterns—hardcoded keys, dynamic code execution, and decryption—are common indicators of malicious or sabotage activity in supply chain contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to hardcoded decryption and execution of decrypted payload during package installation, representing a serious security risk. It appears designed to execute arbitrary code silently, possibly for malicious purposes.",
