      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to decrypting and executing encrypted payloads during installation, with hardcoded cryptographic material and environment-specific execution. The reports correctly identify these issues, and the scores are appropriate. This package should be flagged as malicious or unsafe for use."
