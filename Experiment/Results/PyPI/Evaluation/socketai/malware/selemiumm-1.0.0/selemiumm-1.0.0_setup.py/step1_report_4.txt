{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a remote code decryption and execution under certain conditions.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements, Fernet decryption, exec() function with decrypted code",
  "sinks": "exec() with decrypted code execution, requests and os modules imported dynamically",
  "flows": "os.name condition triggers import of requests and Fernet, then executes code decrypted with Fernet, which may include arbitrary commands",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet decryption with hardcoded key, dynamic execution of decrypted code, conditional remote code execution based on OS, obfuscated and nonsensical descriptions, presence of suspicious encrypted payload",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup process for a package named 'selemiumm'. It contains obfuscated description fields and a custom install class that, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior indicates dynamic code execution based on remote- or hardcoded data, which is a common malicious pattern. The code is deliberately obfuscated with nonsensical variable names and encrypted strings, suggesting an attempt to hide malicious intent. The decrypted code could perform any arbitrary operation, including malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The setup_requires including 'fernet' and 'requests' could be used for network communication, adding to suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, conditional remote code execution with hardcoded decryption keys, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package performs potentially harmful actions during installation, which should be considered dangerous.",
