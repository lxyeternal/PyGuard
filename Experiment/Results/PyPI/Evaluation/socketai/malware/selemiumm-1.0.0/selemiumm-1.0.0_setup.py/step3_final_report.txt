{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts and executes a payload during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload string, Fernet decryption key, environment variable check, import of requests and cryptography modules.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key, then executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, obfuscated class and description strings, hardcoded cryptographic key, dynamic execution of code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional decryption and execution of arbitrary code during installation, which is a classic malicious pattern. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads are used to conceal malicious intent. The use of exec() with decrypted code is highly suspicious and indicates potential backdoor or malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code designed to execute arbitrary, decrypted code during installation, representing a high security threat and supply chain attack vector.",
