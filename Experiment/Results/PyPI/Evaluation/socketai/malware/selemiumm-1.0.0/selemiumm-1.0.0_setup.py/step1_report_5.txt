{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'selemiumm' with a custom install command that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external modules (requests, fernet), embedded encrypted data for decryption, and possibly external network requests during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), import of requests, and Fernet usage for decryption, which could be exploited to run malicious code or communicate with malicious servers.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(), enabling malicious remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed via exec(), use of hardcoded encryption key, obfuscated variable and class names, and a devious setup that runs code during package installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', decrypts an embedded encrypted string with a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code. The presence of encrypted code, dynamic execution via exec(), and network-related modules suggest potential malicious intent, such as executing remote code or establishing backdoors. The obfuscation in class and variable names, combined with the code running during installation, indicates malicious obfuscation. The setup dependencies include 'fernet' and 'requests', which are commonly used for network communication and cryptography, but in this context, they may facilitate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behaviors such as decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, use of hardcoded keys, and obfuscated naming. These elements strongly indicate malicious intent or backdoor behavior embedded within the package. The script is designed to run arbitrary code during installation, which is a significant security risk.",
