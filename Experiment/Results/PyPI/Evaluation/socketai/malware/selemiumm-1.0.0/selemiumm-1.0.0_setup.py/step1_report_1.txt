{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package called 'selemiumm' with custom installation behavior that includes executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code using exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, remote code execution, or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "If os.name is 'nt', requests and Fernet are imported, then the code decrypts a string and executes it via exec(), which can run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted payloads with Fernet, followed by executing decrypted content, is suspicious. The obfuscated package name, description, and long description contain random text, indicating obfuscation or hiding malicious intent. The code dynamically decrypts and executes code during install, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process by adding a custom install command class that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload using Fernet with a hardcoded key, and executes it with exec(). This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code includes obfuscated strings and encrypted payloads, which are typical signs of malicious obfuscation or backdoor functionality. The code's overall structure suggests it is designed to hide malicious behavior during the package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, executing decrypted code during installation based on conditions, indicating a high risk of supply chain attack. The code is obfuscated and employs techniques typical of malicious packages. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered dangerous.",
