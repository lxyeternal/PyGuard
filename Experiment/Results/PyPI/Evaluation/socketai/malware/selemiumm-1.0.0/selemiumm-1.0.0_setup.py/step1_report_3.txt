{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'selemiumm' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code if run on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('requests', 'fernet') during installation, and decrypts/executing embedded encrypted code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can be malicious if the encrypted payload contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a payload with Fernet, and executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed at install time, dynamic code execution via exec, obfuscated variable names, and encrypted data suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package called 'selemiumm'. A custom install class runs during installation, and if the OS is Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an embedded payload with Fernet and executes it. The encrypted payload and obfuscated class name imply potential malicious activity, possibly executing hidden or harmful code at install time. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup tasks besides this malicious-looking behavior. The presence of encrypted code and dynamic execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this pattern is common in malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to contain malicious behavior, executing decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and obfuscated class name reinforce suspicion of malicious intent. The package may act as a trojan, executing hidden code upon installation, which could be harmful.",
