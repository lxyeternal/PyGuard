  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs custom installation code.",
  "sources": "Imports os, requests, fernet; decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string; reads environment variables and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code; potentially malicious code execution. No other explicit sinks observed.",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers execution of decrypted code via exec(), which is derived from Fernet decryption, potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted string executed via exec(); no meaningful comments or documentation; use of Fernet decryption key embedded in code; encrypted payload unverified; suspiciously obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that installs a package named 'selemiumm'. It defines a custom install command class that, upon execution, checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography' and decrypts an embedded encrypted string with a hardcoded key. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). The presence of encrypted payload and dynamic execution raises significant concerns about malicious intent, such as executing hidden backdoors or malicious code during installation. No other suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration or network connections outside of dependencies, are evident. The code's obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains encrypted payload executed at install time, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It indicates possible backdoor or malicious activity embedded in the setup process, warranting caution before use.",
