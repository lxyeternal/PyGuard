  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Use of 'exec()' (potentially untrusted input), environment variables, network connections, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution functions ('exec()'), network communication points, data leaks via environment variables or output.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) reaching 'exec()' or network functions, potential data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' without context of trusted input, potential dynamic code execution, no obfuscation detected, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution via 'exec()', which is inherently risky, especially if input is untrusted. No evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or obfuscation. The risk primarily stems from 'exec()' usage, which could be exploited if misused. Other patterns appear benign, with standard data processing and network interactions. The confidence in malicious activity is low; the main concern is the potential for misuse of dynamic execution functions. Scores reflect this: malware at 0.2-0.4 depending on context, security risk around 0.3-0.4, and obfuscation at 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows risky practices due to 'exec()' but lacks concrete malicious payloads or activity. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to dynamic code execution potential. Scores are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher malware score (0.4) if 'exec()' is confirmed to handle untrusted input. No obfuscation detected. Continuous monitoring recommended.",
