{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, likely related to a larger project.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if any are present.",
  "sinks": "Data output or effects occur at print statements, file writes, or network transmissions if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., 'input_data', environment variables) to processing functions and then to output sinks (e.g., print, file).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code structure appears typical, with no unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks, including reading inputs, processing data, and outputting results. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling of data is evident. Use of third-party libraries appears benign. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The code lacks any hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments. Overall, it looks like typical application code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious component of a larger application.",
