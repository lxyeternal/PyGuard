  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "conclusion": "The code shows risky practices due to 'exec()' but lacks concrete malicious payloads or activity. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to dynamic code execution potential. Scores are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher malware score (0.4) if 'exec()' is confirmed to handle untrusted input. No obfuscation detected. Continuous monitoring recommended."
