{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of a Python library called 'pyfontslib'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables such as VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "targets": "No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or propagate any input data; it merely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It defines package metadata and dependencies, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious logic. All variables are static strings; there are no input streams, external data fetches, or dynamic code. The use of setuptools and find_packages() is typical for Python packaging. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior concerns.",
