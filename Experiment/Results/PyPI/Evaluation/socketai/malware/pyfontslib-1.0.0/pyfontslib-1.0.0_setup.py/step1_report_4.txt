  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, assignment of version and description variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code",
  "flows": "The setup() function is called with static parameters; no data flows from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python library. It defines package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and dependencies. No external input, untrusted data, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data leaks. It appears to be a typical, benign setup script.",
