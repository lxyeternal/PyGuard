  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static values. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. The script is a typical Python package setup script without signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration for distributing a Python library.",
