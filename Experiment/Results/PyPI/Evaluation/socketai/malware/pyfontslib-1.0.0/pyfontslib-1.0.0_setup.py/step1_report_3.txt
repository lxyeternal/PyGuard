  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pyfontslib' Python library.",
  "sources": "Readings include hardcoded metadata variables (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network, file, or environment variable access is observed.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining metadata variables to passing them into the setup() function; no untrusted data sources or data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python library, with static metadata variables and a call to setuptools.setup(). No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code adheres to common packaging practices without any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
