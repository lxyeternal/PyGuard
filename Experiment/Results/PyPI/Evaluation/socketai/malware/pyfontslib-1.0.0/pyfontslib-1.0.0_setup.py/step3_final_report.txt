  "purpose": "A standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'pyfontslib'.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version, description, long description; find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static data used directly in setup() without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static metadata and package discovery. No dynamic code, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and risk scores of 0. Confidence levels are high, and no inconsistencies are observed. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign Python packaging script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
