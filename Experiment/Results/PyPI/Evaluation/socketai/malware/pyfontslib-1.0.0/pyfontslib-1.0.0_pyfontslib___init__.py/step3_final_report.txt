{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly invasive malware designed for comprehensive data theft, including browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, system details, Discord tokens, and cryptocurrency addresses. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, employs process termination, persistence mechanisms, anti-debugging, and obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, clipboard content, browser data files (SQLite databases), registry entries, process lists, network requests, local files (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), system info commands, and user input.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs (webhook and transfer.sh), file uploads (ZIP archives), local file writes (logs, stolen data), process termination commands, and self-deletion routines.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources such as browser databases, environment variables, clipboard, and system commands, then decrypted or processed, and finally exfiltrated via network requests or stored in local files for upload. The code decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts tokens, system info, and addresses, then sends this data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive static data lists (e.g., process names, URLs, addresses), obfuscation and complex control flow, hardcoded webhooks and URLs, aggressive process termination routines, anti-debugging checks, persistence via startup folder, disabling security tools, and dynamic code execution routines.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple layers of data collection routines targeting browsers, system info, and tokens, decrypts sensitive data using stored master keys, and exfiltrates via webhooks and uploads. It employs process killing to disable security, persistence mechanisms, obfuscation to hinder analysis, and anti-debugging techniques. The behavior aligns with known info-stealer malware with sabotage capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious malware with extensive data theft, sabotage, and exfiltration functionalities. Its obfuscation level and behavior justify a high malware score. The presence of anti-analysis, persistence, and data exfiltration tactics confirm its malicious intent and high threat level.",
