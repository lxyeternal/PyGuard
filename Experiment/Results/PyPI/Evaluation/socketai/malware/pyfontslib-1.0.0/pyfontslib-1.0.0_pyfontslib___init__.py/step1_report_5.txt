{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious data theft, including harvesting cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive information from the user's system and browsers, and exfiltrating it via webhooks or file uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, browser profile directories, local database files (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'History', 'Web Data'), clipboard contents, process lists, system info commands, and user input.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (webhooks, transfer.sh, anonfiles), writes data to local files, zips and uploads entire directories, kills processes, and executes system commands such as 'taskkill'.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser databases, clipboard, environment variables, or system commands flow into decryption routines, then into data collection variables. Collected data is then sent via HTTP requests or saved locally, often after obfuscation or encoding. Some data flows into multiple exfiltration functions including file upload, webhook posting, and zipping.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive use of obfuscated or misleading variable names, functions for process termination and registry checks indicating anti-analysis techniques, attempts to disable or remove security tools, and logic to check for VM or sandbox environments. Also, the code manipulates clipboard for crypto addresses and wallets, possibly for replacement or theft.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: it collects credentials, cookies, tokens, browser history, and system info; decrypts stored passwords and cookies using master keys and system APIs; exfiltrates data through HTTP POST requests to specified webhooks and uploads; creates ZIP archives of collected data for exfiltration; manipulates clipboard data to replace crypto addresses; kills security or monitoring processes; checks system environment for virtualization or analysis indicators; and automatically executes on startup if configured. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, suspicious process termination routines, and the focus on collecting sensitive user data strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also uses obfuscation techniques and system manipulations typical of malware scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious in nature, designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data (credentials, cookies, tokens, system info), potentially for identity theft or unauthorized account access. It includes features to avoid detection, disable security tools, and hide its activity. The code exhibits high malicious intent and should be considered extremely dangerous, with a malware score close to 1 and security risk at or near maximum. It is a clear threat and should be blocked or removed from any environment where found.",
