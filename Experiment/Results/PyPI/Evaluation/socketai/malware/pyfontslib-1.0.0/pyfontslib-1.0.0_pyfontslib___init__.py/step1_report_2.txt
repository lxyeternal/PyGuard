{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed for data theft, including browser data, cookies, passwords, tokens, system information, and potentially cryptocurrency wallets, then exfiltrates this data via webhooks or uploads.",
  "sources": "User input from clipboard, environment variables, files (browser databases, system info), process lists, and network requests for system info and token validation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs (webhook), file uploads, clipboard manipulation, process termination, system modifications, and data writing to files.",
  "flows": "Sources such as clipboard, files, system commands, and environment variables feed into data extraction functions; extracted data flows into network requests or file writes; data is then uploaded or sent via HTTP POST to external servers/webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes aggressive browser data extraction, token stealing, process termination, process hiding, process injection, self-executing startup persistence, data exfiltration via multiple network requests, and obfuscated code segments. Presence of hardcoded URLs, credentials, and extensive system info collection indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malware toolkit with functions for stealing browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and Roblox cookies; extracting system info; collecting tokens from various applications; capturing screenshots; and exfiltrating data through webhooks or uploads. It terminates security tools and disables protections, indicating sabotage. The code is heavily obfuscated in parts, and the logic aims to maximize data exfiltration from various sources while hiding activity. The presence of hardcoded cryptic URLs, tokens, and system info gathering suggests malicious intent. The script also manipulates the clipboard to replace crypto addresses, likely for cryptocurrency theft. Overall, it exhibits high malicious activity and technical sophistication geared toward stealth and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious malware designed for extensive data exfiltration, including sensitive credentials, tokens, system info, and financial data, combined with sabotage tactics such as process termination and system modifications. It communicates with external servers/webhooks for data theft. It poses an extremely high security risk and should be considered highly dangerous.",
