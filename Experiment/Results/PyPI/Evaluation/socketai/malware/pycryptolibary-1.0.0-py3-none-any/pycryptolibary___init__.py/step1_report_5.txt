{
  "purpose": "The code appears to function as a malicious data stealer, collecting sensitive user information such as browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system details, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses, then exfiltrating the data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Multiple sources include environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browsers' Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data, sqlite databases), clipboard content (via pyperclip), process enumeration (psutil), and network requests to external services (IP info, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network endpoints (Discord webhooks, transfer.sh, anonymous file uploads), local file writes (text files, zip archives), and clipboard modifications (wallet address replacements). The code also performs process termination, directory copying, and file zipping for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser data files, clipboard, system info commands, and network info to sinks such as network uploads (webhooks, file uploads), file system exfiltration (zip, txt files), and clipboard manipulation (wallet address replacement). Specific functions process stored credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info, then send or archive them for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL pointing to a suspicious domain, extensive use of obfuscated or inconsistent variable names, multiple attempts to kill processes (like chrome.exe, discord processes), collection of tokens and cookies from various browsers, and inclusion of a large list of process names and PC identifiers for stealth. The code also self-terminates based on environment checks, and the presence of code that interacts with system registry and process lists indicates an anti-analysis or anti-debugging effort.",
  "analysis": "The script combines multiple modules that perform credential theft from browsers, dump cookies, extract system and network info, scrape tokens from browser files, and potentially monitor or manipulate clipboard data to replace wallet addresses with pre-configured ones. It also checks for virtual machine indicators and suspicious processes, then terminates them if found. Collected data is packaged into files and zipped archives, then uploaded to external URLs or Discord via webhooks, which are hardcoded to suspicious domains. The code also includes functions for process termination, process enumeration, and environment checks, all typical of stealthy malware. The use of functions like 'decrypt_val', reading browser's 'Local State', and scanning directories for specific filenames further confirm credential harvesting. The inclusion of anti-debug and VM detection techniques suggests an attempt to evade analysis. Overall, the code operates with malicious intent, stealing user data, system info, and wallet addresses, then exfiltrating them covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system reconnaissance. It uses multiple methods to collect sensitive information from browsers and the system, then transmits the data via webhooks and file uploads to suspicious domains. Its anti-analysis measures and process-killing features indicate an intent to evade detection and persistence. Overall, this code should be classified as malware with high malicious intent.",
