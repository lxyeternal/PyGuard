  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and system information from a Windows machine, then send this data to a remote server via Discord webhooks and upload files to external services. It also includes functionalities for process killing, process detection, and file zipping, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser profile directories (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Brave, etc.), cookies, password databases, local state files, and system environment variables. Reads process information via psutil, environment variables for system info, and clipboard contents via pyperclip.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to specified Discord webhook URLs, uploads files to external sites like transfer.sh, and exfiltrates tokens, cookies, passwords, system info, and screenshots to remote endpoints. Writes data into files and zips before exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from browser databases, environment variables, clipboard, system info functions (UUID, IP, etc.), decrypted with master keys or crypt functions, stored in variables or files, then sent to external servers via HTTP requests. Data flows from sources (browsers, system info, clipboard) through decryption/parsing functions, then to sinks (webhook posts, file uploads).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive data exfiltration including browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info with no user consent or obvious legitimate purpose. It kills security-related processes (e.g., process hacker, regedit), disables security features (via registry or file modifications), and includes obfuscated, malware-like functions for process termination, process hiding, and system info collection. It creates zip archives of data and uploads to external sites, characteristic of a data theft and malware behavior. Additionally, the code is heavily obfuscated with numerous suspicious functions, hardcoded URLs, and automated data collection mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious info stealer targeting Windows systems. It extracts browser data such as cookies, passwords, history, credit cards, and tokens by copying browser files, decrypting stored encrypted data with master keys, and parsing SQLite databases. It collects system information including UUID, IP, location, and system specs. It also captures a screenshot of the system. Collected data is exfiltrated via Discord webhook messages with embedded info and files, as well as uploaded to external services like transfer.sh. The code kills security and debugging processes, disables Discord protection, and modifies certain browser or system files to disable security features. It includes code for process detection, process termination, and self-startup persistence. All activities are performed without user consent, with evident focus on data theft, system espionage, and evasion of detection, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a sophisticated, multi-functional information stealer and system intruder designed to harvest sensitive user data, system info, and tokens, then exfiltrate them via external and Discord webhook channels. It disables security measures, kills security processes, and performs activities consistent with malware, ransomware, or espionage tools. Its structure and behavior confirm malicious intent with high confidence.",
