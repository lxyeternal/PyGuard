{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info stealer, collecting cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and screenshots, then exfiltrating via webhooks and file uploads. It also kills security processes and disables protections.",
  "sources": "Browser data files (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.), registry keys, clipboard content, environment variables, process lists, system commands, and local system info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhooks, file uploads (zip archives), screenshots saved locally, and system info logs. It also terminates processes and disables security tools.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources (browser databases, registry, clipboard, system info), decrypted or parsed, then sent over network via webhooks or uploaded files. Process management routines kill security processes and disable protections.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive credential/token harvesting, process termination of security tools, disabling system protections, obfuscation in variable names, and covert exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive data theft: decrypts stored passwords, extracts cookies, tokens, browser history, and system info. It captures screenshots, terminates security processes, disables protections, and exfiltrates all data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process killing, and disabling security features confirms malicious intent. Some variable names are misleading, and obfuscation is minimal but present, aligning with a low obfuscation score. The malware score of 1 is justified by the extensive malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for data theft, system sabotage, and covert exfiltration. It exhibits behaviors typical of malware, with high potential for harm. The assigned malware score of 1, obfuscation around 0.3, and security risk of 1 are consistent with its functionality.",
