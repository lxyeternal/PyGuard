{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data theft, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and browser information, as well as exfiltrating files, screenshots, and system info. It also includes capabilities to disable security features and kill processes related to debugging and security tools.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser data files (cookies, passwords, history, credit cards), clipboard contents, system environment variables, local and roaming app data directories, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a specified Discord webhook URL, and files are uploaded to anonymous file hosting services. Specific functions exfiltrate system info, browser data, tokens, cookies, passwords, and screenshots.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various sources such as browser databases, clipboard, environment variables, and system commands to in-memory variables. These are then formatted into JSON payloads or files and sent over the network to remote endpoints, primarily via webhook POST requests or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Indicators of malicious intent include the use of hardcoded webhook URLs, automatic installation of numerous potentially unnecessary libraries, code designed to kill security and debugging processes, collection of sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and system info, and uploading of files and system screenshots. There are also obfuscated and misleading variable names, inclusion of backdoor-like functionality, and the presence of potentially malicious configuration options (e.g., disabling security features). The code bypasses security and anti-debug measures, which is typical for malware.",
  "analysis": "The script installs numerous Python packages automatically, which suggests an attempt to ensure all dependencies are present. It collects system information, environment variables, and active processes, then searches for and decrypts stored browser credentials, cookies, and tokens, particularly from Chrome, Firefox, and Roblox. It has functions to exfiltrate data via Discord webhook or anonymous file hosting. The code includes mechanisms to disable or remove security tools and process kill commands, indicating an intent to evade detection. The overall structure and payloads strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, with embedded capabilities for persistence and obfuscation. The code’s design, including hardcoded webhook URLs, file encryption/decryption, and process management, align with typical malware features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior typical of information-stealing malware. It automates the theft of cookies, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive data, exfiltrates this data to external servers, disables security tools, and runs covertly. It appears intended for targeted data harvesting, privacy invasion, and system compromise. Its overall security risk score is high.",
