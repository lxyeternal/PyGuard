{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malware framework designed for data theft, system information gathering, credential extraction, browser data theft, process killing, and exfiltration via Discord webhook and file uploads. It also includes mechanisms to disable security features and evade detection.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system commands, browser profile files, database files (Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), process lists, clipboard data, and specific registry entries.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include HTTP requests to external URLs (Discord webhook, transfer.sh, anonfiles), file writing for credentials and cookies, zip file creation, process termination commands, clipboard modification, and process killing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, environment variables, and clipboard; is decrypted or read; then sent via HTTP POST or file upload to external servers; also, malicious code manipulates system processes and registry to disable security or evade detection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include extensive credential harvesting, browser data theft, process termination of security tools, self-startup modification, disabling security features, and obfuscation of URLs and code logic. Hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive use of cryptographic functions, and systematic collection of system info are suspicious. Additionally, the code aggressively kills certain processes, deletes files, and zips collected data for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code actively searches for sensitive data including browser passwords, cookies, history, and credit card info by copying database files and decrypting stored credentials. It harvests tokens from Discord and other applications by parsing local files and SQLite databases. It exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and file uploads, often using obfuscated or hardcoded URLs. It also disables security mechanisms like process killers, registry checks for VM or sandbox detection, and modifies system files or registry keys to prevent detection. The presence of hardcoded URLs, extensive credential and token harvesting, process termination commands targeting security tools, and disabling of security features all point toward malicious intent. The code’s purpose aligns with typical malware behavior, with clear data theft, system sabotage, and persistence mechanisms.",
