  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code handles URL parsing, header validation, encoding, cookies, and response streaming securely. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (accurate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (accurate)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate given the thorough review)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis appears correct. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP handling, with no signs of malicious code. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the handling of untrusted inputs, but still within normal bounds.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (reasonable considering external input handling)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious indicators; the risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms standard request/response processing, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. High confidence, minimal risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, justified)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Verdict:** The conclusion aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard patterns, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also finds no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, with standard request/response handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware or malicious activity (score 0). The code is part of the well-known Requests library, handling standard HTTP mechanics.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the code's nature—handling untrusted inputs like URLs, headers, and files—but these are standard practices in HTTP client libraries.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for libraries handling untrusted data but no active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP request/response handling with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's integrity and safety within the context of supply chain security.",
