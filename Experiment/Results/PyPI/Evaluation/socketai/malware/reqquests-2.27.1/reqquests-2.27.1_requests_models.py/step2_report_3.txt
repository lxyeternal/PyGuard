  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Describes core classes and functions for HTTP request/response handling. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The confidence level is high (1).  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard request/response handling. Notes minimal security risk (0.2), but no malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk likely reflects the general exposure of request handling code, which could be misused if inputs are malicious. However, no malicious behavior is present. The confidence is high (0.95).  \n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the nature of request handling, but no malware or obfuscation. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard request/response classes, with detailed handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation. High confidence (0.95).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The very low risk score aligns with the code's purpose. No signs of malicious intent.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard request/response processing. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. Slightly higher risk (0.1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's function.  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk (0.2).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Given the nature of request handling code, these scores are reasonable.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent. The code is a standard HTTP request/response handler with no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, considering that request handling code can be misused if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, inherent to request handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are consistent, and their scores accurately reflect the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard part of the Requests library, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
