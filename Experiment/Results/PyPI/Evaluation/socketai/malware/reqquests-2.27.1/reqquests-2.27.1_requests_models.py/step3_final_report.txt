{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating URL parsing, header management, encoding, cookies, and response streaming.",
  "sources": "URL parsing and normalization, header validation, encoding functions, cookie handling, request data and files input, JSON serialization, and response content reading.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL components, headers, cookies, request body (including JSON and files), and response content, which could potentially lead to data leaks or injection if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data from URL, headers, cookies, files, JSON, and request parameters flow through encoding, validation, and preparation functions, culminating in the construction of the request body and headers. Response content flows from raw network data through decoding and parsing functions to accessible properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code adheres to standard practices for HTTP request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP request and response handling, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding of parameters and files, cookie management, and response streaming. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on established libraries and handles untrusted inputs in a typical manner. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the handling of untrusted data, which is inherent to HTTP client libraries but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard operational risks without active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard component of the Requests library, performing typical HTTP request and response processing securely. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use.",
