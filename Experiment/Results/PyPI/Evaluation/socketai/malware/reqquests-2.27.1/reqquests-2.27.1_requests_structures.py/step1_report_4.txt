{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures (CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict) to handle HTTP headers and lookup functionalities in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, methods that set, get, delete items, and update internal dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Methods that access or modify internal state such as __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, update, and get.",
  "flows": "Input data through constructors or method calls flows into internal _store or __dict__ objects; these are then used for data retrieval or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages HTTP headers case-insensitively while preserving original case, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary with a custom __repr__ and get method. Both classes operate purely on internal data structures (OrderedDict and dict). They do not include network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The methods follow standard patterns for Python data structures and do not execute external code or perform insecure actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries for HTTP headers and lookup purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
