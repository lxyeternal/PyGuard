{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive dictionary-like object and a simple lookup dictionary for internal use within HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the constructor parameters, internal attributes (_store), and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; purely internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization through update and setitem methods, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Minor issue in the copy() method of CaseInsensitiveDict: it returns CaseInsensitiveDict(self._store.values()), which may not produce a proper copy. Should be 'return CaseInsensitiveDict(self)' or 'return CaseInsensitiveDict(self.items())'.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, straightforward data structures using Python collections. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behaviors are present. The only technical concern is the copy() method, which could be improved for correctness but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and intended for internal use. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minor issue in the copy() method should be corrected for proper functionality but does not impact security.",
