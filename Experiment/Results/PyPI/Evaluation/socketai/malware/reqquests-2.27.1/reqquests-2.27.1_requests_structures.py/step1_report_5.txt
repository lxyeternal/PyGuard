  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization of CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict instances.",
  "sinks": "Accessors such as __getitem__, get, and iteration methods that retrieve stored data.",
  "flows": "Data passed into constructors → stored in internal dictionaries → retrieved via key-based accessors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The classes serve as data containers without external communications or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict for case-insensitive key management, and LookupDict as a simple named dictionary. Both classes implement standard dictionary behaviors. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network activity is present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The code adheres to normal Python practices for data structures and does not perform any harmful operations or contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data structure implementations intended for internal use within requests or similar HTTP handling modules. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
