{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility handling for import differences between Python 2 and Python 3, specifically for URL parsing, JSON handling, and cookie management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, collections, and collections.abc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; all imports are standard library or well-known packages, with no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports modules that facilitate compatibility; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward compatibility handling with standard modules. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules based on Python version, ensuring compatibility across Python 2 and 3. Uses try-except blocks for optional module imports. Defines type aliases and imports necessary functions/classes for URL handling, JSON processing, and cookie management. No malicious code or suspicious logic is present. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for supporting multiple Python versions. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no indicators of supply chain attacks.",
