{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility support between Python 2 and Python 3 by managing imports and type definitions specific to each version.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, optional dependencies (chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json), and version detection logic.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external communications; only import statements and type assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer, using try-except blocks for optional dependencies and conditional imports based on Python version. It only manages module imports and type definitions without any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim for supporting multiple Python versions. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
