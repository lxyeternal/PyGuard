{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions (2 and 3) for HTTP requests, encoding, and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, json, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, collections, and json-related modules.",
  "sinks": "Imports are used for handling URLs, JSON parsing, cookies, and string buffers, which are standard for compatibility and data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules (e.g., json, urllib) into the code’s runtime functions; no direct untrusted data flow is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on conditional imports and definitions based on Python version detection, ensuring compatibility across Python 2 and 3. It handles optional imports such as chardet/charset_normalizer and simplejson/json, setting flags accordingly. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute dynamic code. All imports are standard libraries or widely-used external dependencies, with proper fallbacks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or unusual logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module used in Python projects for cross-version support. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
