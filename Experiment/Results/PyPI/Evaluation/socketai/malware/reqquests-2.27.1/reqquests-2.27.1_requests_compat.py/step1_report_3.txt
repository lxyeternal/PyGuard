{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests library, including imports and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys for version info, and various standard libraries depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily handles module imports and type definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only sets up compatibility layers and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard compatibility code for a widely used library.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version and conditionally imports modules and defines types accordingly. It handles optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, with fallbacks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling is present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious functions. Overall, it is safe.",
