{
  "purpose": "Handle import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests.compat module, providing unified access to common functions and classes across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party packages (chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, collections).",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily imports modules and sets up compatibility wrappers.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from external sources into internal namespace, establishing compatibility layers; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules based on Python version, adjusting for differences between Python 2 and 3. It includes fallbacks for optional third-party modules like simplejson and chardet. All imports are from standard or well-known external libraries and are used to establish cross-version compatibility. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure and content are typical for such compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim for requests.compat, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to unify module imports across Python versions.",
