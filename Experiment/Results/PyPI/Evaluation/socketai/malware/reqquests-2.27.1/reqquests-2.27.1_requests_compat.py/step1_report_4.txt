{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests library, handling imports and type definitions to ensure cross-version functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and attempts to import optional modules such as chardet, simplejson, and various URL and cookie handling modules depending on the Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data in a potentially harmful way. The code primarily imports modules and defines compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading system info (Python version), then conditionally importing modules and defining types accordingly, with no data processing or transmission activities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is standard for compatibility layers and does not perform any external actions beyond imports.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by detecting the Python version to manage compatibility. It conditionally imports modules based on Python 2 or 3, including optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson. It redefines certain built-in types and exceptions for cross-version compatibility. All operations are standard import statements and type definitions with no suspicious logic or data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a typical compatibility shim, with no network activity, data leaks, or external influence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer without malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages imports and type definitions to support cross-version Python code. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities.",
