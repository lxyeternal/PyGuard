  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim that manipulates module references for legacy support. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal. Proper environment integrity measures should be maintained to prevent exploitation, but the code itself is safe."
