  "flows": "Importing modules, then rewriting sys.modules entries for specific modules to maintain compatibility and module identity",
  "anomalies": "Reassigning sys.modules entries to rewrite module paths; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'chardet' with a fallback to 'charset_normalizer' and suppresses related warnings. It then modifies sys.modules entries for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' (or 'charset_normalizer') to preserve module identity across different package structures, especially for legacy compatibility with requests. This practice is known to be used for compatibility but can sometimes be suspicious if used maliciously; however, here, it appears to be for ensuring module references remain consistent. No external data input or output, no network activity, and no cryptographic operations are present. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears benign and intended for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for backward compatibility, ensuring consistent module references across different package structures. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code modifies internal module mappings to maintain compatibility but does not perform any malicious actions.",
