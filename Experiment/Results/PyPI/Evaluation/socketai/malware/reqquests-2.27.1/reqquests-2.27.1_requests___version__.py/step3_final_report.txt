  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' library, including version, author, description, and stylistic comments.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string and integer values to module-level variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments with no dynamic or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and Unicode emojis as stylistic comments; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The ASCII art and emojis are benign stylistic choices. Multiple reports correctly identify the code as static, harmless, with no malicious intent. Scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and static nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign package metadata snippet with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
