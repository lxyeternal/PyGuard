{
  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for a Python package named 'requests'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code consists of straightforward variable assignments and a comment block.",
  "analysis": "The script solely contains metadata attributes typical for a Python package's setup or metadata module. It includes descriptive information and does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All variables are statically assigned, and there are no dynamic or runtime behaviors that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for the 'requests' library, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears safe and intentional as part of a legitimate package.",
