  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present",
  "flows": "N/A - static metadata assignments, no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of metadata variables with static string assignments",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string and integer values to package metadata variables. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external data handling. The content appears to be typical package metadata setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity are evident. The initial comment block is ASCII art but does not impact code behavior and seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package metadata definition with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package setup.",
