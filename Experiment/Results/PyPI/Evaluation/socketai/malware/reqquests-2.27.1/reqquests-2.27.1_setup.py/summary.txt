  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or malware detected. The main concern is the use of 'exec()' to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The package name 'reqquests' warrants verification but is likely a typo. Overall, the security risk is low, with scores reflecting minor concerns."
