  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the 'requests' library, including mock classes for request and response objects, functions to extract, manage, and manipulate cookies, and a custom cookie jar implementation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTTP response headers (`response._original_response.msg`) and request headers (`request` objects). Cookie data is extracted from response headers and cookies are set via provided functions.",
  "sinks": "Cookies are added to requests (`get_cookie_header`), stored in cookie jars (`set`, `set_cookie`), or removed (`remove_cookie_by_name`). Cookies are also created or updated through functions like `create_cookie`, `cookiejar_from_dict`, and `merge_cookies`. No data is sent over the network directly from this code.",
  "flows": "Input headers and request objects → cookie extraction functions (`extract_cookies_to_jar`) → cookies stored in cookie jars → cookies retrieved or manipulated for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code predominantly deals with cookie management. The use of try-except for threading import and the design for compatibility suggest typical patterns. No suspicious URL or network activity is embedded. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present. The cookie handling methods are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling utilities, including mock classes to interface with cookie management libraries, functions to extract cookies from responses, and methods to manage cookies within a cookie jar. It supports setting, getting, deleting, and merging cookies, with no evident malicious behaviors. The functions operate locally on cookie data without external network communication or sensitive data handling beyond standard cookie management. The structure and implementation follow typical patterns for cookie handling, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious injections. All components appear to serve legitimate purposes related to HTTP cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a compatibility and utility layer for cookie management, following typical patterns and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
