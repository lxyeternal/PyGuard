  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, and compatibility wrappers for cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Request objects (headers, URL parsing), response headers (msg), cookie dictionaries, request URL, request headers.",
  "sinks": "Headers added to requests, cookie jars, response headers, internal cookie storage.",
  "flows": "Input from request headers and URL into cookie objects and jars; cookies stored or retrieved via headers and cookie jar methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, creation, deletion, and merging functions. It handles cookie data carefully, with error handling for conflicts and unexpected arguments. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present; the code is clear and well-structured. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The functions operate on typical data flows for cookie handling, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
