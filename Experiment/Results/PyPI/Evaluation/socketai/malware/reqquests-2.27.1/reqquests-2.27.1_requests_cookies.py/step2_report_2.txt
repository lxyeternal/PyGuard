  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code manages cookies via request/response objects, headers, and cookie jars. Data flows are standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The functions are typical for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears safe, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0.2 (probably due to the general nature of cookie handling, but minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and no issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, with standard cookie utilities, extraction, and management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns. No network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also consistent. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk very low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable; the code is typical cookie management code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions/classes for cookie management, with mock classes for compatibility.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard, safe, with high confidence (1.0). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar utility functions for cookies, with standard data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. Malware score 0, security risk minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, standard cookie utilities and management functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Data flows are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with high confidence (1.0). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, generally around 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal security concern as this is utility code.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** The code is a standard, well-implemented cookie management utility with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard cookie handling, no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:** The code performs typical cookie management functions, with proper error handling and compatibility features. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate.
