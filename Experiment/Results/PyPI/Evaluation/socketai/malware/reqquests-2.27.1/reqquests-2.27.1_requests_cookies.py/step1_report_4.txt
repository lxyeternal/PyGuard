{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes to manage cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, management, and compatibility with different cookie handling interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from request headers, response headers, and cookie dictionaries. Cookies are created from input parameters and cookies are extracted from response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookies are added to headers for requests (get_cookie_header), cookies are stored in cookie jars, and cookies are potentially removed or updated. No direct data leaks or external communication occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into a cookie jar; cookies can be retrieved or set from the jar; cookie creation functions generate cookie objects from input data; cookies can be merged or removed based on specified criteria.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code follows typical cookie management patterns. No unsafe use of environment variables or code injection points are evident. The only potential concern is the general handling of cookies, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for cookie management, including mock request/response wrappers for compatibility, cookie extraction, creation, and management functions. It uses standard libraries and practices. No malicious code, external network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform expected cookie handling tasks without any suspicious behavior or anomalies. The code structure and logic are typical for a library designed for cookie handling. No obfuscation or hidden functionality detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs legitimate cookie handling tasks consistent with its purpose.",
