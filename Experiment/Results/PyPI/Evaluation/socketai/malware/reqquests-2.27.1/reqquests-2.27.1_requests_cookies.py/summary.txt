  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
