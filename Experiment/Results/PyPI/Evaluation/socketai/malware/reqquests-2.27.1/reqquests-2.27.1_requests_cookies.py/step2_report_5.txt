  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes standard cookie management functions, extracting cookies from responses, setting headers, etc.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is typical for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to general complexity but no actual risk).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar findings: standard cookie utilities, no malicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: utility functions, mock classes, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard cookie management code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous: utility functions, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is standard cookie management utilities, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; all reports assign malware score 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports assign obfuscated score 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs typical cookie handling, extraction, creation, and management functions.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The low risk scores are appropriate given the functionality.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal complexity but no actual risk)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and their thorough analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose and content. No adjustments needed.",
