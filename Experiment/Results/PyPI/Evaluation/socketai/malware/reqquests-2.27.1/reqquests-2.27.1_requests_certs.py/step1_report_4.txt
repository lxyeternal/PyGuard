{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for verification of SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and calls it when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'where()' is printed to standard output, which could potentially be captured or redirected.",
  "flows": "The source 'where()' function provides the path to the CA bundle; the path is then printed, potentially exposing its location if the output is captured.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors; the code simply retrieves and displays a standard certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard function from a well-known library ('certifi') to retrieve the path of the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. There are no indications of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical usage patterns for SSL verification support. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle location used by requests, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
