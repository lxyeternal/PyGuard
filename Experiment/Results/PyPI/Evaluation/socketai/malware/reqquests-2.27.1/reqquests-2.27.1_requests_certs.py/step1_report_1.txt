{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the 'certifi' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code simply prints a trusted file path.",
  "flows": "Input source is the 'where()' function call, which retrieves a static CA bundle path; output is the printed path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs a straightforward retrieval and print of a trusted resource path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value. This is a simple utility to display the CA bundle location. No user input, no network activity, no data manipulation or security-sensitive operations are present. The code relies on a well-known, trusted library ('certifi') and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to output the path of the trusted CA certificate bundle. It contains no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious activities.",
