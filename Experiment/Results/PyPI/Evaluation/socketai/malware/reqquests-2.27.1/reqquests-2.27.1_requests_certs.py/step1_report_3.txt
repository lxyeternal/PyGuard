{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple utility to output the default CA certificate bundle path used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path via 'where()' imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "The printed output could potentially be used to reveal the location of CA certificates on the system but does not lead to direct data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source 'where()' provides data that is then printed to standard output, which could be captured or misused if combined with other tools, but alone this is benign.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and prints the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. It contains no user input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. Its purpose is solely to display the location of the CA bundle used by requests or other libraries that rely on certifi.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for utility purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
