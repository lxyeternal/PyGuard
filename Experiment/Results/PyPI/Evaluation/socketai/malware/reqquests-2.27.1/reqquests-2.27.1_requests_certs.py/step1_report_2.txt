{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package via the import statement and the call to 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (printing the CA bundle path). No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved in malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides the path to the CA bundle, which is printed to standard output; no untrusted input or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs a simple, standard operation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints its value if executed directly. There are no input processing, data manipulation, or network activities. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for obtaining the default CA bundle location. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package. It contains no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
