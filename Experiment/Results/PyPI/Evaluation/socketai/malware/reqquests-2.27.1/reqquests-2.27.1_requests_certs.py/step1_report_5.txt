{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to output the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, primarily used for SSL/TLS verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output (the CA bundle path) could be used by other components for SSL/TLS connections; no direct untrusted data input or sensitive data leakage is present.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' from certifi and prints the result, with no further data flow or untrusted data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. The script is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from the certifi package and, when executed as the main module, prints the CA bundle path. It does not process user input, read untrusted data, or perform any network or system modifications. The purpose is informational, to reveal the default CA bundle location. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path provided by certifi. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The code is simple, clear, and secure.",
