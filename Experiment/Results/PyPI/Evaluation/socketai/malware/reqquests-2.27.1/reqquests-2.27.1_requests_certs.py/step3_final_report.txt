  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi'; execution of 'print(where())' when run as a script.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> calling 'where()' -> printing the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and relies on a trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It performs no data manipulation, network activity, or user input. The purpose is purely informational. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, simple, and relies on well-known, trusted components. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident. The output could reveal system-specific paths but does not pose a security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
