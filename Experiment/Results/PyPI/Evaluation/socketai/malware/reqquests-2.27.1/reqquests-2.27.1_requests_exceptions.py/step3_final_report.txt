  "purpose": "Defines exception and warning classes for handling HTTP request errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions do not involve data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to HTTP request handling. It imports external exception classes and defines subclasses for specific error types. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, network interactions, or malicious constructs. The structure is standard for an exception module, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign exception handling module for the Requests library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and reflect its safe, structural purpose.",
