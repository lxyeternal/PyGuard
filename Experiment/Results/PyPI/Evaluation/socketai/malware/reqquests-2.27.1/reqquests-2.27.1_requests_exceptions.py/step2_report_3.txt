  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard exception module defining classes for error handling in the Requests library.\n- No external input, data flows, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code only defines exception classes, imports, and warnings.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n- **Purpose and analysis:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no dynamic or risky behavior.\n- **Sources and sinks:** No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- **Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, since no security risk or malicious activity is present.\n\n**Final justification:**\n- The code is a typical exception class definitions module for the Requests library.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- Import statements and class structures are standard.\n- No dynamic code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard exception handling module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All evidence supports a clean assessment.",
