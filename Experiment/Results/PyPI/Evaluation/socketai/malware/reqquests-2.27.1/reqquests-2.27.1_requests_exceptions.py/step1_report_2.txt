  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3.exceptions and compat module; class definitions with potential initialization code.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising during error handling, especially in network requests; no explicit data sinks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes without data processing or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns observed; code follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions and custom base classes to represent various request-related errors. It imports exceptions from third-party modules, defines multiple specific exception classes, and includes warning classes. There is no data manipulation, input reading, or network activity within this code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions for error handling in the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and serves purely as error categorization infrastructure.",
