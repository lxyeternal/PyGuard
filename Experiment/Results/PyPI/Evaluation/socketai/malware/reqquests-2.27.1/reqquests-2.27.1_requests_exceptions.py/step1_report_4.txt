{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling errors and warnings in the Requests library, specifically for HTTP request-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input; it defines exception classes. No data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks are present; the code only defines exception classes and warnings.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as this is a static definition of exceptions and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, only defining exception and warning classes without dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling in the Requests library, including base exceptions, specific HTTP error types, and warnings. It imports standard exceptions from urllib3 and compatibility error classes. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data handling, nor any code that executes dynamically or interacts with system resources. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is standard for defining exception hierarchies in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition module for the Requests library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for error handling and warnings. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
