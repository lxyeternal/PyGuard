{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, mainly for error handling and warnings related to HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only defines classes and imports external exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, system manipulation, or information leakage are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines exception classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The structure is standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module, then defines multiple custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in the Requests library. All classes are straightforward, inheriting from base exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. The file appears to be a typical error handling module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception module for the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply defines and organizes error classes for HTTP request handling.",
