  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code solely defines exception classes for the Requests library.\n   - It imports exceptions from `urllib3.exceptions` and a compat module.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n   - The structure is standard for an exception module.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No external data sources or sinks that could be exploited.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low, which is justified because the code is purely structural and error handling.\n\n4. **Any Inconsistencies or Issues**:\n   - The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, safe exception class module.\n   - No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n   - The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My own estimate** after this review:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a typical, benign exception module with no security concerns. The scores are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
