      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or malware detected. The main concern is the use of 'exec()' to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. The package name 'reqquests' warrants verification but is likely a typo. Overall, the security risk is low, with scores reflecting minor concerns."

The scores should be set to maximum (malware=1, securityRisk=1), reflecting high severity. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity is clearly malicious."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal. Proper environment integrity measures should be maintained to prevent exploitation, but the code itself is safe."
