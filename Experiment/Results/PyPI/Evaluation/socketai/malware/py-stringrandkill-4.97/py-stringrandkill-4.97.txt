      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed stealthily during setup, indicating a significant security threat. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity. The high scores assigned are justified by the obfuscation, stealth, and potential for malicious actions."
