  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical indicators of malicious activity: obfuscated remote command execution triggered conditionally, with concealment tactics. Given the external URL, obfuscation, and silent execution, this package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, suitable for high malware and security risk scores."
