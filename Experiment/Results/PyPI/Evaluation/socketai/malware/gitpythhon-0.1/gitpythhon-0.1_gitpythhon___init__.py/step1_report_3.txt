  "purpose": "The code appears to be a general Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, and external files (if any), though no explicit source code provided to confirm.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or subprocess executions, but no explicit suspicious sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions, but without actual code, no definitive source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual variable naming are evident in the provided snippet, which is empty or missing.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is empty or missing; therefore, no analysis can be performed. Without actual code, it's impossible to identify sources, sinks, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. The code appears benign or not provided.",
