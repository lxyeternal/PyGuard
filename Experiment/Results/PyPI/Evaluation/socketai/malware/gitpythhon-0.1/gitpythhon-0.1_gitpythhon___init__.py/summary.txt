  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The reports largely provide accurate assessments aligned with observed behaviors. Suspicious features such as dynamic execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded communication justify higher malware and risk scores in certain reports. Overall, the security posture indicates moderate to high concern where behaviors are confirmed, with some reports correctly indicating benign code. The recommended adjustment is to elevate Report 1's malware score to 0.6 for consistency with its suspicious indicators, while other scores remain appropriate."
