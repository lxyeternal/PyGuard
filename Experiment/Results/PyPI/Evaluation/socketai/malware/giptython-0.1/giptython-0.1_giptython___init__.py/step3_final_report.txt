  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Reading from environment variables, user input, files, network connections, and possibly dynamic code execution points such as eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, system commands, or data exfiltration points, especially if untrusted data flows into these sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing functions into sinks such as network sockets or system commands, potentially via eval()/exec() or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated variable/function names, dynamic code execution, or suspicious string manipulations indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data processing patterns with no suspicious features in reports 1, 2, 4, and 5, supporting benign classification with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 indicates indicators such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic eval/exec usage, and obfuscation, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.8) scores. The analysis aligns with standard static analysis indicators, with no signs of false positives or overlooked anomalies. The scores are consistent with the described patterns and behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk, except for report 3, which shows strong indicators of malicious or risky behavior. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.",
