  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input data, environment configurations, data processing functions, network/file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, inputs) to sinks (network, files) potentially via processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious indicators observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal or missing, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of environment variables and data flows are typical and do not suggest malicious intent. The confidence levels are high where code is present, and low where code is absent, appropriately reflecting the available information. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippets and context, the dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate and aligns with the analysis. No further action is necessary unless new code or suspicious patterns are identified.",
