  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some data processing or setup based on variable usage, but the actual intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly defined; potential data sources include environment variables, external modules, or function inputs which are not specified in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmission functions, but no explicit such operations are shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths cannot be conclusively identified due to lack of context; no explicit source-to-sink paths are observable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are evident. The code structure appears standard without unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet appears to be minimal and lacks explicit input or output operations. Without additional context or full code, it’s difficult to trace data flows or identify malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file system manipulation, or credential handling are observable. The overall structure seems typical of normal Python code, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no obvious anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
