      "conclusion": "The code embeds an obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command with a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent. The setup code itself appears benign, but the payload's behavior is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. The high malware and risk scores are justified based on obfuscation, hidden execution, and external communication indicators."
