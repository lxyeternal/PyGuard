{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data theft, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, screenshots, and browser data, and exfiltrating this information via Discord webhooks and external file uploads. It also includes mechanisms to disable security tools, kill processes, and create zip archives of stolen data for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, browser profile directories, cookies, login databases, and clipboard content. It also reads configuration files such as 'Local State' and 'config.json'.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, uploading files to transfer.sh, and via external network requests to external URLs. Files are created locally for passwords, cookies, history, and credit card info, then uploaded or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and browser data flows from sources (browser storage, environment variables, clipboard) to sinks (HTTP requests, file uploads). The code decrypts stored credentials, captures screenshots, and posts data to remote servers. Data is collected, processed, saved locally, zipped, and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, extensive use of obfuscated or encrypted data, unusual process termination, and process-killing routines. The code actively kills security and debugging processes, modifies browser files, and disables protections. It also contains functions for password and cookie extraction, which are characteristic of malware behavior. The code is highly intrusive, with mechanisms to prevent detection and analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates comprehensive malicious behavior, including extracting sensitive user data from browsers and applications, decrypting encrypted credentials, capturing system info, and exfiltrating data through webhooks and file uploads. It uses environment variables and local files to gather system and user data, decrypts stored credentials with master keys, and manipulates browser files to access stored tokens and cookies. Additionally, it terminates security-related processes, disables protections, and ensures persistence. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and obfuscated or encrypted segments indicates an intent to evade detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including data theft, process termination, and anti-analysis measures.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly malicious, designed to steal a wide range of sensitive data from the user's system, disable security tools, and exfiltrate information covertly. It demonstrates extensive malicious capabilities with multiple data exfiltration points, system sabotage routines, and anti-detection mechanisms. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
