  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code appears to be designed for malicious activities including data theft, credential harvesting, browser data extraction, and exfiltration of sensitive information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info, while also potentially executing tasks like process termination, system monitoring, and file uploading to external servers.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input sources include environment variables (e.g., COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), clipboard data, browser database files (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), local system files (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'History', 'Web Data'), and process lists (to check running processes). Network requests to external URLs (webhook, data exfiltration endpoints, pastebin-like sites) are also present.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Data exfiltration points include HTTP POST requests to external webhooks and file uploads via requests, requests.post to transfer.sh, and possible file writes (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, system info) to local files before upload. Browser data and credentials are decrypted and stored locally, then sent externally.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Flow involves gathering system info and browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), decrypting encrypted data with master keys, collecting tokens and cookies, then exfiltrating via HTTP requests to external servers. It also monitors running processes, kills certain processes, and compresses/exfiltrates files from user directories, then uploads via external links. The script operates stealthily in background, hiding itself if configured.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code contains hardcoded addresses for addresses and addresses replacement, suspicious URL patterns (e.g., 'kekwltd.ru'), obfuscated or redundant code (e.g., multiple duplicate functions, complex regex patterns). It actively kills processes like 'chrome.exe' before collecting browser data, removes certain files, and uploads data in potentially large chunks. Use of untrusted external URLs, extensive environment variable use, and embedded decryption routines are suspicious. The code also performs checks to avoid execution on VM or debug environments, indicating anti-analysis measures. Many function names, comments, and variables hint at malicious intent, such as 'steal_passwords', 'steal_cookies', 'grab_mc', 'grab_roblox', 'bc_checking', and 'bc_uploadanonfiles'.\"\n  ],\n  \"analysis\": \"The script is structured as a sophisticated info-stealer targeting Windows systems, especially browsers and social media tokens. It decrypts stored credentials, cookies, and history from popular browsers, retrieves Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and possibly other gaming tokens, then compiles and uploads this data externally. It also can capture screenshots, gather system details, and monitor running processes to prevent analysis or terminate security tools. The code uses multiple obfuscated or complex regex patterns and encryption routines to decrypt data. The presence of hardcoded addresses, excessive external requests, and file uploads strongly suggest malicious intent. Anti-debugging and VM checks are used to evade detection. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive information and exfiltrate it to controlled servers, characteristic of malware or remote access trojans (RATs).\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code demonstrates malicious behavior, primarily focused on data theft from browsers, social media accounts, and the system, along with exfiltration to external servers. It contains obfuscation techniques, process-killing routines, and anti-analysis measures, making it highly suspicious. Its purpose is aligned with malware or info-stealing trojans aimed at compromising user privacy and system security.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.7,\n  \"malware\": 1,\n  \"securityRisk\": 1\n}",
