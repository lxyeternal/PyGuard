{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and browser data from the host system, and then exfiltrate this data to remote servers via HTTP POST requests. It also includes malicious functionalities like process killing, process hiding, and file zipping for data exfiltration, indicating intent to compromise and steal user data.",
  "sources": "User input sources include clipboard content (via pyperclip), local files (browser databases, history, cookies, passwords), environment variables, and system commands (via subprocess). Data is also collected from system info, installed programs, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points include HTTP POST requests to specific webhook URLs, uploading files to external services (transfer.sh), and sending encrypted/decrypted credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info. Files are zipped and uploaded, and data is written into files before upload.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data flows from sources (browser databases, clipboard, system info, process lists) through functions that decrypt or collect this data, then stored temporarily or directly sent via HTTP POST or file upload. For example, passwords and cookies are extracted from SQLite databases, then formatted and uploaded to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes persistent process termination (kill process commands), process hiding mechanisms, extensive data collection from multiple browsers, system info, and tokens, and use of obfuscated or indirect methods for decryption and exfiltration. Hardcoded URLs, extensive use of threading, and cryptographic operations for decrypting stored credentials are suspicious. The script also installs dependencies dynamically via os.system calls and attempts to hide its presence.",
  "analysis": "The script operates as a malicious info stealer, designed to harvest credentials, cookies, tokens, browser data, system info, and files. It collects data from multiple browsers and applications, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using system cryptographic functions, and exfiltrates the information via Discord webhooks and file uploads to external hosting services. The code also includes mechanisms to prevent execution in virtual environments or sandboxing, kill antivirus or debugging processes, and hide itself from detection. Its purpose aligns with typical malware, spyware, or trojan behaviors, with a focus on data theft and stealth.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent as a comprehensive info-stealer and exfiltration tool, designed to compromise user data, evade detection, and transmit stolen information to remote servers. Its structure, functions, and behaviors strongly suggest malicious activity, with no benign purpose evident.",
