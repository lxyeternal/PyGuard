{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly malicious information stealer, designed to extract cookies, passwords, tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency addresses from the victim's system. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, terminates security processes, disables protections, and employs obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser profile directories, SQLite databases (Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), clipboard content, registry keys, system commands, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and transfer.sh, file uploads (zip archives), local file storage of stolen data, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources (browser files, environment variables, clipboard), decrypted or parsed, then transmitted via network requests or saved locally. The code decrypts stored credentials, harvests tokens, captures system info, and exfiltrates the data, often after obfuscation or encryption routines. It also kills security processes to disable protections.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, active process killing routines, disabling of security tools, obfuscation through encrypted URLs and complex regex, extensive data collection routines, anti-debugging checks, and stealth measures such as process hiding and VM detection.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity: decrypting stored credentials, harvesting tokens and cookies, collecting system info, replacing clipboard content with crypto addresses, compressing and exfiltrating data, and actively killing security processes. The presence of obfuscation routines and anti-analysis checks further supports its malicious intent. The functions are consistent with a comprehensive info-stealer and sabotage tool designed to operate stealthily and persistently.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a highly malicious malware designed for extensive data theft, system sabotage, and stealthy exfiltration. It employs multiple anti-analysis and anti-detection techniques, actively disables security measures, and exfiltrates sensitive information via webhooks and uploads. The overall behavior and capabilities confirm a high threat level.",
