  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing modules, executing decryption and code execution during install run",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec, potentially malicious behavior",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers import of requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes embedded code",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, dynamic execution of decrypted code, obfuscated variable names and class names, minimal descriptive metadata",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package named 'Matplorlib'. It includes a custom install command that, on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts a payload using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, as executing decrypted code during installation can run arbitrary and hidden malicious instructions. The encrypted payload and the obfuscated class and variable names further suggest malicious intent to hide behavior. The setup_requires list includes 'fernet' and 'requests', but these are common libraries, and their presence alone is not suspicious. The overall pattern of decrypting and executing code during setup is a common tactic in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, likely designed to run arbitrary payloads or malicious scripts on the target system. The obfuscation and embedded encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent.",
