{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup with custom installation behavior, including a potentially malicious remote code execution step during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables for version, description, and long description. It imports os, requests, and Fernet (from cryptography), and executes a decrypted payload during installation if on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() with data obtained from Fernet decryption, which can run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it directly via exec(), leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; the variable and function names are obfuscated or nonsensical; the setup script includes a suspicious runtime behavior that executes code fetched from a hardcoded encrypted string.",
  "analysis": "The setup script contains a custom install command that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload via exec(). The payload is encrypted with a Fernet key embedded in the code. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code during package installation. The code's variable names are obfuscated, and the overall structure hints at malicious intent or sabotage. The use of Fernet encryption indicates an attempt to hide the malicious payload. Since the code executes code fetched from a hardcoded encrypted string upon installation, it poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, which constitutes a supply chain security threat. It appears to be a malicious package designed to run arbitrary code on victim systems during setup.",
