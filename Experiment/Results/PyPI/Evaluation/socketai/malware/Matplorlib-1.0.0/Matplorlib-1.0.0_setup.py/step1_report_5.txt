{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including decrypting and executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment (os.name), hardcoded encrypted strings, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, which could be used for malicious network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers import of 'requests' and 'fernet', then executes decrypted code via exec(), which could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; obfuscated package name 'Matplorlib'; suspiciously long description strings; custom install command running exec() with decrypted code; setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used in malicious contexts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package named 'Matplorlib'. The custom install class 'gYXfbVmGfEXTNpEIpqnOgjpIPvjYIyOuFumfkICumMyJyfCTGgZpGFQUqtqPIykfQimjtuROSfYqCGFqPZlIajqwkeYgmqjMrYVclkWdEYEerZnNtgknFebJOtxQiGUeqXiglgUSKAsLcaLTzhRGRIWHNeikDATnRdCStxdLNzDiruWFLjnEPdyEOigLqnJPHy' overrides the run method. This method decrypts and executes code via exec(), which is a high-risk behavior. The code uses encrypted strings that, when decrypted, likely execute arbitrary code. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules further suggests potential for malicious network activity. The package metadata appears intentionally obfuscated or nonsensical, further raising suspicion. Overall, the code appears designed to execute malicious code during package installation, likely to compromise systems or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing code during installation via exec(), which could allow remote code execution or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and custom install routines strongly indicates malicious intent. The package should not be used.",
