      "conclusion": "The code exhibits explicit malicious intent by decrypting and executing code during package installation on Windows, representing a severe security threat. The high obfuscation and encrypted payloads reinforce this assessment. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior. This package should be considered malicious and avoided."
