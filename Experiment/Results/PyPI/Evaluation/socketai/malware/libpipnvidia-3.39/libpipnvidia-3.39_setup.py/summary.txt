  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, triggered by filesystem state, with embedded suspicious URLs. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics or malware delivery mechanisms. The high malware and risk scores are justified; the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis is performed."
