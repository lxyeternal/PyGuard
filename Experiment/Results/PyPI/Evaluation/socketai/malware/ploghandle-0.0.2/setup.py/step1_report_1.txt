  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'polaris' Python package, primarily to read version info and configure package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '__init__.py' file, executing an external script to get version, and fetching system info via platform and subprocess calls. Also, performing an HTTP GET request to an external IP address.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to 'http://1.15.77.2/v/%s', which involves network transmission of potentially sensitive or system-related data encoded in base64.",
  "flows": "Read version info from local file -> execute external version script -> collect system info -> encode and send system info via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing an external script to retrieve version info, collecting extensive system info (hostname, uname, current directory, network config) and sending this info to an external IP address without any clear purpose or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks such as reading a version string from a file and configuring package metadata. However, it also runs an external script via subprocess.Popen, which could be malicious if the script is compromised or malicious itself. More concerning is the collection of system information, which is then encoded in base64 and sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or system fingerprinting without user awareness. The purpose of sending this data is unclear, and there are no comments or safeguards to prevent misuse. These actions are abnormal for a typical setup script and indicate potential malicious intent or at least unsafe data collection practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting detailed system info and sending it to an external IP address without transparency or user consent. The execution of an external script to determine version further adds to concerns about malicious activity. Overall, the code poses a security risk due to data exfiltration and abnormal system access, suggesting it may be malicious or at least unsafe.",
