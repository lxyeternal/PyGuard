  "purpose": "Analysis of macOS extended attributes and filesystem metadata to determine malicious intent or security risks.",
  "sources": "Filesystem metadata attributes such as com.apple.quarantine, com.apple.lastuseddate#PS, and binary blobs in resource forks.",
  "sinks": "None; data is static metadata, not processed or executed code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data remains within filesystem attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encoded or binary data in metadata, but this is typical for filesystem attributes and not malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static macOS extended attributes and resource fork data, including quarantine flags and metadata tags. No executable code, scripts, or network activity are present. The data is consistent with standard filesystem metadata, and no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or obfuscation are observed. The reports correctly interpret this as benign metadata. Scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0-0.2) are appropriate given the static nature of the data. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor obfuscation scores reflect encoded data typical of filesystem attributes, not malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed data is benign macOS filesystem metadata with no malicious or security-threatening content. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the data's nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
