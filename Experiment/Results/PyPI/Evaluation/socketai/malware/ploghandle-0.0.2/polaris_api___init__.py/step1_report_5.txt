{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming requests, potentially serving some web content or API.",
  "sources": "User inputs via HTTP requests, environment variables (if any are used), and possibly external data sources if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Response outputs to HTTP clients, possibly data stored or sent over network sockets, or logs.",
  "flows": "Input received from network requests is processed and then sent back as responses; any external data sources are integrated into this flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious obfuscation, or suspicious library usage detected. No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors are evident. However, code structure appears minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an HTTP server, processes incoming requests, and returns responses. It uses standard library modules such as 'http.server' and 'socketserver' without apparent malicious extensions. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are observed. The code does not demonstrate unsafe practices like unsanitized input handling or insecure data storage. It appears to be a benign web server implementation, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors evident from the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems to implement a standard, harmless HTTP server. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
