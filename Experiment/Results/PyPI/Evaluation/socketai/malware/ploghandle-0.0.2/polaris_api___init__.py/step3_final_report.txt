{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python script setting up a simple web server using standard libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads data from network sockets via 'http.server' and 'socketserver' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; standard server setup with no malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input from network requests handled by server modules; no malicious or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries to instantiate a web server, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. No external dependencies or network connections to suspicious domains are present. The structure is clear, and no unusual code constructs are used. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence in benignity is high, and no obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
