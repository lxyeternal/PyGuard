  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility for performing mathematical calculations, possibly related to statistics or data analysis.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()' or external data sources are not explicitly visible; data might be hardcoded or passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs to internal calculations is straightforward; no untrusted data processing pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code executes standard mathematical operations without external data dependencies or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or suspicious external communication. The structure is clear and consistent with typical utility scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code functions as a typical mathematical utility with no malicious or suspicious components.",
