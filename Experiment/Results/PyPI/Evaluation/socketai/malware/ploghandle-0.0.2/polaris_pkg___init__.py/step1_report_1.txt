  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs some basic operations, potentially including input handling and data processing.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()' or reading from files, environment variables, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous functions such as 'exec()', 'eval()', 'os.system()', or writing sensitive data to files or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input or environment variables) to sinks (e.g., eval, system calls) through variables and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. No unusual code patterns or malicious behavior detected in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic. It does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation functions. Usage of functions like 'exec' or 'eval' is not present. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors observed. The structure indicates basic data handling, without any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be benign and standard in function. No malware, obfuscation, or security threats are evident.",
