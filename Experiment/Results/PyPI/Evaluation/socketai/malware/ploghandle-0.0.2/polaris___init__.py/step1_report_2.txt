{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import all functions, classes, or variables from a module named 'api' within the same package and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .api import *' reads from the local 'api' module, and the assignment '__version__' reads a string constant.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the import statement if 'api' is malicious or compromised, but given it's a local module, this is less suspicious. The version string is a benign assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the import and version assignment are static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can be considered poor practice as it can obscure what is imported, but by itself, it is not malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all from a local module, which can hide malicious imports but is not inherently malicious. The version string is a common practice for package versioning. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It is a minimal package setup snippet with no suspicious activity detected.",
