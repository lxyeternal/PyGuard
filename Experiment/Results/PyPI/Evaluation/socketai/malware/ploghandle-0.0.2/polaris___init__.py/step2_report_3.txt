  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet:\n  ```python\n  from .api import *\n  __version__ = '0.0.2'\n  ```\n- The code is minimal, importing everything from a local module and defining a version string.\n- No runtime behavior, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'api' module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code imports from `.api` and sets a version string.\n- **Malicious code in snippet:** None of the reports show evidence of malicious code in this fragment. The code itself is benign.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- **Use of `import *`:** All reports note that `import *` is bad practice but not inherently malicious. This is accurate.\n- **Potential risks:** The main concern is whether the `api` module could contain malicious code. Since it's a local module, unless the module is compromised, the risk is minimal.\n- **Logical consistency:** All reports are consistent with each other regarding the benign nature of this snippet.\n\n### Score Evaluations\n\n- **Confidence scores:** Ranging from 0.6 to 1.0, generally high, reflecting confidence that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, which is appropriate given the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.1 to 0.2, which seem reasonable given the potential risk of importing from a module that could be malicious.\n\n### Justification for Malware and Risk Scores\n\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score can be slightly elevated due to the use of `import *`, which could hide malicious code if the `api` module is compromised. However, given the code snippet alone, this is a low concern.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions and Claims\n\n- No report claims actual malicious activity; they only mention potential risks.\n- The assumption that the `api` module could be malicious is valid but speculative without further context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is benign.** The main concern is the potential risk introduced by `import *`, but this is a known best-practice issue rather than a security threat per se.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0                 | No malicious code detected in snippet.                     |\n| obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.          |\n| security risk   | 0.1               | Slight concern due to `import *`, but overall low risk. |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed; code imports from `.api` and sets a version.\n- **Malicious code:** Not present.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Risk:** Very low; mainly the use of `import *` which can be risky if the imported module is malicious.\n\n**Final note:** If further context shows that the `.api` module is compromised or contains malicious code, the malware score would need to be updated accordingly. But based solely on this snippet, the risk remains minimal.",
