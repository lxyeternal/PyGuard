  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of all from a local 'api' module and a version string.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or runtime behavior; static import.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' can hide malicious code if 'api' is compromised, but the snippet itself is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code is low risk, but the main concern is the content of 'api'. The confidence score (0.6) seems reasonable, and malware score (0) is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting low risk but acknowledging potential concern.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources; static.\n- **Anomalies:** 'import *' is poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is high (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.1—reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as previous; static import.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' can be risky but is not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, malware 0, risk 0.2—acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scoring reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import is bad practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes benign nature; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.1—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static import, no external data.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' noted as risky but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is typical boilerplate with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1—reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores align.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code itself** is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Main concern** across reports is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the 'api' module is compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n- **Malware scores** are all zero, which is appropriate given the code snippets.\n- **Risk scores** are low, reflecting the minimal inherent risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, since no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for the imported module to be malicious, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) could be justified, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the risk of malicious content in 'api', but not in this snippet)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with the main concern being the trustworthiness of the 'api' module. The current scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary based on the provided information.",
