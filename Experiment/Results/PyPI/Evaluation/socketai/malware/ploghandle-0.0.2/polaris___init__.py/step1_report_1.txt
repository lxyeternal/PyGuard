  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and defines a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the imported module contains malicious code, it could be executed. The version string is benign.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module into the current namespace; no direct untrusted input handling in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what code is being imported, possibly hiding malicious code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'api', which could contain malicious code, but this snippet alone does not include any malicious behavior. The version string is standard and harmless. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears benign and straightforward, but since the imported module is not shown, there's a potential risk if that module contains malicious code. Overall, this code alone is low risk.",
