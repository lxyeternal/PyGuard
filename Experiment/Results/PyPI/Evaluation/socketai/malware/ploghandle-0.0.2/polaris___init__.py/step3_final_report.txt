  "purpose": "Minimal package setup code importing all symbols from a local 'api' module and defining a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if 'api' is compromised",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing everything from a local module and setting a version. No runtime behavior, network activity, or data handling is present. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is a style issue rather than a security threat. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the risk score is low, reflecting the minimal inherent risk. The confidence in benignity is high, but the potential risk depends on the contents of 'api', which cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which could hide malicious code if the 'api' module is compromised. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2). No changes are necessary unless further context indicates 'api' is malicious.",
