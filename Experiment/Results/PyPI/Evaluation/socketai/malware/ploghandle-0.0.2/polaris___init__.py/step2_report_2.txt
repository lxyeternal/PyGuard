  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .api import *\n\n__version__ = '0.0.2'\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a wildcard import from a local module `.api`.\n- It defines a version string.\n- No other logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import and version string.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential risk if `api` contains malicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the use of `import *` can hide malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Concludes low risk, but potential risk depends on `api`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.6.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. Since the code only imports from a local module, the risk hinges entirely on the content of `api`. The low malware score is justified, and the risk score is appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar identification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes the local nature reduces suspicion.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses `import *`, which is poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The low malware score aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The confidence is high, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential if `api` is malicious but finds no direct malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes `import *` can be risky but not inherently malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score is conservative, which is suitable given the potential for `api` to be malicious, though not evidenced here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses `import *`, considered poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Same concern about `import *`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign `0`, as there's no evidence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All `0`, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly low, reflecting the potential risk if `api` contains malicious code.\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the fact that the risk depends entirely on the contents of the local `api` module (which is unknown here), I would:\n\n- Keep the malware score at **0** across all reports.\n- Maintain obfuscated at **0**.\n- Set the **security risk score** at **0.1** to **0.2**, reflecting the concern about `import *` and the potential for malicious content in `api`, but recognizing that the snippet itself is benign.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| All     | 0       | 0            | 0.1 - 0.2 |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe main concern is the imported module's content, which cannot be assessed here. The code snippet itself is not malicious, but the use of `import *` warrants cautious scoring.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The risk scores are appropriately conservative.\n- No changes needed unless further context about `api` is provided.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2",
