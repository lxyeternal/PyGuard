  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local 'api' module and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'api' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or data leak points present",
  "flows": "Import statement pulls in code from 'api' module; version assignment is static",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .api import *' can be risky as it imports all symbols without explicit control, but this is a common pattern in packages; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named 'api', which could potentially introduce namespace pollution but does not inherently contain malicious behavior. The version string is statically assigned. There are no evident code injections, network calls, credential handling, or other malicious activities. The simplicity suggests typical package setup code without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package boilerplate for importing API components and setting a version. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on this code snippet.",
