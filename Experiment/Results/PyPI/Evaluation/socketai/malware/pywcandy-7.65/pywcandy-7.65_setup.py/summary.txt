  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The package contains an obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during setup, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent. The obfuscation, execution context, and error suppression suggest potential for remote code execution or data theft. Scores are justified and should be set at malware 0.8, obfuscation 0.9, and security risk 0.8. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended for confirmation."
