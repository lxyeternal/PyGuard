      "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious indicators—obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, with suspicious URL. The setup script is likely exploited as a vector for malicious payloads. The high scores reflect significant suspicion of malicious activity. Decoding the PowerShell command could confirm payload intent, but current evidence warrants high alert and treatment of this package as malicious."
