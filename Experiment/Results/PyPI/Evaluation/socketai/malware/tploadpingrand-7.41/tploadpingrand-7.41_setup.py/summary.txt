  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious behavior due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload triggered by a filesystem check, with broad silent exception handling and a suspicious URL comment. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence."
