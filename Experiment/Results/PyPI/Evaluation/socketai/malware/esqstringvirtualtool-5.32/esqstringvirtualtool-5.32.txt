      "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior evidenced by the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, with high obfuscation and stealth characteristics. The scores assigned are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security threat. It should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
