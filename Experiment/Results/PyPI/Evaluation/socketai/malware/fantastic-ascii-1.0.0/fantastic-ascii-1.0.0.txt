      "conclusion": "The script exhibits clear malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The external communication to suspicious domains and writing of proof files are indicative of a backdoor or spyware component. The high scores in the reports are justified; the code should be considered malicious and avoided."
