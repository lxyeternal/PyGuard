{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with custom post-install behavior that collects system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org') and reading from the filesystem ('README.md', 'pocbykotko.txt') and environment ('__file__', 'os.uname()').",
  "sinks": "Requests.get() calls that send system info (IP, hostname, path) encoded in base64 to external domains.",
  "flows": "The post-install function collects system data, encodes it, and sends it via GET requests to external servers. Data flows from system/environment sources to network sinks through these requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a post-install hook that gathers system IP, hostname, and file path information and transmits it to an external domain without user consent or obvious necessity. The presence of commented-out code is benign but indicates potential for further modifications. No input validation or security checks are present for the external requests. The file writes a proof message into 'pocbykotko.txt' each install, which appears benign but could be a marker or test artifact.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard and third-party modules, including 'requests' for network communication. A custom 'install' class registers a post-install function that executes upon package installation. This function writes a proof message to a local file and gathers system information—public IP, hostname, and install path—and encodes this data in base64. It then sends this data via GET requests to external URLs, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious data collection. No malicious system modifications or backdoors are detected. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions beyond data exfiltration, but the intent to collect and transmit system data silently raises privacy concerns. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are present, but the external communication pattern is suspicious in the context of supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a setup configuration with a hidden post-install step that silently collects and transmits system information to external servers. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It does not involve malware like system damage or reverse shells but exhibits privacy-invasive behavior that warrants caution. The overall security risk score is moderate due to privacy concerns but no direct system harm.",
