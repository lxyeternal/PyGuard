{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to package and distribute a Python project, including custom installation behavior that interacts with external services.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network (requests.get to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'), reads the README file for description, and accesses system information (os.uname), as well as reading and writing local files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests that send data to 'https://kotko.org' with base64-encoded IP, hostname, and path; writing to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'; reading system info; reading the README file.",
  "flows": "During installation (via the custom 'new_install' class), the code executes '_post_install', which collects system info and network data, encodes and sends it over the network, and writes a proof file locally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network communications during installation, including sending base64-encoded system information to an external domain. It also writes a proof file ('pocbykotko.txt') with a hardcoded message. The URL 'kotko.org' appears suspicious. The custom install class and registered post-install function suggest unusual behavior not typical for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with typical setup configuration but includes a custom install class that registers a post-install hook '_post_install'. This function performs multiple actions: it writes a file locally ('pocbykotko.txt'), retrieves the public IP address, gathers hostname and current path information, encodes these details in base64, and then sends this data via a GET request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded data as URL parameters. These behaviors are unusual for a normal setup script, indicating potential malicious intent such as exfiltrating system information without user consent. The network communication and file writing occur during installation, which can be considered malicious activity. No other code indicates obfuscation or hidden backdoors; however, the act of transmitting system data to an external domain during installation is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of data exfiltration during package installation, including sending system information to an external domain and writing a proof file locally. These actions are atypical for standard setup scripts and indicate potentially malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated with suspicion.",
