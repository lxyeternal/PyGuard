{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and installation behavior using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Requests library for HTTP GET requests, reading README.md for long description, reading file system for paths, and network communication via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with sensitive data encoded in base64, writing to a local file, and reading system information such as IP address, hostname, and file paths.",
  "flows": "During installation, _post_install() is called which retrieves external IP, encodes system info, and transmits it via HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain; also writes to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install() function performs unsolicited network requests, sends system data encoded in base64 to an external domain, and writes a file with seemingly arbitrary content. The code registers _post_install() to run at exit, potentially executing after install. The use of requests to send system info to external servers without user consent is suspicious. The commented-out function is unused but indicates previous or potential malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a package setup script with additional behavior defined in _post_install(). This function collects system information, encodes it, and exfiltrates it via a GET request to an external domain. This network activity, especially during or after installation, is suspicious. The code writes a text file with arbitrary content, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the data exfiltration behavior is highly suspicious. The registration of _post_install() via atexit.register is unusual and could be used to execute malicious code upon exit, but in this context, it is likely intended for post-install actions. Overall, the code appears to perform data collection and exfiltration without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with embedded malicious behavior involving system information theft and exfiltration. The network requests to external domains with encoded system data represent a security concern. Although no clear backdoor or malicious payload is present beyond data exfiltration, the actions are suspicious and potentially malicious. It should be considered high risk and not trusted for installation.",
