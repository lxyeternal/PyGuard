{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs the package, manages post-install actions, and collects metadata for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, requests data from 'https://api.ipify.org', and makes a GET request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (api.ipify.org and kotko.org), file writing ('pocbykotko.txt'), and base64 encoding of sensitive info.",
  "flows": "The script retrieves system IP and hostname, encodes them, and transmits this data to external servers. It also writes to a local file during post-install.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests to external servers during installation and post-install. It encodes system info and sends it without user consent. The file 'pocbykotko.txt' is created and appended to, possibly indicating a proof-of-concept or backdoor setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, upon installation, executes _post_install(), which writes to a local file and transmits system info (IP, hostname, path) encoded in base64 to an external domain. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking without explicit user consent. The external URL 'kotko.org' could be suspicious if not verified, and the code's intent to collect and send system information indicates malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The use of requests during install and the encoding step point towards potentially malicious intent, especially if the package is distributed broadly. No obfuscated code or complex obfuscation techniques are used; the code is straightforward but performs hidden data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: it collects system information during installation and sends it to a remote server without user awareness or consent. The code also writes to a local file, possibly as proof or for backdoor purposes. These actions suggest malicious intent and privacy violations.",
