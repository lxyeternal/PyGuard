  "purpose": "The code collects system information (IP address, hostname, installation path), encodes it in base64, and transmits it to an external server during package installation. It also writes a proof message to a local file.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for IP, 'https://kotko.org' for data exfiltration, and reading the installation directory path.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sending encoded system info to external domains, writing to 'pocbykotko.txt' file.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') and other system info; Sink: requests.get to 'kotko.org' with encoded data, file write operation.",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during setup, external communication with suspicious domains, registration of post-install function via atexit, no input validation or user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data collection by retrieving external IP, hostname, and installation path, then encodes and transmits this information to an external server during package installation. It writes a proof message to a local file. The use of atexit to register the post-install function is unconventional, possibly to delay or hide activity. The network requests to 'kotko.org' and 'api.ipify.org' are suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is malicious. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the active exfiltration of sensitive data, a malware score close to 1 and a high security risk score are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits clear malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation. The external communication to suspicious domains and writing of proof files are indicative of a backdoor or spyware component. The high scores in the reports are justified; the code should be considered malicious and avoided.",
