Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, supported by suspicious code patterns, while the remaining reports correctly identify benign or incomplete code with low risk. No adjustments are necessary unless actual code confirms or refutes the described anomalies."

The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Dynamic execution and environment variable reliance warrant minimal caution but do not currently indicate malicious intent."
