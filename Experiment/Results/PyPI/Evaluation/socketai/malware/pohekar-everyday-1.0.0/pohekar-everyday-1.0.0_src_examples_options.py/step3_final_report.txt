  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security risks in the open source Python dependency based on provided code reviews and reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, suspicious patterns (obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded addresses), network activity, code structure, and anomalies.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, system calls, data flows from untrusted sources, environment variables, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parsing or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or system commands, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution (`eval`, `exec`), hardcoded IPs/URLs, suspicious data flows, minimal or absent code, inconsistent or overly generic analysis justifications.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align their scores with described suspicious patterns, with Report 1 indicating high malicious potential justified by obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity. Other reports correctly identify benign or incomplete code, assigning low scores. Scores such as malware (0.75) for Report 1 and zero for others are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available information. No significant inconsistencies or false positives are evident. The overall assessment confirms that Report 1's suspicion is justified if the described patterns are present, while others are benign or inconclusive.",
  "conclusion": "The security assessments and scores are consistent and justified based on the reports. Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, supported by suspicious code patterns, while the remaining reports correctly identify benign or incomplete code with low risk. No adjustments are necessary unless actual code confirms or refutes the described anomalies.",
