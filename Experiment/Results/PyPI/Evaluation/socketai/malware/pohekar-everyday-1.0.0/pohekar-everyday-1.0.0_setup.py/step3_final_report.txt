  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system during package installation or development, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "The base64 string 'CODE_REPLACE' decoded in notmalfunc(), invoked during install or develop phases.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded code, which could run arbitrary commands or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes 'CODE_REPLACE' -> os.system() executes the decoded string during setup phases.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and os.system() during package setup, placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' indicating potential malicious payload insertion.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a function that decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system during installation or development. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests an intent to insert malicious payloads. The pattern of obfuscation and dynamic execution is typical of malicious supply chain components. The code's structure is suspicious, and executing arbitrary code during setup poses significant security risks. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the pattern, even though the actual payload is absent. The code should be treated as malicious until verified otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates high potential for malicious activity due to obfuscation and runtime code execution during package installation. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests malicious payloads could be inserted, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
