{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to package and install a Python project, with custom behaviors during installation and development phases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which decodes and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded string from the base64 data is executed as a system command using os.system, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string from b64d() is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), executing potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed dynamically at install time is suspicious. The actual command is hidden within the base64 string labeled 'CODE_REPLACE', indicating intent to conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and custom installation behaviors. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. During the install phase, notmalfunc() is invoked, which means any code contained in the base64 string is executed during package installation. The base64 string is obfuscated, and its content is hidden as 'CODE_REPLACE', indicating a deliberate attempt to conceal malicious commands. The code does not contain any other suspicious behaviors or hardcoded secrets outside of this obfuscated execution. The approach is typical of malicious supply chain attacks aiming to run arbitrary code during package installation. The rest of the script appears normal, and third-party library usage is standard. The key concern is the dynamic execution of external code hidden behind base64 encoding during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent by executing hidden code during package installation, likely intended to run arbitrary or malicious commands. The obfuscated base64 payload is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This package should be treated as malicious or compromised due to the hidden code execution mechanism.",
