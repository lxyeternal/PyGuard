{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation process for a Python package, with a hidden malicious payload execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'CODE_REPLACE' base64-encoded string inside the 'notmalfunc' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes the decoded code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded in 'notmalfunc', then passed to 'os.system' to execute, triggered during the 'install' process via 'AfterInstall'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 decoding to hide code, combined with execution via os.system, indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The actual code is concealed in 'CODE_REPLACE', suggesting intent to hide malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package but includes a function 'notmalfunc' that decodes and executes code from a base64 string. This function is called during the 'install' command via the 'AfterInstall' class. The base64 string is a placeholder ('CODE_REPLACE'), which indicates that malicious code could be embedded here, hidden from plain sight. The decoding and execution pattern is suspicious, as it attempts to obfuscate potentially malicious payload. The use of 'os.system' for executing decoded code is risky, as it allows arbitrary command execution. Overall, the script aims to execute hidden code during package installation, which is a typical tactic in malicious packages to run payloads on victim systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and malicious potential by decoding and executing hidden code during package installation. The pattern suggests an intent to run arbitrary code concealed within the base64 string, representing a high security risk.",
