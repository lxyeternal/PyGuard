{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'pohekar-everyday', with custom install and develop commands that execute additional code after installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a base64-encoded string in the function b64d, and potentially from environment variables or external inputs if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "The code executes system commands via os.system(b64d(...)), which could run arbitrary code decoded from the base64 string.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by b64d and then executed via os.system in the notmalfunc() function during the 'install' command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to hide execution of code, and execution of decoded code via os.system, which is a common pattern for obfuscation or malicious code execution. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests dynamic code injection or manipulation. No actual code is provided, indicating possible intent to hide malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines functions that decode base64-encoded code and execute it via os.system, triggered during the installation process. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to conceal malicious code. The code does not specify the content of the base64-encoded string ('CODE_REPLACE'), which is critical to determine actual malicious behavior. The rest of the script is standard for a Python package setup, with custom install and develop commands that run additional code post-installation. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates an intent to insert malicious commands, such as executing malicious scripts, downloading payloads, or executing arbitrary code, which poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation techniques (base64 decoding and dynamic execution) and executes external code during installation, which is highly suspicious. The placeholder indicates that malicious payloads could be inserted, making this package potentially dangerous. Without the actual content of the base64 string, the exact nature of malicious activity cannot be confirmed, but the structure is consistent with malicious behavior.",
