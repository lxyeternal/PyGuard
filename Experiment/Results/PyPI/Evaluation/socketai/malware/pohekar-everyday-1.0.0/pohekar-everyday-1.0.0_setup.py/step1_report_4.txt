{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup with custom install and develop commands that execute potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a base64-encoded string within the notmalfunc() function, which is called during the install process (AfterInstall.run).",
  "sinks": "The decoded code from the base64 string is executed via os.system, which can run arbitrary commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls AfterInstall.run(), which calls notmalfunc(), decoding the base64 string and executing it via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to hide code execution, execution of decoded code via os.system, and the placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' indicating dynamic or malicious content. No actual code is provided in the placeholder, but the structure suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines custom commands for installation and development. The key function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string and executes it with os.system. During the installation process, notmalfunc() is invoked, potentially executing malicious code embedded in the base64 string. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests that malicious code could be injected or dynamically inserted, enabling arbitrary system commands or malicious actions. The use of base64 obfuscation and execution via os.system is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. The overall structure and flow strongly indicate malicious intent, especially since code execution is triggered during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and appears designed to execute arbitrary code during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The use of obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques suggest malicious intent.",
