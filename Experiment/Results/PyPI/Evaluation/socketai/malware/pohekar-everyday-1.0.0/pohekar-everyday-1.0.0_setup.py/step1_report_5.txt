  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script with custom installation and development commands that execute potentially malicious code.",
  "sources": "b64d function decoding base64 string; notmalfunc function executing os.system with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which can run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "b64d decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc executes os.system with decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to conceal code execution; dynamic execution via os.system; code replaced with placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' which could be malicious; custom install/develop commands executing code after installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools modules, defines a decoding function for base64-encoded code, and a function that executes system commands based on decoded content. The custom install and develop classes run this function post-installation or development. The setup configuration specifies package details. The presence of base64 decoding and runtime execution via os.system suggests obfuscation or concealment of malicious code. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates potential malicious payloads that could execute arbitrary commands. The execution occurs during install or develop phases, which could compromise systems installing this package. Overall, the code employs obfuscation and runtime code execution, which are suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation techniques, decodes and executes system commands dynamically, and executes code during package installation, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent or behavior. It warrants suspicion and further review before use.",
