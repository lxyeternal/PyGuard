  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or computation, but without the actual code provided, the specific purpose cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or files (if present). Since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or environment variable modifications, but none are explicitly shown due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls or data assignments. Specific flow paths cannot be identified without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs can be detected without the actual code snippet.",
  "analysis": "No code was provided for review, so a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Based on typical patterns, standard code would not be suspicious unless specific risky constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for analysis; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The overall assessment remains inconclusive due to missing code details.",
