  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package installation, silent error handling, and concealment tactics. It should be treated as potentially malicious until payload decoding and further analysis confirm benign intent."
