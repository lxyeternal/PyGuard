  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input handling, environment variables, network connections, file operations, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable access, data output, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks, such as user input or environment variables flowing into network requests or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is absent; all reports correctly identify this and assign low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The risk scores are conservative, reflecting potential input sanitization issues without concrete evidence. The confidence levels are appropriate given the lack of code. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are observed or inferred. The reasoning across reports is consistent, cautious, and justified, with no false positives or overlooked signals.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the assessments are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or details are provided.",
