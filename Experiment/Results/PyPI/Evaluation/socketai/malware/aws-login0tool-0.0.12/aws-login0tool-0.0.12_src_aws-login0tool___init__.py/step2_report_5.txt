  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report states that the code appears standard, with no overt malicious behavior, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity observed.\n- The confidence is 0.7, malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the reasoning. Since no specific code is provided, the analysis is based on the description. The low malware and risk scores seem appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- The report notes insufficient code details but finds no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.\n- Confidence is 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Given the lack of code, the cautious approach is reasonable. No evidence of issues is found.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, no code provided but the analysis suggests benign behavior.\n- Confidence 0.7, malware 0, risk 0.3.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score (0.3) may be a bit optimistic given the lack of code, but since the reasoning is cautious, it seems acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- No code provided; analysis confirms inability to assess.\n- Scores all zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- No code; no analysis possible.\n- Scores all zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly recognize the absence of code, and their scores reflect that.\n- The first three reports, which include some analysis, have reasonable confidence and scores.\n- The last two reports correctly abstain from assigning any risk or malware scores due to lack of code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Based on the descriptions, no report's scoring appears unreasonable.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with no code provided.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the cautious stance.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- Given the absence of code, I would assign:\n  - Malware score: **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n  - Obfuscated score: **0** (no indication of obfuscation)\n  - Risk score: **0.1** (generally low, unless context suggests otherwise)\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and reasonable. No further adjustments are necessary.",
