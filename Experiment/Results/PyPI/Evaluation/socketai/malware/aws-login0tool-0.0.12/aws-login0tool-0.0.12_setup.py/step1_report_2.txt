{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior to download and execute a potentially harmful executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe' is used as a source to download an executable file during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file 'syswin32.exe' is executed immediately using the 'start' command, which could run malicious code on the target system.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method in the 'SneakyInstall' class retrieves the executable from the URL (source) and then executes it via 'start' (sink), forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes overriding the 'install' command to automatically download and execute a file from an external URL without user consent. The URL appears suspicious and is not related to the package's described purpose. The code uses 'try-except' to suppress errors, which can hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'SneakyInstall' that, during installation, downloads an executable from an external URL and immediately executes it. This behavior is embedded within the 'run' method, which is called during the setup process. The code does not validate the downloaded file, nor does it notify the user, indicating malicious intent. The URL used is suspicious and does not relate to the package's described functionality. The overall structure leverages standard setup tools but maliciously injects code to run external payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. This is a supply chain attack vector intended to run arbitrary code on victim systems. The package should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
