{
  "purpose": "The setup script is designed to install a Python package named 'aws-login0tool' with some metadata and package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code retrieves a file from an external URL using urllib.request.urlretrieve and executes it with the run(['start', 'syswin32.exe'], shell=True) command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The external file 'syswin32.exe' is downloaded and executed on the user's system, potentially causing malicious activity such as malware infection or unauthorized system access.",
  "flows": "The code flow retrieves the executable from the internet (source) and then runs it directly on the host system (sink) during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The run method in the custom install class executes an external executable from a remote URL without validation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The use of shell=True with 'start' indicates an attempt to execute or open the downloaded file silently.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class 'SneakyInstall' that overrides the run method. During package installation, it downloads a potentially malicious executable from 'https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe' and attempts to execute it using 'start' via subprocess. This behavior is malicious because it involves executing untrusted code remotely, which can harm the user's system, steal data, or establish backdoors. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no other suspicious activities. The malicious part is clearly embedded in the overridden run method, which is invoked during the install process, making it a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that downloads and executes a remote executable during installation, indicating high malicious intent. This is a supply chain attack vector embedded within a seemingly legitimate setup script.",
