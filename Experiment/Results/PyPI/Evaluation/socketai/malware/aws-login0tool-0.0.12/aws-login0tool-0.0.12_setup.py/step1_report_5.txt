{
  "purpose": "The setup script is intended to install a Python package named 'aws-login0tool' with associated metadata.",
  "sources": "The code retrieves a file from an external URL using urllib.request.urlretrieve.",
  "sinks": "It executes the downloaded file 'syswin32.exe' using run(['start', 'syswin32.exe'], shell=True), which can execute arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads 'https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe' and then executes it, creating a direct source-to-sink flow that runs external, potentially malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "The class 'SneakyInstall' overrides the 'install' command to perform a download and execution of an external executable during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior. The use of 'start' with shell=True is also potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup modules and defines a custom install class that, during installation, downloads an external executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately. This behavior is atypical for a legitimate setup script and indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code during package installation. The package metadata appears benign and standard, but the installation process is malicious. The use of 'shell=True' and 'start' to execute the downloaded file further increases the risk of arbitrary code execution. Overall, the script exhibits malicious intent by embedding malware delivery in the package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable during installation, which could compromise the host system. The core intent appears to be malicious, with embedded malware delivery during package setup.",
