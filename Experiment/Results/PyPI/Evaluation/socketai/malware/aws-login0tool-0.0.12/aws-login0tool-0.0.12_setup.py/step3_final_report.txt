{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a malicious supply chain attack by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, potentially installing malware or backdoors without user consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe' via urllib.request.urlretrieve, which acts as the source of external data.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file 'syswin32.exe' is executed using run(['start', 'syswin32.exe'], shell=True), which is the sink where untrusted data leads to code execution.",
  "flows": "The source (URL download) flows directly into the sink (execution of the downloaded file) within the run() method of the SneakyInstall class during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code overrides the standard install command to include a download and execution step, downloads from an external suspicious URL, and executes without validation or user notification. Exception handling is minimal, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it via a shell command. This behavior is malicious, representing a supply chain attack vector. The URL is untrusted, and executing external code without validation poses severe security risks. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is explicit. The source-to-sink flow is direct, with no validation or safeguards, increasing the danger. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. The malicious activity justifies maximum scores, and the code should be flagged as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py contains malicious code that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, constituting a severe supply chain attack. The behavior is clearly malicious, and the scores reflect this accurately. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
