  "purpose": "A simple Python function that adds one to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward addition with no obfuscation, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with a single input and output. All reports correctly identify its benign and simple nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The function does not perform any external operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
