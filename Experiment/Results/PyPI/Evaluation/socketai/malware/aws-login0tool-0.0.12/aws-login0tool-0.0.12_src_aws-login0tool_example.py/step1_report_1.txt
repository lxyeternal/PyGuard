  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple arithmetic operation with no external dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'add_one' that takes a numeric input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious code or behavior. The logic is straightforward and safe. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic arithmetic function with no malicious intent or security risks.",
