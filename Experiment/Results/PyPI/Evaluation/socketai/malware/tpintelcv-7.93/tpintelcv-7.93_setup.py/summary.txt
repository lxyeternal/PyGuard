  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload during setup, triggered conditionally, with suspicious URLs and broad error suppression. It should be treated as malicious and avoided until further decoding and analysis confirm its intent."
