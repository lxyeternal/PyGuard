      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior: it installs a stealthy, obfuscated extension, modifies system shortcuts for persistence, and manipulates clipboard data. The activities are consistent with malware designed for data theft and system hijacking. The high scores assigned in previous reports (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified based on the evidence."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious behavior due to eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded endpoints. These patterns justify elevated malware and security risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a potentially malicious dependency that warrants further static or dynamic analysis before use."
