  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious behavior due to eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded endpoints. These patterns justify elevated malware and security risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a potentially malicious dependency that warrants further static or dynamic analysis before use."
