  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code reading input (user input, environment variables, files), import statements, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded endpoints, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file writes, dynamic code execution, data leaks, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network endpoints; obfuscated variables may mask malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with unverified input, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URLs/endpoints, absence of comments or documentation, minimal code structure that could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code in question exhibits patterns typical of obfuscated or malicious scripts, notably the use of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, and hardcoded network endpoints. These patterns suggest potential malicious intent, aligning with high malware (0.7) and obfuscation (0.8) scores, and a security risk of 0.75. The suspicion is justified given these indicators. Other code snippets, such as import statements or minimal code, show no signs of malicious activity, warranting low scores. The confidence in these assessments is high (0.9), based on the presence of suspicious patterns. The source-to-sink flow indicates that untrusted input could be executed or transmitted over the network, representing significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious behavior due to eval/exec usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded endpoints. These patterns justify elevated malware and security risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a potentially malicious dependency that warrants further static or dynamic analysis before use.",
