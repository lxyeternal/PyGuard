{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility for processing data, possibly involving network communication or data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external libraries (if used).",
  "sinks": "Data output to network connections, files, or system calls. Also, potentially, data passed into security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through processing functions, potentially reaching output points such as network or file system writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Some functions perform standard operations without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from function arguments or environment variables. It utilizes standard libraries for data handling. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or secret exfiltration routines, are evident. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or credential access that would indicate malicious intent. The overall structure and behavior seem benign, focusing on data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not contain any malware or supply chain attack vectors.",
