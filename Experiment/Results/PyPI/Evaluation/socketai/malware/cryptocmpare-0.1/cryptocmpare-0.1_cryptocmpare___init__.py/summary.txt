  "conclusion": "Overall, the code is predominantly benign with no confirmed malicious activity. The risk in Report 2 warrants a slight increase in malware likelihood due to insecure functions, but no actual malware is detected. Scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustment for Report 2's malware score enhances accuracy."
