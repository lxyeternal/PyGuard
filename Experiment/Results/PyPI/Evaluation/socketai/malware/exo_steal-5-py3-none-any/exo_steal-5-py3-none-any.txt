      "conclusion": "The code's import pattern and module name suggest malicious intent, likely related to data theft or exfiltration. The high suspicion warrants further inspection of 'exo-steal_file'. The current scores appropriately reflect the red flags, with high malware and risk scores justified by the naming conventions and import style."

      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet data, configuration files, and user screenshots without user consent. It employs hardcoded credentials and operates stealthily, masking errors and deleting evidence post-exfiltration. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with the obfuscation score at 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code."
