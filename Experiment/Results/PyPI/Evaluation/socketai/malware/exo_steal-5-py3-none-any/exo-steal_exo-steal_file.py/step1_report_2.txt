{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather sensitive user data, including wallet files, screenshots, and system information, then exfiltrates this data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), filesystem reads (wallet, config, seed, passphrase files), requests to external IP geolocation API, screenshot via pyautogui.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages, images, and documents, which send exfiltrated user data to an external chat ID.",
  "flows": "Data collected from filesystem and environment variables flows into ZIP archive and message string, which then flows into HTTP POST requests to Telegram API for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collecting multiple sensitive files, taking screenshots, and sending all this data over network without user consent. The code also constructs messages indicating data collection, and deletes the ZIP archive afterward.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by retrieving user information and environment paths, then checks for the existence of specific wallet and configuration files associated with Exodus wallet. If found, it captures a screenshot and packages these files into a ZIP archive. It gathers the user's IP and country code for geolocation, constructs a message including the data collected, and exfiltrates the ZIP, screenshot, and message via Telegram bot API endpoints. The hardcoded token and chat ID, combined with the collection of sensitive data and automatic exfiltration, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code operates stealthily, with no user prompts or transparency, and deletes the ZIP archive after sending. This behavior aligns with typical data-stealing malware targeting cryptocurrency wallets.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive user wallet data, system info, and screenshots to an external Telegram account. It operates stealthily with hardcoded credentials and automated data collection and transmission, constituting a clear security threat.",
