  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code exfiltrates wallet data, screenshots, and files, using environment variables, file checks, and system info requests.\n- **Sinks:** Accurately notes the use of Telegram API for sending messages, photos, and documents.\n- **Flows:** Correctly describes data flow from collection to exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded token, chat ID, and sensitive data collection without user consent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9), malware score (1), and security risk (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and consistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies collection of wallet files, screenshots, and system info.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly notes Telegram API endpoints for exfiltration.\n- **Flows:** Describes data flow accurately.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions hardcoded credentials and covert data collection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies the script as malicious, with a malware score of 1 and high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes collection of wallet files, screenshots, and IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly states data sent via Telegram.\n- **Flows:** Correctly describes data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded token, data collection without consent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies as malicious, with a malware score of 0.9 and high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes collection of wallet data, screenshots, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly states data sent via Telegram.\n- **Flows:** Accurate description.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded credentials, covert exfiltration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies malicious behavior, malware score 1, high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes collection of wallet files, config, seed, passphrase, screenshot, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly states data sent via Telegram.\n- **Flows:** Accurate description.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded credentials, sensitive data collection, no user consent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies as malicious, malware score 1, high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports agree on the malicious intent: collection of sensitive wallet data, screenshots, IP info, and exfiltration via Telegram with hardcoded credentials.\n- The malware scores are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), reflecting malicious behavior.\n- The security risk is also high (1 or 0.9).\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The core logic of the code is clearly malicious. It exfiltrates sensitive user data covertly.\n- The reports correctly identify the use of hardcoded credentials, data collection, and transmission.\n- The only point to consider is the malware score: while it's very high, a score of 1 is justified given the behavior. Slightly lower (e.g., 0.9) could be argued if some ambiguity existed, but the evidence strongly supports a maximum score.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 1 (consistent with the behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (the code is not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 1 (highly dangerous, data theft, exfiltration)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code operates silently, collecting private data without user consent.\n- The use of try-except blocks with empty except clauses masks errors, which is typical in malware to avoid crashing and detection.\n- The hardcoded token and chat ID are strong indicators of malicious control.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 1.0               | Clear data exfiltration, malicious intent, hardcoded credentials |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | No obfuscation detected                                    |\n| Security Risk     | 1.0               | High risk due to sensitive data theft and covert exfiltration |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and correctly classify the code as malicious malware with high security risk. The scores are justified as they stand, with the malware score at maximum due to the evident malicious behavior.",
