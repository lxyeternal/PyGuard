  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet data, configuration files, and user screenshots without user consent. It employs hardcoded credentials and operates stealthily, masking errors and deleting evidence post-exfiltration. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with the obfuscation score at 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code."
