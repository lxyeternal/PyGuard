{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user data related to the Exodus wallet, including configuration files, seed, passphrase, and wallet storage, then compresses these files, captures a screenshot, and sends all the collected data to a remote server via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User's environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP), filesystem (wallet-related files, configuration files, screenshots), network requests to external IP geolocation API, Telegram API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Telegram API for sending messages, images, and documents; file operations for reading wallet and config files; environment variables; filesystem deletion.",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads of wallet-related files and configuration data → compresses and zips files → captures screenshot → sends data via Telegram API endpoints → deletes zip file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of sensitive wallet data and credentials, uploading sensitive files and screenshots to external server, no user consent or obvious ethical purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by collecting user environment variables to locate wallet-related files and configuration data. It checks for the existence of specific directories and files associated with Exodus wallets. If such files are found, it takes a screenshot and compresses these files into a ZIP archive. The script then retrieves the user's IP address and country code, converts the country code into flag emojis, and constructs a message with this information. It proceeds to send the message, the screenshot, and the ZIP archive to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token and chat ID. Finally, it attempts to delete the ZIP file after transmission. The use of hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive files, and transmission to external servers without user consent strongly indicate malicious intent, likely designed for data theft or exfiltration of sensitive wallet data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in nature, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet information, configuration files, and screenshots to an external Telegram server. It operates stealthily, collecting user data and sending it externally without user consent, which qualifies it as a clear supply chain security threat.",
