{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather and zip sensitive user data related to the Exodus wallet and send it via Telegram, possibly for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment variables, specific wallet and configuration files, screenshots, and network responses for IP information.",
  "sinks": "It sends data to a Telegram bot via HTTP POST requests, including the zip archive, screenshots, and a message containing user info and location data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local file reads and environment variables into a zip archive, then to network endpoints via HTTP POST to Telegram API, with user info and files attached.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, the collection of sensitive wallet files, screenshots, and IP data without user consent, and the transmission of potentially private information to an external server. The code structure suggests a stealthy data collection operation.",
  "analysis": "The script collects environment variables, wallet configuration and data files, and screenshots, then compresses them into a zip archive. It also retrieves IP and location info from an external API. All this data is then sent to a Telegram bot, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. The hardcoded token and the nature of data collection without user knowledge strongly suggest malicious activity. The code lacks any user prompts or checks, reinforcing its covert purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to silently collect sensitive wallet and system data, capture a screenshot, and exfiltrate all information via Telegram. The hardcoded credentials, access to private files, and external data transmission confirm malicious behavior with high confidence. It should be considered highly dangerous.",
