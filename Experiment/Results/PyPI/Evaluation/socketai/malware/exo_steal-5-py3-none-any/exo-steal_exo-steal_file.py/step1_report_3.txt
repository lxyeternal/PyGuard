{
  "purpose": "The script collects sensitive user data, including wallet files, screenshots, and IP information, then exfiltrates it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, file existence checks, screenshot capture, network requests for IP info, and file reads for wallet data.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages, photos, and documents; file deletions; and network requests.",
  "flows": "Data from user environment variables and wallet files are collected, packaged into a ZIP file, and then sent over the network through Telegram API calls. IP and country code are fetched and embedded into a message, which is also sent.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of wallet files and sensitive data; screenshot capture of user desktop; exfiltration of all data through Telegram; multiple try-except blocks that suppress errors; use of requests to external IP API and Telegram API; no user consent or validation; potential for malware or data theft.",
  "analysis": "The code first gathers user-specific paths and environment variables, then checks for the existence of specific wallet and configuration files. If these files exist, it takes a screenshot and creates a ZIP archive containing the wallet data and config files. It also retrieves the user's public IP and country code, embedding a country flag in the message. The collected data, including the ZIP and screenshot, are sent via Telegram bot API endpoints, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data. The use of hardcoded credentials (Telegram token and chat ID), collection of sensitive files, and screenshot capture indicate malicious intent, aiming to steal wallet information and monitor the user. The code also deletes the ZIP file after transmission, attempting to conceal evidence. All these behaviors strongly suggest this is malicious malware designed for data theft and covert exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive user data, including wallet files and screenshots, using hardcoded credentials and covert network communications. It aims to steal user information and privacy, indicating a high security threat.",
