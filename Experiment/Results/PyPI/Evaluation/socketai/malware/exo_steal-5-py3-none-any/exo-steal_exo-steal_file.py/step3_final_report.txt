  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive wallet files, configuration, seed, passphrases, 2FA secrets, and user screenshots, then exfiltrates this data via Telegram API endpoints, indicating malicious intent to steal user wallet information covertly.",

  ],
  "analysis": "The script operates by checking for specific wallet-related files and directories, capturing a screenshot, and then packaging these files into a ZIP archive. It retrieves geolocation data via external API calls, constructs a detailed message including IP and country flag, and exfiltrates all data through Telegram's API endpoints for messages, photos, and documents. The use of hardcoded credentials, silent error handling, and immediate deletion of local files indicates malicious intent to covertly steal and transmit sensitive user data. The code's straightforward structure and lack of obfuscation confirm its malicious purpose. The behavior aligns with typical wallet-stealing malware, and the exfiltration via Telegram is characteristic of covert data theft tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet data, configuration files, and user screenshots without user consent. It employs hardcoded credentials and operates stealthily, masking errors and deleting evidence post-exfiltration. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0, with the obfuscation score at 0, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.",
