{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather sensitive user data, including wallet information, screenshots, and files from specific directories, and then exfiltrates this data via Telegram messages and file uploads.",
  "sources": "User input from environment variables (getenv), file existence checks, and system information requests (requests.get for IP and country info).",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages, photos, and documents, and file operations like creating zip archives and deleting files.",
  "flows": "The code collects sensitive files and screenshots, zips them, then sends the zip, screenshots, and info via Telegram, indicating data exfiltration flow from user system to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, chat ID, and sensitive file paths. The script collects wallet files, configuration, seed, passphrases, 2FA secrets, and user screenshots without user consent, and sends them externally. Excessive try-except blocks mask errors. It operates silently without user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses various sensitive user data files related to wallet information and configurations, captures a screenshot, zips all these files, and sends them via Telegram to a specific chat ID. It also retrieves IP and country information and includes flag emojis, which are then embedded into a message. The presence of hardcoded credentials, collection of private wallet data, and automated exfiltration indicate malicious intent. The code operates covertly, collecting and transmitting data without user awareness, which is characteristic of malware used for theft or spying. The use of try-except blocks with empty except clauses hides errors that could reveal the script’s operations. The code performs no legitimate user-centric function; its primary function is data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of data-stealing malware. It silently collects sensitive user files, screenshots, and system information, then exfiltrates them via Telegram. Hardcoded credentials and the nature of data targeted confirm its malicious intent. It should be classified as malware with high security risk.",
