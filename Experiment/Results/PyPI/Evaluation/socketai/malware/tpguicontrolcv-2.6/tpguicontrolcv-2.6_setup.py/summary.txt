  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with embedded suspicious URL. While the package setup code appears benign, the embedded payload poses a significant security threat. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the package should be flagged for further analysis or removal."
