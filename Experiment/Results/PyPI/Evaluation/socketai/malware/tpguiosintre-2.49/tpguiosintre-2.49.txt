      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload triggered during package setup, with suspicious comments and error suppression. These indicators strongly suggest malicious intent, making the package highly suspicious and potentially malicious. Further decoding of the payload is recommended, but current evidence warrants high security concern."
