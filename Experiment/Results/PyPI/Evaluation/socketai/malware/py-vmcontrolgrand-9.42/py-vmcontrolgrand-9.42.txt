      "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The use of concealment tactics and external URLs strongly suggests malicious activity. The assigned scores are justified, and the overall assessment indicates a high security threat requiring further investigation."
