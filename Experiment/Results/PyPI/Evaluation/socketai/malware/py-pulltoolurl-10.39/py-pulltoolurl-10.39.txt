      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, linked to an external malicious domain. Given the encoding, external connection, and silent execution, it is highly likely malicious. The package should be flagged for further analysis and potential removal from distribution channels."
