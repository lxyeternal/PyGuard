  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, which is indicative of malicious behavior or backdoor functionality. The high scores assigned by the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.8) are justified. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its purpose, but current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious or compromised."
