      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating a strong likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The silent error handling and obfuscation increase the risk profile. The package should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further analysis. The current scores (malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.8) are appropriate and should prompt thorough investigation or removal."
