{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'libpycccv' with an additional embedded behavior that attempts to execute a PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of the 'tahg' directory, importing subprocess and os modules, and reading environment variables (if any were present, though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which could be used to execute malicious code or download files.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory existence -> If absent, run embedded PowerShell command -> Proceed with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed without any user input or clear purpose, suspicious directory check ('tahg'), and running subprocess with hidden window. The setup code otherwise appears normal but is preceded by suspicious code intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core and then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks whether a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. The command is Base64-encoded, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts, but its decoded content is not directly visible here, making its purpose ambiguous. Following this, the code proceeds to call setup() to install a package named 'libpycccv'. The execution of the PowerShell command without validation or transparency, combined with the obfuscated payload, is suspicious. The rest of the code appears standard for a Python setup script but is overshadowed by this potentially malicious initial behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior due to the obfuscated PowerShell command executed without clear intent, potentially indicating malicious activity or a backdoor. The setup process itself seems normal but is preceded by this suspicious action. The overall risk is elevated due to the obfuscated command execution, and caution is advised before deploying or trusting this package.",
