      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious intent due to the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed conditionally. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment. The primary security concern is the potential for remote code execution or payload download. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious or highly suspicious and to decode and analyze the PowerShell payload further."
