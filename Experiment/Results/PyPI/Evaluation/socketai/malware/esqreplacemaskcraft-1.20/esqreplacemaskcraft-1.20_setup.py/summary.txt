  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which is characteristic of malware. While the setup function appears benign, the embedded payload and concealment tactics pose a significant security threat. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms its intent."
