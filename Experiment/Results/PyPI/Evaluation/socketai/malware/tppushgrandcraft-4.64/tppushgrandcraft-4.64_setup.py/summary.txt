  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The presence of a suspicious URL and obfuscation tactics strongly indicate malicious activity. The package should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms its payload. Scores of approximately 0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate."
