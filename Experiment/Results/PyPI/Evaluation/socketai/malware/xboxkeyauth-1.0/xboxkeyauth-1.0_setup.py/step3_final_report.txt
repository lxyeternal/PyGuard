{
  "purpose": "The code downloads remote Python code during package setup and executes it via exec(), then runs the temporary script with a system call, constituting a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/m3qfu/raw' accessed via urlopen in the embedded code.",
  "sinks": "exec() on remote content, system call executing the temporary script, leading to potential remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> exec() of fetched code -> system call to run temporary script.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded code that fetches and executes remote code during setup, use of system call to run a temporary file, suspicious URL, no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file containing Python code that fetches and executes remote code via urlopen and exec(). It then runs this script with a system call, enabling arbitrary remote code execution at install time. The URL is suspicious, and the pattern indicates malicious intent. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is highly dangerous, representing a supply chain attack vector. All reports correctly identify this pattern, with high scores for malware and security risk. The code's behavior warrants maximum severity assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, executing remote code during setup, posing a severe security threat. The malware score should be 1, the security risk score should be 1, and obfuscation remains at 0. The overall assessment confirms high malicious intent and risk.",
