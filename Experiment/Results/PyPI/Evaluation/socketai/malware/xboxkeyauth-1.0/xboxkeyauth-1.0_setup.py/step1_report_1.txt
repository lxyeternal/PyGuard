  "purpose": "Package setup script for 'xboxkeyauth' with malicious embedded code execution",
  "sources": "Reading dependencies, writing to a temporary file, executing system commands, fetching remote code",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing remote code, system call executing a temporary file, URL request fetching remote script",
  "flows": "Reading remote code via urlopen -> writing to temp file -> executing temp file -> running system command to start executable",
  "anomalies": "Temporary file containing obfuscated code that executes remote code, use of system command to start a process, remote code fetched via URL and executed dynamically",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from setuptools for package configuration. It then creates a temporary file and writes a Python script that fetches code from a remote URL and executes it via exec(). After closing the file, it runs a system command to start a new process with the temporary file. This process effectively downloads and executes external code at install time, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of exec() with remote data, combined with system commands to run the temporary file, indicates malicious intent or at least dangerous behavior. No other benign package setup features are present. The code is obfuscated in intent by fetching remote code and executing it dynamically.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes remote code at install time, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The overall security risk is high.",
