  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user input, environment variables, files, network interfaces, and data received from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmission, file writing, dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), and data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file systems, or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval()/exec() without confirmation, lack of explicit obfuscation, minimal suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or not provided; reports consistently indicate benign behavior with no obfuscation or malicious routines. The primary concern is the potential use of eval()/exec(), which, if confirmed, could elevate risk. Scores reflect low malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and low to moderate security risk (0.2-0.3). Confidence levels are high (≥0.8) due to consistent observations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The assessments are aligned with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to potential dynamic code execution or insecure network handling, but no concrete evidence supports higher threat levels. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
