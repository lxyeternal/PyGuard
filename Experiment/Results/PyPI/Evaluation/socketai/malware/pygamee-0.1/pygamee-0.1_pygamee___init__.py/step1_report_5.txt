  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing, with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, file input, and possibly environment variables, depending on implementation details.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files, logs, or network destinations; specific sinks are not explicitly shown but may include print statements or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, environment variables) through processing functions to output sinks (files, network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, following typical data processing steps. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No anomalies like hidden backdoors or suspicious network activity are evident. The code structure is clear and well-formed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script with no indications of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
