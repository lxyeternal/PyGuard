      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to evade static detection while performing covert system modifications, package installations, and privilege escalations. Its obfuscation, use of system modules, and conditional behaviors confirm a high threat level, warranting caution and further dynamic analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to potential dynamic code execution or insecure network handling, but no concrete evidence supports higher threat levels. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."
