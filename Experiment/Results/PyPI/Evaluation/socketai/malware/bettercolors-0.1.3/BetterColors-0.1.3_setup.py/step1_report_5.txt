  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'BetterColors' Python package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Embedded base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which imports modules and executes arbitrary code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes dynamically decoded code, which can run arbitrary, potentially malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded code executes import statements and possibly malicious code, then continues with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded base64 content is highly suspicious; code appears to import modules and run code that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'os', then proceeds to import and execute a base64-encoded string after decoding. This decoded string imports modules 'tempfile', 'NamedTemporaryFile', 'sys', 'os', 'ssl', and 'urllib.request', then performs HTTP requests to a suspicious URL ('https://pst.kgtrg.io/paste/7bup/r'), and writes to a temporary file, potentially exfiltrating data or executing malicious payloads. The decoded code is then closed, and the script continues with a typical setup() call for a Python package, which appears benign. The use of exec() to run decoded code that performs network requests and file operations indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or command and control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated malicious code executed via exec() from base64-decoded content, which performs network communication and file operations, indicative of malicious behavior. The remaining setup code appears standard but is likely used to mask the malicious activity. Overall, the package contains high malicious potential, with dangerous obfuscated code executed at runtime.",
