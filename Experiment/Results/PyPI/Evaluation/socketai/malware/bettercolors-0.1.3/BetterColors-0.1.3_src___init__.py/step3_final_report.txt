{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive terminal UI toolkit with colors, animations, ASCII art, and banner utilities. However, it contains a base64-encoded payload decoded and executed at runtime, which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, terminal size, user input, and executes a base64-decoded string via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() on decoded base64 payload, system commands via _system().",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 string and immediately executes it with exec(), then proceeds with UI functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large base64 string decoded and run via exec() at import time; obfuscation of payload; placeholders indicating incomplete or intentionally hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code's initial segment decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically, which is a classic indicator of malicious or backdoor code. The rest of the code appears to be a legitimate terminal UI library, but the initial payload's obfuscation and execution pose a significant security risk. The pattern of runtime decoding and execution of obfuscated code is highly suspicious and typical of malware tactics. The obfuscation level is high, and the execution occurs immediately upon import, making it a critical security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the runtime execution of an obfuscated base64 payload, which strongly suggests malicious intent or a backdoor. The rest of the code, while extensive and seemingly legitimate, is overshadowed by this red flag. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is substantial.",
