  "purpose": "This code provides a collection of terminal manipulation and visual formatting utilities, including color handling, cursor control, text centering, animated effects, and banner creation for terminal interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (_name), terminal size (_terminal_size), and user inputs (via input prompts). No external untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell commands (_system), console cursor control (via Windows API), and dynamic code execution through exec and compile on decoded base64 content.",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64 content, compiles it, and executes it dynamically, which can introduce arbitrary code execution if the base64 payload is malicious. Other flows include calls to _system for OS commands, and input prompts that could collect user data.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically decodes and executes base64-encoded payloads, which is suspicious and could hide malicious code. The code also includes obfuscated sections with encoded base64 strings and a self-imported compile and exec execution pattern. There are placeholder variables like '...' in some color definitions, which suggest incomplete or intentionally obscured code.",
  "analysis": "The script offers extensive terminal control functions, including color manipulation, cursor hiding/showing, and animated text effects, which are standard for terminal UI libraries. However, the initial part decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically, which is a common tactic for obfuscation or malicious code hiding. The presence of such dynamic code execution, combined with the obfuscated base64 payload, is a significant red flag. The rest of the code, while complex, appears to be an elaborate UI toolkit without direct malicious behavior. Still, the initial dynamic code execution introduces a high risk, as it could run malicious payloads concealed within the base64 string.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a terminal UI toolkit with advanced visual effects and controls. However, the initial obfuscated code segment dynamically decodes and executes code from a base64 string, which is highly suspicious and could be malicious. This behavior warrants a high-security concern due to potential hidden malicious payloads, despite the rest of the code appearing benign. Overall, the package should be treated as potentially malicious until the base64 payload is reviewed or removed.",
