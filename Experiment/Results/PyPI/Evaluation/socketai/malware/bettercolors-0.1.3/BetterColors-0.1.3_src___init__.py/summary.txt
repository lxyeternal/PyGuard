  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the runtime execution of an obfuscated base64 payload, which strongly suggests malicious intent or a backdoor. The rest of the code, while extensive and seemingly legitimate, is overshadowed by this red flag. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is substantial."
