  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious activity within the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell command execution.",
  "sources": "Presence of 'tahg' directory check; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, which could lead to remote code execution or payload download.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script runs the encoded PowerShell command silently, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', and error suppression with try-except blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a directory and, if absent, executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently. The obfuscation and stealth execution are typical in malicious scripts. The setup function appears standard, but the embedded command's purpose is suspicious. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.75) are justified by the obfuscation, silent execution, and potential for malicious payloads. Without decoding the payload, definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but suspicion is high. The red flags include obfuscation, hidden window execution, and error suppression, all common in malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The scores reflect significant concern, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious and subject to further analysis.",
