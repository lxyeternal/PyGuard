      "conclusion": "The setup.py is legitimate and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The dependencies could be exploited if the runtime code is malicious, but the setup script itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the risk score is slightly elevated due to dependencies capable of malicious activities. Overall, no changes are necessary; the code is benign, and the scores align with the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The provided code is highly suspicious and exhibits all characteristics of malicious malware, including heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and layered encoding. It is designed to conceal its true payload and execute potentially harmful code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score around 0.9, security risk around 0.9) are justified. The code should be treated as malicious, and further static and dynamic analysis in a secure environment is recommended before any execution or deployment."
