{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code that appears to perform dynamic code execution, likely for hiding malicious intent or payloads.",
  "sources": "Reads base64-encoded strings, dynamically decompresses and decodes data, and executes code via eval and exec functions, which can execute untrusted or hidden code.",
  "sinks": "eval and exec functions used to execute dynamically generated code, which may contain malicious payloads or commands.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded and compressed data is decoded, decompressed, transformed, and then executed via eval and exec functions, indicating possible payload delivery or obfuscated malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with multiple layers of encoding, compression, and dynamic code generation. Use of random functions, inline hex strings, and complex lambda functions suggest malicious intent to hide real actions. The code also appears to perform calculations that may influence execution flow unpredictably.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several modules (random, base64, codecs, zlib) commonly used for encoding, decoding, and data manipulation. It defines obfuscated strings and functions that decode, decompress, and evaluate code dynamically. The core part of the code involves decoding base64-encoded compressed data, transforming it through multiple layers, and executing the result using eval and exec. The complex and layered obfuscation is characteristic of malicious scripts attempting to conceal their payloads. The presence of hardcoded base64 strings that decode to potentially malicious code and the use of eval/exec strongly suggest malicious behavior. Overall, the script is designed to hide its true intent and execute hidden code, which may include harmful payloads or unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly obfuscated with multiple layers of encoding and dynamic execution, indicating malicious intent. It likely contains hidden payloads or commands executed at runtime, posing a significant security risk. The script is intended to conceal its true purpose, making it suspicious and dangerous to run.",
