{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python function that prints a message, with a comment referencing an external URL.",
  "sources": "No data input, no external data reads, no network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code executes a simple print statement without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip', which could be suspicious but is non-executable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function that performs no data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The only notable element is a comment referencing an external repository, which does not influence runtime behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious constructs justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0 to 0.1). The comments in the reports correctly identify the benign nature and the external reference as a red flag but do not overstate the risk. Overall, the code is safe, with negligible security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The external URL comment is not an active threat. Scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0.0-0.1 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
