  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple setup or installation script that prints a message during the installation process of a package named 'mi_paquete'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or where sensitive data might be leaked.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and straightforward; it does not contain obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic. The print statement could be used for informational purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python script that executes a single function 'setup()' when run as the main program. The 'setup()' function only prints a message indicating that a custom script is running during package installation. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no code that could be considered malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The script does not perform any harmful operations or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign setup script intended to inform the user during installation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
