  "purpose": "A minimal setup script that prints a message during installation.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data; it only executes a print statement within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to executing the setup() function during script run, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python script defining a setup() function that prints a message, called when the script runs as main. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No malicious or security-related behavior is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified as zero, with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely informational during package installation, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, non-malicious setup script with no security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
