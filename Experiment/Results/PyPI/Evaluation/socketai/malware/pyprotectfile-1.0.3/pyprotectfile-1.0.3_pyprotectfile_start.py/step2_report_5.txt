  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, straightforward setup script that prints a message during installation.\n- No external data sources, no data flows, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic are identified.\n- The scripts do not perform any harmful operations, handle sensitive data, or include any malicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be purely informational, providing feedback during package installation.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports' conclusions about benign nature are consistent and justified.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is very simple, there's little room for malicious activity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The print statement is harmless and typical for setup scripts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The current scoring seems reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, given the lack of obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk score should be 0, reflecting no threat.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
