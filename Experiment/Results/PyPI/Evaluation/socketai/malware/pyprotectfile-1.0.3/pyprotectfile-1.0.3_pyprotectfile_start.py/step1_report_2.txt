{
  "purpose": "The script appears to run a setup or initialization routine during the installation of a package named 'mi_paquete'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the execution context (via __name__ and the command-line environment), but does not explicitly read untrusted external input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output using print(), which is not inherently a security risk; no sensitive data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: if the script is executed as the main module, it calls the setup() function which prints a message. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. It simply prints a message during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup() function that prints a message indicating execution during package installation. It is invoked only if the script is run as the main module. There are no inputs, external data reads, or dangerous operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The script’s simplicity suggests it is just an informational or setup message.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple print operation during installation. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
