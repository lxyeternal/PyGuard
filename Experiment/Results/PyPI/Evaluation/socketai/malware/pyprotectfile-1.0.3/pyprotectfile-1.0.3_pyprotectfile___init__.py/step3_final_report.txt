  "sources": "No external data sources; the only reference is a comment mentioning a GitHub URL.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip' could be suspicious but does not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign function with no malicious logic, data flows, or obfuscation. The comment referencing an external repository is harmless and does not impact execution. Scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and low security risk. The only minor concern is the comment, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security risks. The comment referencing 'evilpip' is likely a placeholder or red herring. Scores are appropriate; the overall security assessment is that this code poses no threat.",
