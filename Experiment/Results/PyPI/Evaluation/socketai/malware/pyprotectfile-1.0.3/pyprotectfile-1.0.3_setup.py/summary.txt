  "conclusion": "The setup.py is legitimate and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The dependencies could be exploited if the runtime code is malicious, but the setup script itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the risk score is slightly elevated due to dependencies capable of malicious activities. Overall, no changes are necessary; the code is benign, and the scores align with the evidence."
