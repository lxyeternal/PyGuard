  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for 'pyprotectfile', which claims to perform file obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies list, and entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or output; dependencies could be exploited at runtime if malicious code exists elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows in this setup script; dependencies may be exploited during execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'sockets' as a dependency (potentially suspicious if not a standard package), and dependencies capable of privacy-invasive or automation activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. Dependencies include libraries like 'browser_cookie3', 'discord_webhook', 'pyautogui', 'getmac', and 'robloxpy', which can be used for automation, data collection, or privacy invasion if misused. No obfuscation or malware is present in this script. The scores from reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the setup, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low to moderate security risk (0.2-0.3) due to dependencies. The main concern is potential misuse at runtime, outside the scope of this setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is legitimate and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The dependencies could be exploited if the runtime code is malicious, but the setup script itself is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the risk score is slightly elevated due to dependencies capable of malicious activities. Overall, no changes are necessary; the code is benign, and the scores align with the evidence.",
