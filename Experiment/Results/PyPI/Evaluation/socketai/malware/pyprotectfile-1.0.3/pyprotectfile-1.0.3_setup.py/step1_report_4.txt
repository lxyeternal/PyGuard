{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyprotectfile', primarily intended to obfuscate files.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; dependencies are specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data are present; the script mainly declares dependencies and metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies and registers a command-line entry point; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package includes dependencies such as 'requests', 'browser_cookie3', 'discord_webhook', and 'robloxpy' which could be used for data exfiltration or interaction with external services. The inclusion of 'browser_cookie3' and 'discord_webhook' may indicate potential for privacy-invasive behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present in this snippet. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script, with typical metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include libraries that can be used for network communication, cookie extraction, and interacting with web services. While these libraries are legitimate, their combination warrants caution as they can be misused for privacy violations or data exfiltration if used maliciously. The setup process itself does not perform malicious actions. No anomalous code behavior or suspicious patterns are present in this snippet. The overall structure is typical of a legitimate package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package aimed at obfuscating files. Dependencies included could be used for potentially privacy-invasive or remote interaction purposes but are not inherently malicious in this context. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code alone.",
