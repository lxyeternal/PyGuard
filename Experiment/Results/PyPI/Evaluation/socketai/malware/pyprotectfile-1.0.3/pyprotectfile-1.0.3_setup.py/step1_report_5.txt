{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyprotectfile' package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependency list, and entry point definition from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution; standard setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup script defines dependencies and entry points without executing untrusted code or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Dependencies include suspicious or potentially risky packages such as 'sockets', 'pyautogui', 'browser_cookie3', 'discord_webhook', 'robloxpy'. The package 'sockets' may be a misleading or incorrect package (commonly the standard socket library is built-in). The inclusion of 'browser_cookie3', 'discord_webhook', and 'robloxpy' could be used for data collection or automation, which warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It lists multiple dependencies, some of which can be used for automation, network communication, or interacting with user environment data. No suspicious code execution, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The package 'sockets' appears to be a non-standard or possibly incorrect package name, which could be an attempt to mislead or could be a typo. Overall, the script itself is benign but the combination of dependencies suggests potential for misuse if malicious actors utilize this package to collect user data or automate malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign with no direct malicious code. However, the dependencies include potentially privacy-invading or automation-related packages that could be exploited for malicious purposes. There are no signs of embedded malware or malicious intent in this code alone, but caution is advised due to the nature of some dependencies.",
