{
  "purpose": "The script appears to execute a setup or installation step that prints a message, likely for logging or user information during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only executes a print statement within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, network, or environment variables; it only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as no external data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The script performs a simple print operation during execution; no suspicious or malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. It resembles a benign setup message.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup() function that outputs a message indicating a custom script execution during package installation. It is invoked only when the script runs as the main program. No external inputs, data processing, or potentially malicious operations are included. The script's behavior is straightforward and limited to printing a message, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple installation message. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contain obfuscated or suspicious code, or pose security risks.",
