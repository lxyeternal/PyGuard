  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that defines a setup() function which prints a message during installation.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data; only the print statement within setup().",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external communication occur.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution to calling setup(), which prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script defining a setup() function that outputs a message, invoked only when run as main. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's behavior aligns with the assessments, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
