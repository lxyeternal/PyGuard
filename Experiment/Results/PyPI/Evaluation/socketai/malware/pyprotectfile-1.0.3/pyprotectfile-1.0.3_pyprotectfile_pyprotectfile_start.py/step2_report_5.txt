  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple script that prints a message during installation.\n- No external inputs, data processing, or network activity are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The purpose appears purely informational.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The original code matches the described behavior: a straightforward script that defines `setup()` which prints a message, invoked when run as main.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n- No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are 0 or very close to 0, which is justified.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- Since the script is minimal and benign, there are no assumptions to challenge.\n- The reports do not overstate risk; they correctly identify the script as harmless.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- The code is a typical setup message script with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to a benign script with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the code remains simple and free of hidden malicious logic in future reviews.",
