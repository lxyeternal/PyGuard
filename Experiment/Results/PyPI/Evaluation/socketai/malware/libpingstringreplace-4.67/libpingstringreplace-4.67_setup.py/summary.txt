  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with suspicious URL references. These elements strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote control, data theft, or payload download. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify a high malware and security risk score. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current indicators warrant treating this package as malicious."
