      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The obfuscation, hidden process, and conditional trigger are typical of malicious backdoors or payload delivery mechanisms. While the exact payload is unknown, the pattern warrants caution and further analysis."
