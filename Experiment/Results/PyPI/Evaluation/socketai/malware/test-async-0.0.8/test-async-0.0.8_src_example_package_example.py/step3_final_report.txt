  "purpose": "A simple function that adds 1 to the input number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data sinks or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation and then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward addition function with no external dependencies, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign a confidence of 1, and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The simplicity and clarity of the code justify these assessments, with no anomalies or suspicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent and appropriate for this trivial utility function.",
