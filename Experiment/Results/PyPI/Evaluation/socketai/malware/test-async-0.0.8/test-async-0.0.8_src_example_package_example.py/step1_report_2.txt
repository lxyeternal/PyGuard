  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'add_one' that takes a single parameter and returns its value incremented by one. The logic is simple and standard. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code performs a benign mathematical operation without side effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial, non-malicious code snippet performing a basic addition. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
