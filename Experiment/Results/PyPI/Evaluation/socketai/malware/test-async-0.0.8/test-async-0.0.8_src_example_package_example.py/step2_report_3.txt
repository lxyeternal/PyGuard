  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and verify their claims against the original code.\n\n1. **Code verification**:  \nThe original code is:\n```python\ndef add_one(number):\n    return number + 1\n```\nIt is a straightforward function that adds 1 to the input parameter.\n\n2. **Presence of issues**:  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs a simple addition operation.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, external data sources, or obfuscation.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or complex logic are present.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the reports' reasoning and scores**:  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all, consistent with the code being clear and straightforward.\n- Malware scores are 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**:  \n- The reports assume the code is benign based solely on static analysis of a trivial function. Given the simplicity, this is reasonable.\n- No report suggests any hidden or obfuscated malicious intent, which is accurate.\n\n5. **Scores consistency and justification**:  \n- The scores are consistent and reasonable for this code.\n- Since the code is trivial and performs no malicious or suspicious operations, higher malware or security risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n6. **Overall assessment**:  \n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores for this code:\n  - **Malware**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n  - **Risk**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a simple, non-malicious utility function with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
