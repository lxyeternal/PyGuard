  "purpose": "The function adds one to a given number, serving as a simple arithmetic operation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (function argument)",
  "sinks": "Return statement (output of the function)",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into addition operation, producing output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and simple, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that takes a single input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no user input, no environment variable usage, nor network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code performs a trivial, benign operation typical in programming tutorials or simple applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs a simple arithmetic operation, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
