{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit indication of malicious intent, primarily performing routine operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not clearly identified; the code does not read user input, environment variables, or external data sources explicitly.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or system commands are present or invoked with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code executes straightforward operations without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated segments, or hard-coded secrets are detected. The code structure and formatting appear normal and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks external data sources, sinks, or dynamic execution paths that could indicate malicious activity. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script without obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or unauthorized system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign script with no indications of malware or suspicious activity.",
