  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external data fetches, potential dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs/credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file system, subprocess calls, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into sinks like network or system commands, potentially via eval/exec or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded endpoints or credentials, complex or suspicious data flows, dynamic code execution suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of benign data processing with no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Reports indicating high suspicion (e.g., eval/exec, hardcoded malicious endpoints, obfuscation) are justified. Low suspicion reports align with straightforward, transparent code. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are consistent with the described behaviors, with high suspicion reports justifying high scores. Slight adjustments could be made if eval/exec are confirmed, but current scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that most code is benign with low to moderate suspicion, except for reports with explicit suspicious behaviors, which are justified. Scores are consistent with the observations, and no major revisions are necessary.",
