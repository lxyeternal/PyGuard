{
  "purpose": "The code performs package setup while executing malicious activities: sending data externally, downloading and executing remote code, and potentially exfiltrating data.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), reading 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "POST request to Pastebin, writing remote code to a file, executing remote code via subprocess.",
  "flows": "GET requests retrieve code, POST request sends data, downloaded code is saved to a file with a random name, then executed asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "External network activity during import, remote code download and execution without validation, use of random filenames to obscure activity, sending data externally.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates network requests to external sites, exfiltrates data via POST, downloads code from a remote URL, writes it to a randomly named file, and executes it asynchronously. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by these malicious actions. The code's straightforward structure and external activity during import strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits active malicious behaviors including remote code download, execution, and data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9 or 1, security risk 0.85 or 1) are justified. Given the severity, a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1 are appropriate. The code should be considered highly malicious and avoided.",
