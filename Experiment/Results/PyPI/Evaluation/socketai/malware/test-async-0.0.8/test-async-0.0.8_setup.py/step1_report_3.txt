  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with additional code that downloads and executes remote scripts.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), reading README.md, and package setup functions.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded code via subprocess.Popen, writing files with remote content, and posting data to Pastebin.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() retrieves code, which is then written to a file and executed with subprocess.Popen. The initial requests.post() sends data to Pastebin. All these occur before setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads scripts from external URLs, writes them locally, and executes them without validation. The request to Pastebin posts a message '@everyone'. The filename for the downloaded script is randomly generated, making tracking difficult. These behaviors are suspicious and typical of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with an import of setuptools for package setup. It then attempts to import 'requests' and 'random'. Upon successful import, it performs a POST request to Pastebin, sending a message, which could be used for notification or spam. Next, it fetches code from a remote URL, saves it to a randomly named file, and immediately executes this code using subprocess.Popen. This pattern indicates remote code execution, which is highly suspicious. The latter part of the script reads a README file and proceeds with standard package setup, which appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious behavior at the start. The code lacks validation, integrity checks, or restrictions on the remote code, posing significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including fetching and executing remote scripts and posting messages to external services. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, with the initial code being used for remote code execution and potential backdoor setup. The package is unsafe to use.",
