{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with some metadata, dependencies, and a suspicious code block that fetches and executes remote scripts.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4' and 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode', reading 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded Python code via subprocess, writing to files, and posting data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Remote GET request to fetch malicious code -> writing to a temporary file -> executing that file with subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes: making unsolicited HTTP requests, executing remote code, and posting to a pastebin URL; the code dynamically executes fetched scripts without validation; use of random filenames for scripts; minimal documentation on intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setuptools for package setup, then in a try block, it imports 'requests' and 'random'. It performs a GET request to a Pastebin URL, retrieves its content, and POSTs a JSON payload with 'new run @everyone' to that URL, which could be a broadcast or notification. Then, it generates a random number, creates a filename based on that number, and writes the content fetched from a suspicious URL ('https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode') into this file. Immediately after, it executes this script via subprocess.Popen, passing 'shell=True'. This sequence indicates dynamic download and execution of remote code, which is highly suspicious and could be malicious. The exception block merely prints errors, providing little safety or logging. The remaining code is standard setup for a Python package, with no security concerns. The malicious code execution constitutes a significant security risk, potentially running arbitrary, harmful code on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains embedded malicious behavior: it downloads, writes, and executes remote code without validation, posing a high security threat. The setup code itself appears legitimate, but the initial try block indicates active malicious activity intended to run external scripts surreptitiously.",
