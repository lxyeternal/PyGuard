{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, but also contains suspicious code that attempts to exfiltrate data and execute remote scripts.",
  "sources": "Requests library fetching data from external URLs, file reading for README.md, and package setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to a pastebin URL, writing to a dynamically named .pyw file, executing the downloaded script via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Requests.get retrieves remote code/scripts; data is then written to a file; subprocess executes the downloaded code; requests.post transmits data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual and suspicious activities include remote data exfiltration with requests.post, dynamic code download and execution via subprocess, and use of external URLs that may host malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The initial import includes requests and random. Immediately, the code performs a POST request to a pastebin URL with a message, indicating possible data exfiltration. It then generates a random number, creates a filename based on this number, and writes content fetched from an external URL into this file. Subsequently, it executes this file asynchronously, which could contain malicious code. The remaining code is typical package setup code with no evident malicious intent. The malicious behavior is concentrated at the beginning, involving external network activity, dynamic code download, and execution, which are common techniques used in malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious activity primarily through external data exfiltration, dynamic remote code download, and execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious payloads executed at runtime.",
