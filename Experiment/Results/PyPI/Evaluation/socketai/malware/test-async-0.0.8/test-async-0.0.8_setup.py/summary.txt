  "conclusion": "The code exhibits active malicious behaviors including remote code download, execution, and data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9 or 1, security risk 0.85 or 1) are justified. Given the severity, a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1 are appropriate. The code should be considered highly malicious and avoided."
