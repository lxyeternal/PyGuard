  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to the embedded obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently based on a filesystem check. The pattern aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks or backdoors. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified, and the overall security risk is significant. Further analysis should decode the PowerShell command to confirm its intent, but current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious or compromised."
