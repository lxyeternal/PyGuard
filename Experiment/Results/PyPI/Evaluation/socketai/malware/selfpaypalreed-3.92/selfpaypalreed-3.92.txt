      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or data theft. The external URL and stealthy execution reinforce this. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until the payload is decoded and verified."
