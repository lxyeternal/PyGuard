  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, dynamic code execution points such as eval() or exec().",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, output streams.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system modifications), potentially via dynamic evaluation or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hidden network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual imports or code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no signs of malicious activity in reports 1-4, with benign data processing and controlled dynamic execution. Report 5 shows obfuscation, use of eval(), and network activity, indicating high suspicion. The malware score for reports 1-4 is appropriately zero; for report 5, a higher score (around 0.75) better reflects the suspicious patterns. Obfuscation scores align with the presence of obfuscated code segments. Risk scores are consistent with the level of suspicion, with report 5 warranting a high risk rating. Confidence levels are moderate to high, based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with low malware and risk scores. Report 5 demonstrates significant suspicious features, justifying elevated malware (~0.75) and obfuscation (~0.8) scores. Adjustments to report 2's malware score to around 0.2 are recommended to better reflect potential dynamic execution risks. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with report 5 requiring further scrutiny due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns.",
