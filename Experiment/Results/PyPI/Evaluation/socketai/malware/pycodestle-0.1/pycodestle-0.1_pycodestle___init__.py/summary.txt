  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with low malware and risk scores. Report 5 demonstrates significant suspicious features, justifying elevated malware (~0.75) and obfuscation (~0.8) scores. Adjustments to report 2's malware score to around 0.2 are recommended to better reflect potential dynamic execution risks. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with report 5 requiring further scrutiny due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns."
