{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package called 'esqposthackedver' with associated metadata and package dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem ('os.path.exists') and executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. It also reads package metadata from the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a potentially malicious obfuscated PowerShell command, which could be used to download or execute malicious payloads. The setup() function itself is unlikely to be malicious but could be exploited if used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file/directory, then potentially executes the obfuscated PowerShell command (source) via subprocess (sink). The package setup process is standard and unlikely to be malicious, but the execution of the PowerShell command represents a flow from source to malicious sink.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64, executed via subprocess without user consent. The presence of a comment with a suspicious URL ('//www.esquelesquad.rip') and the filename 'tahg' (possibly a trigger or marker). The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core, which is standard for Python packaging. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os', which are used to check for a specific directory ('tahg'). If the directory does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for running malicious code stealthily. The command is encoded in base64 and appears to be designed to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions, as indicated by the URL in the comment and the encoded command. The setup() call is standard packaging code but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may hide malicious behavior or errors. The overall structure indicates an attempt to silently execute malicious PowerShell code upon certain conditions, which could compromise the system if the code executes successfully.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command that is executed conditionally, likely intended to download or run malicious payloads. The package setup appears standard but is potentially used as a cover or delivery mechanism for malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated code, silent error suppression, and a suspicious URL strongly suggest malicious intent or at least malicious capability.",
