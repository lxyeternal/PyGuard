It encodes this data and exfiltrates it to a specific external IP address over an insecure SSL connection, which is a common pattern in malicious data theft or spyware. The absence of user notification, consent, or legitimate purpose further indicates malicious intent. The straightforward code structure and lack of obfuscation suggest intentional covert activity rather than benign system management. The insecure SSL context and hardcoded IP are typical of malicious exfiltration scripts designed to evade detection and facilitate unauthorized data transfer.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code exhibits clear malicious behavior characterized by covert collection and exfiltration of sensitive data to an external server with insecure SSL settings. It should be classified as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The behavior aligns with covert data theft or spyware activities, and no benign explanation justifies such extensive data exfiltration without user consent.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.9\n}",
