  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'importantpackage'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reading the file into 'long_description' which is then used in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a Markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup with package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include 'dnspython', which is a legitimate package. No code executes untrusted input, no network calls, and no malicious logic is present. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected. The setup configuration appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
