  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static metadata assignments; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external network calls, data leaks, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code lines (e.g., find_packages, python_requires); no suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, no user input, and no network activity. The presence of commented-out lines indicates incomplete configuration but not malicious intent. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The dependency 'dnspython' is legitimate. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
