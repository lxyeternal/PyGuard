  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'importantpackage'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted sources or potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads README content, then passes metadata to setuptools.setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and inconsistent classifiers (supports Python 2 and 3) may indicate oversight but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The commented lines suggest potential modifications but do not impact security. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The package appears safe based on the provided code.",
