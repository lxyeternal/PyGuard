  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that a package has been installed, including the project name.",
  "sources": "The setup.project_name attribute used in the message content.",
  "sinks": "The urllib.request.urlopen call that sends data to the hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The setup.project_name flows into the JSON payload, which is sent via an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation or exception handling; no obfuscation; straightforward network request.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that sends a notification to a fixed Discord webhook URL, including the project name. It uses standard libraries and performs a simple POST request. No malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The main concern is the exposed webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. No obfuscation or dynamic URL management is implemented. The code lacks exception handling, which could cause crashes but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.4, primarily due to the exposed URL. The code is benign in purpose but has a security concern regarding URL exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to send a notification upon installation. The primary security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. No malicious intent or malware is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to URL exposure, but the code itself is straightforward and safe.",
