  "purpose": "Send a notification to a Discord webhook after package installation.",
  "sources": "The setup.project_name attribute accessed during the message construction.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen, which sends data over the network to a specified URL.",
  "flows": "The code reads setup.project_name, constructs a message, and sends it via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if obtained by malicious actors. No validation or encryption of data. No user input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function post_install that constructs a JSON payload with the project name and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The URL is explicitly written in the code, which constitutes a security concern if the code is compromised or if the URL is leaked. The data sent is a simple notification message, and the network request is straightforward. No suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, credential theft, or backdoors is present. The use of urllib.request for network communication is standard. The presence of a hardcoded webhook suggests a potential privacy or security risk if this code is misused or if the webhook is maliciously targeted, but no active malicious behavior is present in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign action of notifying a webhook about package installation, but it uses a hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if misused. No malware or malicious intent is evident, but the hardcoded URL poses a security/privacy concern.",
