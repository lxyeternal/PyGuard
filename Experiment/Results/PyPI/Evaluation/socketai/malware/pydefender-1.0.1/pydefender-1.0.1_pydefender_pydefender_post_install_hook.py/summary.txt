  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to send a notification upon installation. The primary security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked. No malicious intent or malware is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to URL exposure, but the code itself is straightforward and safe."
