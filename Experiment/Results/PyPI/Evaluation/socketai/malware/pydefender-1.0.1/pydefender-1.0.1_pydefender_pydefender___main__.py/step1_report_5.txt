  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code that appears to execute dynamically decoded and potentially malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "eval() at the beginning, various decode and decode-b64decode calls, and multiple string decoding functions that process data and decode payloads.",
  "sinks": "exec() via eval, potentially executing dynamically decoded code, and multiple decode functions that process and interpret data, possibly exfiltrating or executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "eval() executes the result of multiple decoding functions that process encoded data. Data is decoded from base64 and hex, then decoded again and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using multiple layers of decoding, eval(), and dynamic execution, making static analysis difficult. The code reads and processes large encoded blobs, which may conceal malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by defining obfuscated variables and functions that decode base64 and hexadecimal encoded strings. It then decodes large binary-encoded payloads and passes them through multiple decoding layers. The final step involves decoding the payloads into strings and executing them via eval(). The heavy obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The payloads may include reverse shells, system info exfiltration, or other malicious activities, although the exact behavior is hidden behind decoding layers. The code does not contain any explicit safe or benign operations; instead, it focuses on decoding and executing concealed payloads, which is typical of malware or malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly obfuscated and designed to decode and execute hidden code dynamically. The usage of eval() on decoded payloads indicates malicious intent, as it can run arbitrary code. The multiple layers of encoding and decoding are typical of malware designed to evade static detection. Overall, the code likely performs malicious activities, such as system compromise or data exfiltration, once decoded and executed.",
