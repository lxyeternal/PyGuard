{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python script performing multiple layers of decoding, likely intended to conceal its true functionality.",
  "sources": "Decoding functions that read encoded strings, base64 decoding, and data transformations through multiple decode and eval calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing decoded code via eval, decoding base64 strings, and performing dynamic imports or execution with eval and exec.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded multiple times through base64 and custom decoding functions, then passed into eval and exec, leading to possible code execution of concealed malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with multiple eval and exec calls, repeated decoding layers, use of hardcoded encoded strings, and dynamic code execution functions, all indicating attempts to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining variables using eval on obfuscated strings, then decoding multiple layers of base64-encoded data through custom functions that decode strings and execute code dynamically. The presence of multiple eval() calls, dynamic string decoding, and base64 layers suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or commands. The final steps involve executing decoded code, which could be anything from malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The overall structure is characteristic of malware designed to evade static analysis and conceal its behavior via multiple decoding layers and dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated, uses multiple layers of decoding, and employs dynamic code execution techniques. It strongly indicates malicious intent, likely designed to run concealed payloads or backdoors. Due to its obfuscation and decoding complexity, it should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
