  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup.py with no malicious behavior.\n- Notes the inclusion of 'sockets' as a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.8.\n- Justification: No evidence of malicious code, just a probable typo.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the typo of 'sockets'.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.8.\n- Justification: Same reasoning, benign configuration with a minor typo.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the benign nature, mentions 'discord' keyword but not suspicious.\n- Also notes 'sockets' typo.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: No malicious activity, only a typo concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confirms the code is standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- Same typo concern.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: No malicious code, only a minor typo.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, no malicious behavior.\n- Typo of 'sockets' noted.\n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree there is no malicious code present. The setup script is standard and contains no code execution or obfuscated code. The only anomaly is the 'sockets' dependency, which is not a real package and likely a typo for 'socket' (a standard library module). This does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the straightforward setup script.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly around 0.1-0.2, justified by the typo which could cause installation issues but not security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.1 (minor typo, no security threat)\n\n**Additional note:** The typo of 'sockets' should be corrected to 'socket' (or removed if intended as a standard library module), but this is a documentation/configuration issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, straightforward setup script.                         |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1          | Minor typo, unlikely to cause security issues.             |\n\n**Overall, the package setup appears safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.**",
