  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'pydefender', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, especially 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sockets' in dependencies is unusual, but merely a package name, not code execution. No code execution or dynamic behavior present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No code is executed beyond defining the setup parameters. The dependencies include various packages, some of which (e.g., 'requests', 'pycryptodome', 'discord_webhook') are common, but packages like 'sockets' (likely intended as 'socket') could indicate a typo or unusual dependency, though it alone is not malicious. The script does not contain code that reads input, executes dynamic code, or interacts with external systems at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The dependencies list is extensive but not inherently suspicious. No malicious code or supply chain threats are evident from this code fragment.",
