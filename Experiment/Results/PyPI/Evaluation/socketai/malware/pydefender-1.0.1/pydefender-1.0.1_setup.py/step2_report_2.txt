  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code detected; dependencies are standard. The 'sockets' dependency is a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a minor dependency typo.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; no malicious code. The 'sockets' dependency is invalid, likely a typo.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a dependency typo.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; no malicious code. 'sockets' is invalid.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 or 0.2 acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, minor typo.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; dependencies typical; 'sockets' typo.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2 reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious code; 'sockets' typo.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The package is a standard setup script with no code execution or suspicious patterns. **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated due to the 'sockets' typo, which could cause installation issues but not a security risk. Given the consistency, a risk score around **0.1-0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n- **Dependency Issue:** The 'sockets' dependency is invalid; it should be 'socket' (a standard library module, not a package). This is a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (due to the typo, but not a security threat)\n- **Security Risk:** Low, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with a minor typo in dependencies. No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based on the evidence, I would concur with a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1).",
