  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'pydefender' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields, dependencies list, including 'requests', 'sockets', 'pypiwin32', etc.",
  "sinks": "Installation process, dependency resolution, package metadata parsing.",
  "flows": "Dependency list read during installation; package metadata accessed during build.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'sockets' in dependencies, which is not a valid package name (likely a typo). No dynamic code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata and dependencies. The 'sockets' entry is invalid and likely a typo for 'socket' or 'socketserver', both standard libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. The dependency list includes common packages for network, cryptography, and automation tasks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed. The typo does not introduce malicious behavior but could cause installation issues. Overall, the script is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only issue is the typo in the dependencies list, which should be corrected for proper installation. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1 due to the typo but not a security threat.",
