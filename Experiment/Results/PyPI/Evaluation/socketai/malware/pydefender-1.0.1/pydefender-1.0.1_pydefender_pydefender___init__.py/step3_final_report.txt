{
  "purpose": "A trivial placeholder function that prints a static message, with a comment referencing an external URL.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; only a comment referencing a URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function only prints a static message with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip', which could be suspicious but does not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function that outputs a static message, with no input, data processing, or external network activity. The only red flag is the comment referencing a potentially malicious URL, but the code does not interact with it. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero, and the security risk is minimal. The comment may be a red herring or documentation, but it does not indicate malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The external URL comment does not impact the code's security assessment. Therefore, malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should all be 0.0.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
