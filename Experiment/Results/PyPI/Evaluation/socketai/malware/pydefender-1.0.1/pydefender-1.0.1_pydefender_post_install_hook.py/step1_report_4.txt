  "purpose": "Send a notification to a Discord webhook upon successful installation of a package",
  "sources": "The code reads no external untrusted input but contains hardcoded data within the script",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a remote Discord webhook URL",
  "flows": "No external input sources; the code constructs a message and posts it directly to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Contains a hardcoded webhook URL that sends a message upon installation; no input validation or user control over the data sent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'post_install' that, when invoked, sends a fixed notification message to a specific Discord webhook URL indicating successful package installation. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could be a security concern if the URL is malicious or compromised. The code does not accept external input, so it does not process untrusted data. It performs a straightforward HTTP POST request with JSON data. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modification. The purpose appears to be merely notifying about installation, but the hardcoded webhook URL may be used for tracking or malicious notification purposes if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a simple notification upon package installation, which itself is not malicious. However, the presence of a hardcoded webhook URL that sends messages automatically can be used for tracking or potentially malicious purposes if the webhook is controlled by an attacker. Overall, the code is benign but could be exploited for malicious tracking if the webhook URL is malicious or unauthorized.",
