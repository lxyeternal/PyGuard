  "purpose": "Send a notification to a Discord webhook upon package installation",

  "flows": "setup.project_name → data payload → HTTP request to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked; no input sanitization or validation observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function post_install that constructs a message containing the package's project name and sends it to a fixed Discord webhook URL. The URL is hardcoded, which could be a concern if the code is distributed or modified. The function is triggered during package installation, which might be used for tracking purposes or malicious monitoring if the webhook is controlled by an attacker. No user input is processed here, but the hardcoded webhook URL could be misused. The code does not obfuscate or hide its intentions; it straightforwardly sends a message. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. The main concern is the hardcoded webhook, which could be exploited or used maliciously if the package is compromised or intentionally designed to notify a remote server.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign action—sending a notification upon installation—but uses a hardcoded webhook URL, which poses a security concern if misused or leaked. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, but the use of a fixed webhook URL warrants caution.",
