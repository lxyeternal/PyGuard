  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality, performing a straightforward notification during package installation. The primary security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if compromised. No active malware or malicious behavior is present. The scores reflect low malware risk, no obfuscation, and a moderate security concern due to static URL usage."
