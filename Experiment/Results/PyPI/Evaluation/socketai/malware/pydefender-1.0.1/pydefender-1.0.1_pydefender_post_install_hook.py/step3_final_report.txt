  "purpose": "Send a notification message to a Discord webhook during package installation, indicating successful setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package setup object to access 'setup.project_name'. It does not read external untrusted input; the webhook URL is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP POST request to a fixed Discord webhook URL with a JSON payload containing the package name.",
  "flows": "Source: 'setup.project_name' used in message content -> Sink: HTTP request to webhook URL with constructed JSON payload.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation; straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a JSON message including 'setup.project_name' and sends it via a POST request to a fixed Discord webhook URL. No malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system damage are evident. The main concern is the static webhook URL, which could be exploited if leaked or misused. The code is simple, with no obfuscation, and performs a benign notification task. Malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. Security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4) due to the static URL. The overall behavior is benign but with a security concern related to static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality, performing a straightforward notification during package installation. The primary security issue is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited if compromised. No active malware or malicious behavior is present. The scores reflect low malware risk, no obfuscation, and a moderate security concern due to static URL usage.",
