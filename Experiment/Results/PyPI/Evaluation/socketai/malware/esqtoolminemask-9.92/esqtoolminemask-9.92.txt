      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, with silent error handling, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely compromised or used as a vector for malicious payloads. The observed behavior warrants treating this package as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding and analysis of the payload."
