      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with error suppression and conditional triggering. The pattern aligns with common tactics for malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. Scores assigned in reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as highly suspicious or malicious until further decoding confirms benign intent."
