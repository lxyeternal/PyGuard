{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves a GCE service account token from the internal metadata server and exfiltrates it to an external ngrok URL, indicating credential theft and malicious exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Requests to the metadata server at 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'",
  "sinks": "POST request sending the token data to 'https://cd1f-67-205-141-215.ngrok-free.app/log'",
  "flows": "Source: metadata server token fetch -> Sink: POST request to external URL with token data",
  "anomalies": "Unencrypted transmission of sensitive token to an external server; use of ngrok URL; no validation or user consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a sensitive GCE token and immediately transmits it to an external server, which is indicative of credential exfiltration. The process involves a GET request to the internal metadata server, capturing the token, and a POST request to an external URL, likely for malicious purposes. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or hidden logic, and the external URL is suspicious. This pattern aligns with malicious activity aimed at stealing credentials. The behavior is consistent, and the absence of obfuscation confirms straightforward malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs credential theft by exfiltrating a GCE service account token to an external server. The activity is malicious, high-risk, and consistent with supply chain sabotage or malicious insider activity. The high malware score (1) and security risk score (0.9) are justified given the credential exfiltration behavior.",
