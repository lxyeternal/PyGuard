  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve a Google Compute Engine instance's default service account token and send it to an external server via a POST request.",
  "sources": "Retrieving token from 'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token'; reading response text.",
  "sinks": "Sending token data via POST request to 'https://cd1f-67-205-141-215.ngrok-free.app/log'.",
  "flows": "Token retrieved from GCE metadata server → stored in 'token' variable → sent as data in POST request to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of GCE internal metadata server indicates an attempt to access potentially sensitive credentials; sending data to an external ngrok URL suggests possible exfiltration. No user input is involved, but the behavior indicates data leakage or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script accesses the internal GCE metadata server to obtain a service account token, which is a sensitive credential. It then transmits this token to an external server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior resembles credential theft or unauthorized data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation, logging, or user interaction, and the use of ngrok (commonly used for tunneling) suggests an attempt to hide or exfiltrate sensitive data. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present; the code is straightforward but exhibits malicious activity in stealing and transmitting credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent as it collects a potentially sensitive token from the internal metadata server and transmits it to an external server without authorization. This constitutes credential theft and data exfiltration, indicating high malicious risk.",
