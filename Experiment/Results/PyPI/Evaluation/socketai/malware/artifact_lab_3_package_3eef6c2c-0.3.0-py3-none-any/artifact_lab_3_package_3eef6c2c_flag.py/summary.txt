  "conclusion": "The script performs credential theft by exfiltrating a GCE service account token to an external server. The activity is malicious, high-risk, and consistent with supply chain sabotage or malicious insider activity. The high malware score (1) and security risk score (0.9) are justified given the credential exfiltration behavior."
