  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no code execution, data handling, or output generation.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the file is a standard, empty __init__.py with only comments.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only comments indicating it can be left empty or used for initialization. No code, data processing, or suspicious patterns are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this file, with scores reflecting no obfuscation, no malware, and no security risk. The scores are consistent with the content, and the confidence level is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
