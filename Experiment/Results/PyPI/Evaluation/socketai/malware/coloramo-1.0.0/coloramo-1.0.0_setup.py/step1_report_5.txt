{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'coloramo' and includes a custom installation class that executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and executes a decrypted Fernet-encrypted string.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'exec' on decrypted code is a critical sink that can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment info (os.name) triggers conditional code, leading to importing modules and executing decrypted code via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key, encrypted payload executed via exec, conditional execution based on OS, and inclusion of 'requests' module which is often used for network activity. The description and long_description are nonsensical strings, possibly obfuscation or padding.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up package metadata and includes a custom install class. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, and executes the decrypted code. The encrypted payload could contain malicious commands or data exfiltration. The use of encrypted payloads and execution of arbitrary code at install time indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, such as backdoor installation or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior; it decrypts and executes code during package installation on Windows systems, likely for unauthorized or harmful activities. The overall security risk is high due to the encrypted payload execution and conditional malicious code execution.",
