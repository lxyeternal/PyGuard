  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload, with suspicious URL comment and stealthy behavior. The overall security risk and malware scores are justified at approximately 0.8-0.85, reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent."
