  "purpose": "Initialization for the Python package, possibly to set up package-level configurations or imports.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code does not perform any operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The file is either empty or contains only a comment, with no executable code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is an empty or comment-only __init__.py file. It neither reads input nor writes output. There are no functions, variables, or logic that could be exploited or that perform malicious actions. This is typical for package initialization files, which often remain empty or contain minimal setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no executable statements or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign package initializer with no security concerns.",
