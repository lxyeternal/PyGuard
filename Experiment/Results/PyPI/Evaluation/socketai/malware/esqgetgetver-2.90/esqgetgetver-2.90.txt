      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The silent execution, obfuscation, and external suspicious URL justify high malware and risk scores. The setup() function appears benign but is likely exploited as a delivery vector. Overall, the package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms safety."
