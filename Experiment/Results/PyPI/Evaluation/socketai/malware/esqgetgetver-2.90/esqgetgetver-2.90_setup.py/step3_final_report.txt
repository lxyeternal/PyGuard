  "purpose": "Execute a PowerShell command encoded in base64 when the 'tahg' directory does not exist, likely for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess with encoded PowerShell command",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> subprocess.Popen with encoded command",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed silently with hidden window; silent error handling; suspicious URL in comments",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, runs a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. The command is obfuscated, pointing to a suspicious domain ('esquelasquad.rip'), and is executed without user visibility. The setup() function appears legitimate, but the malicious payload execution is embedded before it. Silent error handling conceals failures. The obfuscation and external URL strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly for remote code execution or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The silent execution, obfuscation, and external suspicious URL justify high malware and risk scores. The setup() function appears benign but is likely exploited as a delivery vector. Overall, the package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms safety.",
