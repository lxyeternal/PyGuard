  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'BeautiflulSoop', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), executing decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary code on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "os.name check → import requests & Fernet → decrypts and executes code via exec() if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hard-coded Fernet key to decrypt and execute code dynamically during installation. The code within exec() is encrypted, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup for a Python package but includes a custom install command that, on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via exec(). The use of a hardcoded key and encrypted payload is unusual and potentially malicious, as it enables execution of arbitrary code during installation, likely with elevated privileges. The rest of the code appears typical for a setup script, but the dynamic code execution constitutes a security concern. The encrypted code could perform malicious actions, such as connecting to external servers, stealing data, or installing backdoors. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The package's setup script includes a hidden backdoor mechanism: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes code, which is highly suspicious. The overall risk score is elevated due to this dynamic code execution, which could be malicious. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate.",
