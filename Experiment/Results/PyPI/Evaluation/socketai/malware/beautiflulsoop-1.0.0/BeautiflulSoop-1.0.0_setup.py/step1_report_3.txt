  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, executing encrypted code with Fernet during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code which could run arbitrary Python code with elevated privileges.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, decrypts and executes code via Fernet, which could run malicious commands or download further payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted code execution during setup, minimal descriptive metadata, use of encryption to hide code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that includes a class with an obfuscated name inheriting from 'install'. Inside its run method, on Windows ('nt'), it decrypts a payload using Fernet and executes it with exec(). The decrypted payload is a block of code, potentially malicious, executed at installation time. The package metadata appears normal, but the presence of encrypted code execution during setup is suspicious. The code’s obfuscation and encrypted execution are common indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. The package claims to install certain dependencies but mainly seems to execute hidden code during installation, which could perform malicious actions such as downloading payloads, executing arbitrary commands, or exfiltrating data.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes arbitrary Python code during installation on Windows, indicating malicious intent. The encrypted execution is a strong indicator of sabotage or malicious behavior, with potential for remote code execution or further malicious actions during package installation.",
