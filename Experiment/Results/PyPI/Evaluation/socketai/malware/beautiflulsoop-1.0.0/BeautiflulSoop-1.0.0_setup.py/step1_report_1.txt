{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes decrypted code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), and executing decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "If os.name == 'nt', requests and Fernet are imported, then code is decrypted and executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The code decrypts a payload and executes it dynamically without any validation. The decrypted data is a string of arbitrary characters. The use of Fernet with a hardcoded key is suspicious, as it indicates possible concealed malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up package metadata and includes a custom install command. The custom command checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it via exec(). The payload being decrypted is not clear, but executing decrypted code directly is highly suspicious, as it can hide malicious operations such as data exfiltration, system modifications, or malware installation. The use of a hardcoded key and the dynamic execution suggest malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. No other suspicious network activity or credential handling is observed elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: decrypting and executing an arbitrary payload during installation on Windows systems. This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially used to run malicious code covertly during package installation.",
