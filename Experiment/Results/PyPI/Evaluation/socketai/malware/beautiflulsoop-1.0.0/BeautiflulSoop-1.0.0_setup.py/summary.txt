  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious behavior, acting as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism during package installation. The encrypted payload execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded keys strongly suggest malicious sabotage. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the pattern warrants serious concern and further investigation."
