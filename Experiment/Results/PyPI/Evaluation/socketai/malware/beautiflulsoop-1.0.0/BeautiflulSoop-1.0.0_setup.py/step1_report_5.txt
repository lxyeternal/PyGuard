{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes an obfuscated custom install command which executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and executes a decrypted payload via exec() within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can be malicious if the payload is harmful or altered. No other explicit sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow decrypts and executes code during installation if on Windows (nt), leading from the class run() method to exec() with decrypted data.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical names. The decrypted payload is encrypted, and execution occurs during setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The description and long description are random strings, possibly placeholders or decoys.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with metadata and a custom installation command class. The custom class overrides run() to perform actions: it checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', and executes code decrypted from a hardcoded Fernet key. The encrypted payload is a string that, once decrypted, is executed via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because executing dynamically decrypted code during package installation can be a vector for malicious activity. The obfuscated class name and the encrypted payload suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The rest of the setup appears standard, but the core suspicious activity is the decryption and execution of code at install time, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated behavior that decrypts and executes code during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or supply chain risk. This pattern is often used for backdoors or malware delivery. The rest of the package setup is normal, but the encrypted payload execution is concerning.",
