{
  "purpose": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, if on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code via exec(). The code decrypts a hardcoded payload with a Fernet key and runs it, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The custom install class during run() on Windows, specifically the import of Fernet, decryption of a hardcoded encrypted string, and execution via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() call executing decrypted code, which can run arbitrary malicious code on the user's system.",
  "flows": "OS check (nt) -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt hardcoded payload -> execute payload via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, obfuscated class name, absence of validation or sandboxing, execution of arbitrary code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a fixed Fernet key and executes it via exec() during installation on Windows. The payload is opaque, suggesting obfuscation. The class name is nonsensical, and no validation or sandboxing is performed. This pattern is characteristic of malicious backdoors or supply chain sabotage. The high scores assigned in reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9, obfuscated 0.8) are justified given the behavior. The encrypted payload and dynamic execution during setup pose a significant security threat, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious behavior, acting as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism during package installation. The encrypted payload execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded keys strongly suggest malicious sabotage. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the pattern warrants serious concern and further investigation.",
