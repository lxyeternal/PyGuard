  "purpose": "A simple Python script defining and calling a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code with no data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Print statement, which outputs static text; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Function call flow from definition to invocation; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and then calls it. It contains no input sources, no external dependencies, no data processing, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is trivial and benign. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
