{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation process that triggers a network request and potentially downloads and executes an external executable during installation.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], requests.get() calls to external URLs",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing downloaded file, network requests fetching external resources",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> requests.get() to send info; requests.get() to download executable -> os.system() executes the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to send system information to an external server and downloads and executes a file from a suspicious domain during installation. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' are suspicious, potentially malicious. The code suppresses exceptions, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a send() function that captures the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via GET request to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a dubious domain and executes it immediately. The custom PostInstallCommand runs this send() function during package installation. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at collecting system info and installing potentially harmful software without user consent. The URL domains are suspicious and likely malicious. Exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential failures or malicious activity. Overall, the code performs actions that are typical of malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info, communicating with suspicious domains, and downloading and executing external executables during installation. The activities suggest a security risk and possible malware delivery, warranting caution or avoidance.",
