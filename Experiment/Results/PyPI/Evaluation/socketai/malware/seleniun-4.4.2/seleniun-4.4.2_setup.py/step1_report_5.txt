{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'seleniun' that installs dependencies and runs post-install actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs via requests.get, and os.system call to execute downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing potentially malicious executable, network request sending data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends data to external URL -> downloads and executes a file based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "Download and execution of external file during installation, sending system information to an external server, no validation or user consent, use of broad exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, possibly leaking system info. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it automatically, which is highly malicious behavior. The code runs during package installation without user consent. The broad except block masks errors, which could hide malicious intent or failures. The overall behavior indicates active malicious activity, potentially for remote control, malware deployment, or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script performs malicious actions by sending system info to an external server and downloading and executing an unverified executable, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The code is designed to compromise the system during installation.",
