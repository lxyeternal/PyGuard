{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'seleniun', which performs some installation tasks and includes a function that communicates with an external server and downloads an executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', the URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ' concatenated with the environment variable, and the URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' used for downloading an executable.",
  "sinks": "Executing the downloaded file with 'os.system', sending HTTP GET requests to external servers, and reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL sent via requests.get; if on Windows, the code downloads an executable and runs it via os.system, which could execute malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently ignores exceptions, downloads an executable from an external source, and automatically executes it during the installation process. These behaviors are unusual and suspicious in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, including 'requests'. It defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to an external URL, and, if on Windows, downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious domain. The 'PostInstallCommand' runs this 'send' function after installation. The setup configuration overrides the default install command with this custom behavior. This pattern indicates that malicious code may be embedded to perform unauthorized actions during package installation, such as executing arbitrary code from external sources, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it contacts external servers, exfiltrates environment information, downloads and executes a potentially harmful executable during package installation, and handles exceptions silently. These behaviors suggest a malicious supply chain attack.",
