  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, with additional code to send environment data and potentially download and execute a file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs for HTTP GET requests, and code execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing a downloaded file with os.system.",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sending data to a remote server -> downloading a file from a suspicious URL -> executing the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional try-except block that suppresses errors, downloading and executing a file from a suspicious URL, sending environment info to an external server without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and additional modules, then defines a 'send()' function that attempts to retrieve the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and send it via a GET request to a suspicious URL. It also downloads a potentially malicious executable from a dubious domain and runs it via os.system. The PostInstallCommand class ensures this 'send()' function is invoked during installation. The setup configuration is standard, but the inclusion of data exfiltration and remote code execution mechanisms is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information, downloads and executes a potentially harmful file, and does so covertly during package installation. These actions suggest the package is designed to perform unauthorized actions and potentially harm or compromise systems.",
