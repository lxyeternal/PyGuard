{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system environment info, downloads a potentially malicious executable, and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads from environment variables; network requests to external URLs; downloads and writes files to disk.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; writing executable files; executing downloaded files via os.system.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable) -> network request (exfiltration); download executable -> save to disk -> execute via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling; downloading and executing external code during setup; use of suspicious URLs; executing code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment info, exfiltrates it via HTTP GET, downloads an executable from a suspicious domain, and runs it silently during installation. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors. The URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded code poses a high security risk. These behaviors are characteristic of supply chain malware. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the malicious actions are active and deliberate.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation. The behavior justifies a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated. All evidence indicates a high-severity supply chain attack vector.",
