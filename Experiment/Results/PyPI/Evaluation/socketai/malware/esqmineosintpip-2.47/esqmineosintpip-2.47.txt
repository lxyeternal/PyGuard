      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger based on filesystem state are typical of malware delivery mechanisms. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified; the overall threat level is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
