  "purpose": "Import the class 'Amil' from the 'taban' module within the 'MuktesiTABAN' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'MuktesiTABAN.taban' module during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible beyond module import; no runtime data flow observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement appears standard; no hardcoded secrets, unusual syntax, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import operation from a package named 'MuktesiTABAN'. There are no dynamic code executions, no use of eval or exec, and no suspicious patterns. The package and module names appear standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Since this is only an import statement, there is minimal surface for malicious behavior. Without additional code, there are no indicators of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal part of Python module usage, assuming the package itself is trustworthy.",
