  "purpose": "Import the 'Amil' class or function from the 'taban' module within the 'MuktesiTABAN' package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'MuktesiTABAN.taban' module to load 'Amil'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code; no data processing or output occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is just an import statement without execution of functions or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a non-standard package name 'MuktesiTABAN' with mixed case, which is uncommon but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class or function from a module within a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, execution of untrusted code, or obfuscated logic. The structure is simple and appears to be a normal import statement. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred. The package name 'MuktesiTABAN' does not indicate malicious intent on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This line is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger codebase and by itself does not raise security concerns.",
