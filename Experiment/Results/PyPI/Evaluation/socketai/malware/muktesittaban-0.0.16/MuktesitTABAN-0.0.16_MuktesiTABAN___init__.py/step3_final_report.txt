{
  "purpose": "Import the class Amil from the module taban within the MuktesiTABAN package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module MuktesiTABAN.taban to access the class Amil.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "The import loads the module and class into the namespace; no data flows or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual casing in package name (MuktesiTABAN) but no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static import statement with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The package name's casing is unconventional but not malicious. No data flow, sink, or external communication is present. The minimal context indicates benign intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score correctly remains at zero. Further analysis would require inspecting the contents of 'Amil' or runtime behavior, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
