  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'MuktesitTABAN'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only loads data for setup purposes.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content -> uses package metadata -> installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and reads a local README file for description. It defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. No external data sources or sinks, no suspicious functions or hidden code. The dependencies are common Python packages, and the setup script is straightforward and standard for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
