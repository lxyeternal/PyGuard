{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'MuktesitTABAN' to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, email, description, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious effects are present in this script.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> sets package metadata and dependencies -> calls setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (beyond standard package metadata), or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for package configuration. It reads a README file for documentation, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, network connections, or obfuscated code are present. Dependencies are specified explicitly, and the script adheres to typical package setup practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for publishing a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution purposes.",
