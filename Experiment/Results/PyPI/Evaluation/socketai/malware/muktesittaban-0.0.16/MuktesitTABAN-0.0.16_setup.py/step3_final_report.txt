  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'MuktesitTABAN', configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses hardcoded package metadata and dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file, then proceeds to package setup with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script utilizing standard modules and practices. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All dependencies are common Python packages, and the script does not perform any runtime operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
