  "purpose": "Set up script for packaging a Python project named 'MuktesitTABAN', defining metadata, dependencies, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, static strings for version, description, author info, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or execute untrusted code; setup configuration does not perform runtime actions beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> uses hardcoded metadata -> defines install_requires dependencies -> package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata, or suspicious operations. The code is typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for setup, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No code execution or user input handling is present. The dependencies listed are common packages for Python projects. No malicious patterns such as network calls, code execution, or credential handling are detected. The structure follows typical setup.py conventions with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs standard setup tasks without any malicious intent.",
