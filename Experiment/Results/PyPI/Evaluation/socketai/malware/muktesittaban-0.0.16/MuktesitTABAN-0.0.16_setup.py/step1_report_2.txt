{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package named 'MuktesitTABAN' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports package data from the 'setuptools' and 'os' modules; reads package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network connections, file writes, or command executions are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> assigns metadata variables -> calls setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The email address appears normal but is hardcoded; no suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads metadata and dependencies for package setup using standard 'setuptools' functions. It reads a README file for the description and defines package info, author, email, and dependencies. The code does not execute any untrusted data, does not perform network activities, nor contains hidden or malicious behavior. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, and the code structure is typical for Python package setup scripts. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
