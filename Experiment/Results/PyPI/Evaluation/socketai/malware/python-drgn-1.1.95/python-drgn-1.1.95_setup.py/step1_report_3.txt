  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('ipconfig'), requests.get('http://ifconfig.me'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "requests.post(webhook, payload) - sending system info data to Slack webhook",
  "flows": "System info commands (sources) collect data, which is then formatted and sent via HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information and sends it unencrypted to an external Slack URL without any apparent user consent or transparency. The webhook URL appears hardcoded. The code also comments out a potentially malicious curl command. The data exfiltration is potentially malicious if done without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the install process of a Python package, gathering system details such as OS info, IP address, hostname, username, and current directory. It then formats this data into a JSON payload and sends it to an external Slack webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, potentially indicating malicious activity if performed without user consent. The use of system commands to gather detailed info and the transmission to an external service are suspicious. There is no evidence of malicious code execution or backdoors, but the privacy-invasive behavior and data exfiltration are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed to collect and transmit system information to an external server without clear user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It does not perform malicious actions like damaging files or mining cryptocurrency but poses privacy risks. The hardcoded webhook URL and data collection are noteworthy. Overall, the code exhibits potentially malicious behavior focused on data exfiltration.",
