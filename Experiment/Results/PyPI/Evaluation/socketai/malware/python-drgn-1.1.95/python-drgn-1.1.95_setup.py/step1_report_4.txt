  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system info using os.popen() for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'whoami', and 'hostname'; makes HTTP GET request to 'http://ifconfig.me'; posts data to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sends data to Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected via system commands and HTTP GET request flows into the payload that is posted to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection of sensitive system info (hostname, user, IP, OS info) and sending to an external webhook without user consent or verification. Use of os.popen() with system commands can be insecure; no validation of data. Hardcoded webhook URL with no obfuscation. The code comments out a potentially suspicious cURL command, indicating awareness of data posting. No authentication or encryption is implemented for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during package setup. It collects system-specific data using 'os.popen()' calls, which run shell commands like 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'whoami', and 'hostname'. It also makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://ifconfig.me' to obtain the public IP address. All collected data is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via 'requests.post()' to a Slack webhook URL. The data collection occurs unconditionally, regardless of user consent or environment. The code is intended to run on different platforms ('darwin', 'linux', 'win32'), adapting commands accordingly. No input validation, encryption, or authentication measures are present, and the webhook URL is hardcoded. This behavior indicates potential privacy violations, data exfiltration, or malicious surveillance activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external webhook without user approval or security measures, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The hardcoded webhook and unconditional data exfiltration are suspicious. While there is no evidence of direct system compromise or malware, the code's intent to spy on or leak user data suggests malicious activity.",
