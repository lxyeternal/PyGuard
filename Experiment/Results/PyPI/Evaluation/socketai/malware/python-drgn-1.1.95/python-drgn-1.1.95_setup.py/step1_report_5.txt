  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'whoami', 'hostname'; requests.get for public IP; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to send data to Slack webhook with system info; potentially untrusted data flow if input can be manipulated.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via os.popen() and requests.get(), then formatted into payload and sent via requests.post() to Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects detailed system info and sends it to external service without user consent or explicit notification. The code includes a commented-out curl command which suggests prior manual data transmission. The information flow could be used maliciously to exfiltrate system details.",
  "analysis": "The script runs during installation, collects hostname, user info, IP addresses, and OS info via os.popen calls. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this data and posts it to a Slack webhook URL. The code does not sanitize or verify the data; it uses external requests and system commands, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised. The data collection is extensive and performed silently, indicating potential privacy violations. No malicious code such as reverse shells, code injection, or destructive actions is present. However, the secret webhook URL is hardcoded and could be abused if leaked. The overall behavior resembles a system info exfiltration script rather than malicious malware, but the lack of user notification and explicit consent raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects detailed system information and sends it to an external service without user awareness or consent, which poses privacy risks. While no active malware or destructive actions are present, the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly before use. The static webhook URL further exacerbates the security concern.",
