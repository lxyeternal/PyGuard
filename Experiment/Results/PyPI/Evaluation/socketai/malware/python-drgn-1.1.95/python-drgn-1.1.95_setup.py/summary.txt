  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive data exfiltration during package installation, which is a serious security concern. It does not contain active malware payloads but performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information. The activity qualifies as malicious in intent, warranting high security risk and malware scores. The current scores underestimate the malicious potential; they should be adjusted upward to reflect the privacy invasion, with malware scores around 0.6-0.8 and security risk scores around 0.75-0.9."
