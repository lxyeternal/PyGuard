  "flows": "System info commands -> gathers data -> formats data -> sends data via POST request to Slack webhook",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional sending of system information (hostname, user, IPs, OS info, etc.) to external Slack URL without user consent, hardcoded Slack webhook URL, no validation or encryption of data, inclusion of potentially sensitive system info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, executes multiple system commands based on the platform to collect system details. It then constructs a payload containing this information and posts it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. The code runs regardless of user consent and transmits potentially sensitive data, which can be considered malicious or at least privacy-intrusive. The commands used are standard but their use in this context to exfiltrate system info indicates malicious intent or privacy abuse. No obfuscation is present, but the persistent and unconditional data exfiltration during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by collecting and sending detailed system information to an external service without user awareness or consent. This behavior constitutes a privacy violation and potentially malicious activity, especially as it occurs during installation. The code is not obfuscated, but the purposeful data collection and external transmission are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
