{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as hostname, user, IP addresses, OS details, and current directory, then sends this data unconditionally to a hardcoded Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": [
    "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'systeminfo', 'ifconfig', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'",
    "requests.get('http://ifconfig.me') for public IP",
    "os.getcwd() for current directory"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "requests.post() to the hardcoded Slack webhook with the collected data"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "System commands and requests gather data -> data is formatted into a JSON payload -> payload is sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Unconditional data exfiltration during package installation without user consent",
    "Use of hardcoded webhook URL",
    "No obfuscation or encryption of data",
    "Repeated collection of sensitive system info"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs unprompted collection of sensitive system information using standard system commands and requests. It then transmits this data to an external webhook without user knowledge or consent, constituting privacy-invasive exfiltration. The activity is consistent across all platforms, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. While it does not execute malicious code or payloads, the privacy breach is significant and could be exploited maliciously. The data flow is straightforward, with source data flowing directly into a network sink. The activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in the context of supply chain security, but lacks active malware components.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive data exfiltration during package installation, which is a serious security concern. It does not contain active malware payloads but performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information. The activity qualifies as malicious in intent, warranting high security risk and malware scores. The current scores underestimate the malicious potential; they should be adjusted upward to reflect the privacy invasion, with malware scores around 0.6-0.8 and security risk scores around 0.75-0.9.",
