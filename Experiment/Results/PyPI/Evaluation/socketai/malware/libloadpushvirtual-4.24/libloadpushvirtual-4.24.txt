      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, conditional execution of a PowerShell command during setup, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The silent error handling and embedded URL support malicious intent. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are high. The package should be considered unsafe without further decoding and analysis of the encoded command."
