  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command connecting to a suspicious URL. The package setup code is standard but likely used as a cover. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified based on the evidence. Immediate review and further decoding of the payload are recommended to confirm malicious intent."
