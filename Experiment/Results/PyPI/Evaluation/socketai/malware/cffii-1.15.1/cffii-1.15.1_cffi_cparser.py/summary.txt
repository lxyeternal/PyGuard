  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured C parser with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal threat level, primarily due to complex source modifications that could be misused if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the security posture is very low risk for malicious activity."
