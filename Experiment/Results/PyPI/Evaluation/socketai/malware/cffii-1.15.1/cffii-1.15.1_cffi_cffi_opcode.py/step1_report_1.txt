{
  "purpose": "Define classes, constants, and utility functions for handling CFFI operations and primitive type mappings in a Python extension or binding context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; the code primarily defines constants, mappings, and classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted data; no output or external data writing functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures and methods for formatting C expressions and converting data types, but does not include data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to representing CFFI operations, mapping primitive types, and defining constants. The class 'CffiOp' converts internal representations into C expressions and Python byte formats, with validation checks such as range enforcement. The functions and constants are static definitions related to C data types and operation codes, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious data handling. The absence of input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution suggests low risk. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for a Python extension system, with no embedded malicious code or indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility module defining constants, data mappings, and simple classes for CFFI operations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the security risk level is very low.",
