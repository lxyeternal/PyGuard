{
  "purpose": "Define classes, constants, and helper functions for handling CFFI operation codes and primitive types in a Python C extension context.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, string inputs, and constants for type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted input directly into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input strings (e.g., self.arg) are transformed into formatted bytes or expressions; no external or untrusted data flows into critical system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code mainly defines constants and formatting functions. The only noteworthy point is the verification that strings are digit-only before converting, which is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structure for handling CFFI operation codes and primitive type constants, with functions for formatting data and mapping types. It uses safe string formatting, defines constants explicitly, and has no external data processing or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured part of a C extension interface for Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module for handling CFFI operation codes and primitive types with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely definitional and formatting code with no external data flows or suspicious operations.",
