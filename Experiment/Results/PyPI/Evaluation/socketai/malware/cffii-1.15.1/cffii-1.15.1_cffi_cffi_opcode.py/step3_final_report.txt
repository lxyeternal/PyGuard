{
  "purpose": "Defines classes, constants, and utility functions for handling CFFI operations and primitive type mappings, primarily for code generation and data formatting.",
  "sources": "String inputs for operation types and arguments, internal constants, class attributes, and primitive type mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed, and no data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input strings or constants are validated and formatted into C expressions or byte sequences; no external data flows or dynamic code execution occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard validation and formatting functions are used without obfuscation or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, purpose-specific, and well-structured, serving as a utility module for CFFI operations and primitive type definitions. It performs input validation, string formatting, and constant mappings without external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The validation checks are standard and do not introduce risks. The code's design aligns with typical utility modules, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for CFFI operation representation and primitive type mapping. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified, and the overall security posture is very strong.",
