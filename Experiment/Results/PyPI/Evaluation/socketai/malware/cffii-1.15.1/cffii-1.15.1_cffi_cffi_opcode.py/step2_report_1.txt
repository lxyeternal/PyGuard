  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes, constants, and utility functions for handling CFFI operations and primitive types. The class `CffiOp` converts internal representations into C expressions and Python bytes, with validation such as overflow checks.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or suspicious patterns. The code is static, well-structured, and purpose-specific.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code with no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on data validation, string formatting, and type mappings. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Safe use of assertions and exception handling. No dynamic code execution or external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate given the benign, static code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate utility module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines classes and constants for CFFI operations and primitive types, with safe data transformations.\n- **Findings:** No external input processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Consistent with a safe utility module.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on code formatting and data representation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators, no dynamic code or external data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Defines classes and constants for CFFI operations, primarily for code generation.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Fully benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely utility functions and constants, no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity. The code is static, purpose-specific, and does not process untrusted input or perform any network or file operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, utility nature of the code, the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2). There are no indications of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is straightforward, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable, and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low; the code is a utility module defining constants and simple classes, with no external data handling or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Note:** The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-structured utility module for handling CFFI operations and primitive type mappings. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are justified, and the overall security posture is very strong.",
