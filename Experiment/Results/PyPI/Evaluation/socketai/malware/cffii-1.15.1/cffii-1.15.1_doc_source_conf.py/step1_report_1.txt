  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation with Sphinx for the CFFI project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os; variables set for Sphinx configuration; commented-out code; extension list; path modifications.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no code executing external commands or network operations; no credential handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. All code appears to serve legitimate configuration purposes. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports common modules but does not perform any runtime actions beyond setting configuration variables. All operations are static assignments with no external data input or output, no network activity, and no code execution beyond the initial import. The commented-out sections do not pose any threat. No anomalies, malicious logic, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply sets parameters for Sphinx without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
