  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the CFFI project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os), configuration variable definitions, commented-out code, and list assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no network communications, no file writes, no command executions observed.",
  "flows": "None detected; the code is purely configuration without data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic or malicious code execution. It imports standard modules, sets configuration variables, and contains no code that interacts with external inputs, performs network activity, or manipulates system resources beyond setting documentation parameters. There are no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. All code appears to be benign setup code for documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to define documentation build settings for the CFFI project.",
