  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex ctypes wrapper facilitating C interop. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is misuse of its powerful low-level functions with untrusted data, which is a common risk in such low-level FFI code. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
