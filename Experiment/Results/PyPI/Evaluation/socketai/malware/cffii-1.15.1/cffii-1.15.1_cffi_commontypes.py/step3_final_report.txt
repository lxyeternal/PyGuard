  "purpose": "Manage common C types for Python FFI, including platform-specific types, caching, and recursive resolution.",
  "sources": "Imports from _cffi_backend, model module, and platform-specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and platform checks lead to cached resolution and error handling within internal functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'set-unicode-needed' as a marker triggers exceptions if accessed prematurely; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type management module for a Python FFI library, handling common and platform-specific types with caching and recursive resolution. No suspicious data flows, external communications, or malicious patterns are present. The 'set-unicode-needed' markers are control flags for deferred Unicode handling, not malicious. Error handling and platform checks are appropriate and typical for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs typical type management tasks without any malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores are correctly assigned as malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
