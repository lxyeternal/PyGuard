  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, I note that all five reports contain \"Empty response\" with no details provided. This means I have no specific information about any issues, vulnerabilities, or concerns raised in these reports. Without concrete details, I cannot confirm the presence of issues, errors, or malicious activity.\n\nNext, I will evaluate the code snippet itself:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard setup script for building a Python extension module using distutils.\n- It imports configuration parameters from a local 'setup' module, which is typical.\n- The conditional logic involving `standard = '__pypy__' not in sys.builtin_module_names` and the subsequent use of `* standard` in the `ext_modules` list is a concise way to include the extension only if not running on PyPy. This is a common pattern and seems correct.\n- There are no obvious signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations beyond setup, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious.\n\nGiven the lack of details in the reports, I cannot identify any errors, flaws, or malicious activity based on the provided code.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, I would assign a malware score of **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; thus, the obfuscated score should be **0.0**.\n- **Risk score:** Without any reported issues or suspicious behavior, the risk score should be **0.0**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports are empty; no issues are reported.\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- Scores should reflect the absence of issues: malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0.\n\n**Final note:** If future reports contain details, I will reassess accordingly. For now, based on available information, the code and reports indicate no concern.",
