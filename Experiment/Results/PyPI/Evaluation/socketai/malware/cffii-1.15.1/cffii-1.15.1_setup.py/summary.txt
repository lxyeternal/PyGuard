  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, platform-aware build configuration script for cffi, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The potential risks are typical for build scripts, mainly environmental manipulation, which does not constitute malware. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and justified."
