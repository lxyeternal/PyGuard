      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly malicious behavior, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation to hide intent, and lack of validation, all during package installation. These characteristics strongly suggest it is malicious software intended for system compromise. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and reflect the severity of the threat."
