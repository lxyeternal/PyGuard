{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that performs custom actions during installation, including dynamic code retrieval and execution, based on platform-specific data and encoded URLs.",
  "sources": "The code reads local directory paths (BASE.glob), system platform information (platform.machine()), and external data via HTTP requests (requests.get). It also reads and encodes specific constants and file paths.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a binary file in the user's local bin directory and executes this binary via subprocess.Popen. It also writes a temporary empty file at '/tmp/testing'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local directory scanning and platform info to conditional URL generation, which fetches data from external servers. The fetched data is decoded and written as an executable binary, then executed, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated URL generation using XOR operations, dynamic code download and execution, creation of an executable file named 'donothing', and writing to a temporary file without purpose. The use of encrypted byte arrays and dynamic URL creation suggest obfuscation and possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defining several byte arrays with obfuscated data. It defines a generator function that produces a sequence based on SHA3 hashing. The CustomRun function dynamically generates URLs based on platform info and cryptographic operations, fetches content from these URLs, writes it as an executable file, and executes it. During installation, it scans directories matching 't*/*O*/*', hashes their paths, and compares with a hardcoded byte array. If matched, it runs the CustomRun function. The obfuscation of URL strings, dynamic external code retrieval, and execution of downloaded binaries are suspicious behaviors often associated with malware. The code also creates a temporary empty file without clear purpose, which may be a marker or an attempt to create side effects. Overall, the code shows clear signs of malicious intent, including remote code execution and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains obfuscated URL generation, dynamic external code download, and execution of fetched binaries, all of which are typical behaviors of malware. It appears designed to retrieve and execute potentially malicious payloads from remote servers during installation, based on system-specific conditions. The use of obfuscation, cryptographic operations, and runtime code execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
