  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution, hardcoded URLs, input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, eval/exec calls, file operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into dynamic code execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation (complex code, dynamic eval/exec), suspicious external URLs, environment variable usage, and possible data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code appears largely benign with standard imports and straightforward logic. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are evident in most cases. One report indicates signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external resource access, raising suspicion of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports align with the described behaviors: benign reports have malware and obfuscation scores near zero, while the suspicious report has higher scores (0.6) for both malware and obfuscation, and a moderate security risk (0.65). Confidence levels correspond to the clarity of the analysis. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; one report indicates potential malicious behavior justified by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The scoring system accurately reflects these observations. No further adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
