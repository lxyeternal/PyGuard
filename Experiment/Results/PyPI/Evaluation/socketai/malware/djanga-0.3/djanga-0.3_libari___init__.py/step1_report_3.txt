{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on its structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables and possibly external inputs (e.g., user input or file data).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or transmits data to network connections, file systems, or external services, especially where untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources to processing functions, then to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step: It begins with importing modules and reading environment variables; then processes data through functions. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as sending system data over the network, connecting to suspicious domains, or executing unauthorized actions. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No suspicious inline code, dynamic evaluation, or obfuscation detected. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to perform standard data processing with no suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
