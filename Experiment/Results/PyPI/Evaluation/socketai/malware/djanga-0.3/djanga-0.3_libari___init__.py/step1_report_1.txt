  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard package initialization and potentially some utility functions. No explicit purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly defined; there are no obvious data input functions, user prompts, or external data fetches.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls or file operations, but none are explicitly present or suspicious in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are observable; the code does not process untrusted input in a manner that leads to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are detected. No backdoors or suspicious functions appear present.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code mainly contains standard imports and function definitions with no evidence of data handling, external communications, or malicious constructs. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be benign and standard in nature.",
