{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be setting up a Python package named 'djanga' using setuptools, but it also includes code that downloads and executes remote content, which could be malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external server at IP 145.249.104.71 via HTTP requests using urllib2 or http.client.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded response is written directly to a file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, made executable, and then executed via a system call. Additionally, it appends a command to '~/.bashrc' to run '.drv' in the background.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the remote server (IP 145.249.104.71) through network request (source) to be written into the file '.drv' (sink), then executed via system call, with a command added to '~/.bashrc' for persistent execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of remote code without validation or authentication, modifying user's shell startup file to execute malicious code automatically, use of hardcoded IP and path, and execution of downloaded content as a system command. The function 'rn()' is invoked immediately during script import, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setuptools for package setup, then defines a function 'rn()' that performs network operations to download data from a specific IP address. It detects the platform, then fetches remote content over HTTP, writes it to a file '.drv' in the user's home directory, makes it executable, and appends a command to '~/.bashrc' to run this file in the background. The function is called immediately upon script execution. The setup() call proceeds to define a package but is likely secondary to the malicious code in 'rn()'. The remote code execution, persistence mechanism, and hardcoded IP suggest malicious intent. No validation of downloaded content is performed, and the code executes remote content directly, which is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and persisting remote code without validation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk. It functions as a backdoor or dropper, compromising system security.",
