  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; standard class inheritance and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation occurs when errors are raised during HTTP request processing.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised during network operations; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code primarily consists of class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling in a network request library. It imports standard exceptions and defines subclasses for various error conditions such as connection issues, timeouts, invalid URLs, and decoding errors. The class structures and inheritance are typical for exception handling. No code injection, malicious payloads, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code lacks any network activity or data leakage mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code appears to be standard, well-structured exception definitions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as error handling scaffolding without any malicious payloads or suspicious functionality.",
