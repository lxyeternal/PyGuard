  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- No suspicious code, malicious payloads, obfuscation, or external data handling are identified.\n- The code imports standard exceptions and defines subclasses for various error scenarios.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound; all conclude that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is purely class definitions with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code is safe, standard, and straightforward.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; no errors are evident.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign and typical for an exception module.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given the lack of vulnerabilities, 0 is justified.\n\n### Risk Score Justification:\n- The highest risk score should be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- A score of 0.5 would imply moderate concern, which is unjustified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- No changes needed; the code is a standard exception hierarchy with no security issues.\n- The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present. The reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
