  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n   - No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, or external data processing is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are high (1), reflecting the clear understanding of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes, with no malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on static analysis, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Personal Estimate (Post-Review):**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified.",
