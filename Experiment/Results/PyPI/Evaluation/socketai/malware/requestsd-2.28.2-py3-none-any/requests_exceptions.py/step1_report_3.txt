{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for the Requests library to handle different error scenarios during HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class initializers and attribute access within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily exception class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard exception class definitions for a well-known Python HTTP library. It imports exceptions from external modules and defines subclasses for various network and request errors. The constructors mainly initialize attributes and pass arguments to superclasses. No dynamic code execution, no data manipulation, and no embedded malicious code or backdoors are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign exception handling module for the Requests library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and functional within its intended purpose.",
