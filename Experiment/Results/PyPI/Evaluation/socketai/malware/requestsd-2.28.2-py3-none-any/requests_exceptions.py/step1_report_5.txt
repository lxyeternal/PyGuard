  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, mainly related to HTTP operations and data decoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data; it defines exception classes and imports from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply defines exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code contains only standard exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious behaviors. All imported modules are standard or local, and no code indicates malicious intent or backdoors. The structure and content suggest it is purely for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class module for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for normal error handling purposes.",
