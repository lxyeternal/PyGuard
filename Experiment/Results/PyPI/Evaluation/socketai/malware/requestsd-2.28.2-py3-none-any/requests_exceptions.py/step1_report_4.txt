{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and warnings for the requests library, handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external exceptions (`urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError`, `.compat.JSONDecodeError`) and internal class constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of exception handling and error propagation, but no direct untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Exceptions may be raised during HTTP request processing, but no flow involves untrusted input leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed. The class structures are standard exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception and warning class definitions for handling errors in the requests library. It imports external exceptions and defines custom subclasses for various HTTP and connection errors, as well as warning classes. There is no evidence of malicious code, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The constructors follow typical patterns for exception classes, and no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears purely structural and supportive of error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception and warning class definitions for the requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
