  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (urllib3.exceptions, .compat), class constructors, attribute checks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; primarily class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for the Requests library, importing necessary exceptions from standard libraries and local modules. All classes are straightforward, mainly serving as custom exception types. The constructors initialize attributes or pass arguments, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions for a Python HTTP request library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
