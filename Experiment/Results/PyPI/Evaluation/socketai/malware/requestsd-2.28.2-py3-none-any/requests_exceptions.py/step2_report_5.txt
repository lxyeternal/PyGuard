  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of standard exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes with straightforward inheritance and initialization. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are noted.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are zero, no justification is needed. The code does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly zero across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the actual code structure, imports, and class definitions, without assumptions about malicious intent. They are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses, which find no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Overall Evaluation**:  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
