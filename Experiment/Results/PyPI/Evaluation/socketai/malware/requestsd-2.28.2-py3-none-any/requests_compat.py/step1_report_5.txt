{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and import resolution for different Python versions and handle dependencies like chardet and simplejson.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing, network communication, or data output occurring.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources flow into any sensitive functions or modules. Import resolution is static and does not handle external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code contains typical compatibility handling with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility across Python 2 and 3, imports necessary modules with fallback mechanisms, and defines some type aliases. It uses standard, well-known modules and patterns without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. The import fallback from 'chardet' to 'charset_normalizer' is standard for maintaining compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility and import resolution code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and the security risk score is very low.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
