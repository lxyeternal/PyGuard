{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and manages imports for various dependencies used in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system environment (via sys.version_info), and attempts to import modules such as chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or handling of untrusted data sources within this fragment.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules based on availability, determining Python version, and aliasing types for compatibility; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is clear: compatibility and import management. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports for compatibility across Python versions and optional dependencies. It conditionally imports modules like chardet and simplejson, sets version flags, and defines compatibility types. No external data is read from untrusted sources or used in a way that could introduce security risks. The code is standard for a compatibility layer, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility module that manages imports and type definitions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malware signals are detected.",
