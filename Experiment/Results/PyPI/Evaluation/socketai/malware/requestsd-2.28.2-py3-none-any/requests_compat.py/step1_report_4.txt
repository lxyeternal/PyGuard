{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling and imports for various Python versions and dependencies, specifically for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), conditional import of chardet, simplejson, and json modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation; no external data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up environment compatibility, imports modules, and defines some utility variables. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward compatibility setup.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports external dependencies like chardet and simplejson, handles Python 2/3 compatibility, and sets up module imports. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, or suspicious patterns. All operations are standard for compatibility modules. There is no code that interacts with external data, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
