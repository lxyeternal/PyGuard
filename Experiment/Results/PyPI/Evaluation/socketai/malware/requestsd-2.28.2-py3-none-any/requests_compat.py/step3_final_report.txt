  "purpose": "Compatibility boilerplate managing imports and version flags for Python 2 and 3, with fallback dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info checks, fallback import logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static import setup without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback import for 'chardet' to 'charset_normalizer' is standard; no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling compatibility issues with conditional imports and version detection. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity is present. The fallback import pattern is common and not malicious. No obfuscation or secrets are evident. The code's purpose is purely environment setup, with no signs of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard compatibility boilerplate, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is marginal and can be considered a conservative overestimation due to the fallback import pattern, but overall, the code remains safe.",
