{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling import differences between Python 2 and Python 3, mainly for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, chardet (optional), collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code mainly handles imports and defines compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are used; flow is limited to importing modules and defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code adheres to standard compatibility practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages import statements, handles optional dependencies, and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3. It uses try-except blocks to import optional modules without executing any untrusted code or executing dangerous operations. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim for Python 2/3, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply manages imports and defines constants for backward compatibility.",
