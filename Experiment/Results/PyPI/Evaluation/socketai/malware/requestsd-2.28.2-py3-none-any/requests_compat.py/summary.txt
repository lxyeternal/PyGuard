  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard compatibility boilerplate, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is marginal and can be considered a conservative overestimation due to the fallback import pattern, but overall, the code remains safe."
