  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning provided, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely compatibility boilerplate, managing imports and version flags, with no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code matches the description. No untrusted data, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, and the report's confidence is high. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing import management and compatibility.\n- **Assessment:** The code aligns with this description. No data flows or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 are justified.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, and the report's confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility handling, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No dynamic execution or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and import management, no data leaks or external data processing.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 fit the code.\n- **Justification:** No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility code, with a note on the fallback from 'chardet' to 'charset_normalizer'.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is standard; the fallback is a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1\n- **Issue:** The report assigns a slightly higher security risk (0.1) despite no evidence of external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The only point of concern might be the fallback import, but this is a common compatibility pattern, not a security risk. No obfuscation or malware signals are present.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is standard compatibility boilerplate.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are mostly zero, with Report 5's 0.1 slightly overstated given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are all justified as zero.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are justified as zero.\n- The **security risk scores** should remain at zero for all reports, including Report 5, as there's no evidence of security issues or malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard compatibility code, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores in the reports are consistent with the actual code content.",
