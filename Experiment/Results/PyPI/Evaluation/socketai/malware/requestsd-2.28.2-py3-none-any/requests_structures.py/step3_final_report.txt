  "purpose": "Data structures that manage case-insensitive headers and lookup dictionaries, primarily for HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read during object initialization, key setting, and key retrieval operations within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data remains within in-memory structures, with no network, file, or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal dictionaries during updates and key assignments; retrievals access internal stores without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; use of __dict__ and internal data structures is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward, well-understood data structures for case-insensitive header management and lookup. It does not perform any network activity, code execution, or system modifications. The internal data manipulations are typical for such utility classes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The only minor concern is the potential for external manipulation of internal dictionaries, but this is inherent to mutable data structures and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for use within the Requests library. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score (around 0) is appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; a score of 0 is more accurate.",
