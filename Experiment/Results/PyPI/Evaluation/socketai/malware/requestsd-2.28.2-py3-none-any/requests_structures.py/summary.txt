  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for use within the Requests library. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The low security risk score (around 0) is appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; a score of 0 is more accurate."
