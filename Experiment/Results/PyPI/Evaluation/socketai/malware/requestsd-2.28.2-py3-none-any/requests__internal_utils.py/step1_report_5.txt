{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling HTTP headers and string conversions within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (`re`, `compat`) and from the `string` parameter in `to_native_string` and `unicode_is_ascii` functions.",
  "sinks": "The `to_native_string` function decodes external input strings, and `unicode_is_ascii` checks properties of provided unicode strings; no direct data leakage or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through `to_native_string` (which decodes external data) and `unicode_is_ascii` (which checks string content). The data flow is internal and controlled, with no untrusted data being directly sent to external sinks such as network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard string and regex operations; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior is present. The regex patterns are for header validation and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex validators for HTTP header names and values, uses a helper function to convert input to a native string, and checks if a unicode string contains only ASCII characters. All operations are straightforward string manipulations with no external system impact or suspicious logic. No backdoors, malicious payloads, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for header validation and string handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and unrelated to supply chain attacks.",
