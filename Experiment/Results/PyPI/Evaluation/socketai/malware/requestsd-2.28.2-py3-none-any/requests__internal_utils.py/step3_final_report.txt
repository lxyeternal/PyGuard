  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal header validation and string handling within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Header name and value regex patterns, input parameters of functions (strings, bytes), internal regex validation.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate internally without external data flow or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or str) flows into functions like to_native_string and unicode_is_ascii, with no external sinks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard regex patterns, straightforward string conversions, and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides regex-based validation for HTTP headers and utility functions for string conversion and ASCII checks. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications, nor does it include dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The functions are safe, standard, and internally used within the Requests library. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The regex patterns and functions are typical for header validation and string handling. The decoding in to_native_string assumes ASCII, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is benign with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for header validation and string handling, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
