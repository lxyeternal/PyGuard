  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines regex patterns for validating HTTP header names and values.\n- Provides `to_native_string()` to convert various string types to native strings, assuming ASCII encoding.\n- Provides `unicode_is_ascii()` to check if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters.\n- Uses only standard libraries (`re`) and an internal `compat` module.\n- Functions are straightforward, with no external data flow, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code performs standard validation and string handling.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malware patterns.\n- No external data leaks or insecure operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**All reports correctly identify this code as benign utility functions.** There are no issues to be found in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All reports correctly identify the purpose as internal utility functions for header validation and string processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data leaks are present; data flows are internal and controlled.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation. The regex patterns are standard, and functions are straightforward.\n- **Conclusions:** All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0, with some reports giving 0.1, citing minor uncertainties. Given the code's nature, 0.1 seems slightly high but still minimal.\n- **Confidence:** High (1.0 or 0.9), which is appropriate.\n\n### Any discrepancies?\n- The slight variation in `securityRisk` scores (0.1 vs 0) is acceptable, given the minor uncertainty about potential misuse, but overall, the code is very safe.\n- No report suggests any vulnerability or malicious behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to standard regex and string handling, no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n### My expert estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is a benign utility module, standard for internal use, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such utility functions are not misused elsewhere in the codebase, but based solely on this snippet, there is no security concern.",
