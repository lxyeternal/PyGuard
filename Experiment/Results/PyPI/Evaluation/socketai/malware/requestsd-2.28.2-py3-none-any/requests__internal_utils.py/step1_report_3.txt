{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the 'requests' library, mainly for header validation and string encoding handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'string' parameter for 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'. External data can come from network requests or other modules passing strings.",
  "sinks": "The functions process input data to produce normalized strings; no external sinks or data leaks are evident. No data is sent or stored externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated and converted internally without external interactions or data flows to other systems. 'to_native_string' decodes byte strings; 'unicode_is_ascii' checks string content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears standard, with straightforward regex validation and string conversion functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and functions for string conversion and ASCII checks. The regex patterns are static, compiled at load time, and used solely for validation. 'to_native_string' decodes bytes to strings, defaulting to ASCII, which is standard. 'unicode_is_ascii' checks for ASCII-only content. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leaks. No network activity, file access, or system modifications are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for internal use within the 'requests' library. It performs validation and string handling safely, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
