{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for handling HTTP headers and string conversions within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads string data from function inputs, such as 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to have any sinks that lead to data leaks or harmful effects. It mainly processes and validates string data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into regex validation or string encoding/decoding functions without external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard regex patterns and string operations. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and functions for string encoding/decoding. The regex patterns are standard for header validation, with no malicious intent. 'to_native_string' safely converts input to native string, assuming ASCII by default. 'unicode_is_ascii' checks ASCII compliance with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely utility functions for string handling and header validation within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
