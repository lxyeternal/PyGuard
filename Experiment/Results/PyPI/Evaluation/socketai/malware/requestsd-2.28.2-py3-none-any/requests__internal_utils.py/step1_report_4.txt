{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, specifically for header validation and string conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads header name and value strings, as well as input strings for conversion and ASCII checks.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks present. The functions handle string validation and conversion internally without transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated and converted; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The regex patterns are standard for header validation. The string handling appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for HTTP header validation, utility functions for converting strings to native types, and for checking ASCII content. No external network or system modifications occur. The functions perform straightforward validation and conversions without malicious intent or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for internal use within the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
