  "anomalies": [
    "Multiple exec calls with base64-encoded strings executing code, which is unusual and suspicious",

    "Base64 strings decode to code that appears to import modules and assign variables, but exact behavior is obscured",
    "Use of exec with encoded data to execute potentially hidden code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for the requests library, including dependency validation, SSL fallback, and logging configuration. However, it contains multiple base64-encoded exec statements that decode and execute code dynamically, which is atypical for normal library initialization and poses security risks. These exec calls could be used to hide malicious or unauthorized code execution. The decoded content appears to import modules and assign variables, but the precise behavior is obscured. The rest of the code seems standard, with version checks and warning configurations, but the presence of encoded dynamic execution is a red flag.",
  "conclusion": "While the initial setup appears legitimate, the use of multiple base64-encoded exec calls to run decoded code is suspicious and potentially malicious. This pattern is often used to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The code should be further inspected to decode and analyze the exact content of these exec statements. Overall, the structure raises concerns about covert behavior embedded within otherwise standard library initialization code.",
