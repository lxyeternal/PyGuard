  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard package metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains metadata assignments for a Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, copyright, and a decorative emoji. No input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic execution is present. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code structures. The content appears typical for a package's __init__.py or metadata definition file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as package metadata for the 'requests' library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
