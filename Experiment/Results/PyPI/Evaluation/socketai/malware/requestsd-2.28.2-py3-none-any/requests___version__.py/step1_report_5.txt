  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or output; purely static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is simple metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static strings and constants to module-level variables that describe the package metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external network calls, or code execution logic. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The variables are straightforward string literals, and the metadata is consistent with typical Python package info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to declare package metadata information. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
