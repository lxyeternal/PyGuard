  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Static assignments of package metadata; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments containing package metadata, with no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard header or metadata section typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module description. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The code is simple, static, and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static metadata definitions for a well-known Python package ('requests') and poses no security threats or malicious behavior. It is standard package information setup.",
