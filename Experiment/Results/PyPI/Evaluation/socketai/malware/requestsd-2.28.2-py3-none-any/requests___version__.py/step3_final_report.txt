  "purpose": "Static metadata definitions for the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, license, and descriptive information.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments containing package metadata; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignments without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art and emojis are present but benign; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no dynamic data reads, network calls, code execution, or obfuscation. The comments and ASCII art are decorative and do not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
