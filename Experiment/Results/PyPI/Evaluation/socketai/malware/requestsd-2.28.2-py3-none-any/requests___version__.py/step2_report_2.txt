  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is purely static metadata assignments for the 'requests' package.\n- No dynamic code, external data input, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- **Confirmed:** The code contains only variable assignments for package metadata. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **No malicious code, no external data, no dynamic execution.**\n\n#### **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as static metadata.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n\n#### **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n#### **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n#### **Malware score considerations:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- All reports agree on this.\n\n#### **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- No report claims any suspicious behavior based on assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n#### **Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate for the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Score | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**               | No malicious activity or code present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**               | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk    | **0**               | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.             |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is purely static metadata for the 'requests' package.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.",
