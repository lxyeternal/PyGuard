  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "None; all lines are variable assignments with static string and numeric values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides package metadata, which is common and benign. It only assigns static values to variables describing the package. No input handling, no external data access, and no code execution are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is standard package metadata with no malicious intent. It poses no security risks and is typical for open-source Python packages.",
