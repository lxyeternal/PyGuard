  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of metadata variables; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual characters in comments (emojis, ASCII art) are decorative but do not affect security.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable definitions for the 'requests' library, including version, author, license, and description. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The comments are decorative ASCII art and emojis, which do not introduce security concerns. The code appears to be part of a package's metadata and contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for the 'requests' package and contains no malicious or security risk behavior. It does not perform any operations beyond static variable assignments. The presence of decorative comments does not impact security.",
