While the actual content of these payloads is unknown, the pattern suggests high malicious potential. The assigned scores reflect this high suspicion, and caution is advised until further decoding and analysis are performed."

The low security risk score (around 0) is appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; a score of 0 is more accurate."
