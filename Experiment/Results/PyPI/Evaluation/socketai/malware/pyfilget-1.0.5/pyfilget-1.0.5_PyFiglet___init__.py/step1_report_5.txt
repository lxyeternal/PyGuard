  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a generic Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its exact purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input functions, and possibly reads environment variables or external files if present (though none are shown here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network connections (if present), or file writes (if present), which are not evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input or environment variables) to processing functions, and potentially to output functions such as printing or saving to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic data processing or utility functions without external library misuse or suspicious patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or secret exfiltration. No obfuscation or encrypted code present. The code structure is simple and standard.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
