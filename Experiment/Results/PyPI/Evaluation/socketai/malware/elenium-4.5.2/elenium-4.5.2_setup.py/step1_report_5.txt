{
  "purpose": "The script installs a Python package and executes a post-installation routine that sends system information and downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', making HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and executing a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute the downloaded executable file, which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sends data to external server via requests.get() -> Downloads executable file from external URL -> Executes downloaded file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. Downloading and executing a file from untrusted sources without validation. Dynamic execution of external code and reliance on environment variables for identification. The URL domains seem suspicious and unrelated to legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send() function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to an external server, then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent, as it collects system information and runs external code without user consent. The use of broad exception handling and lack of validation further suggest malicious or unwanted activity. The overall pattern resembles common supply chain attacks involving stealthy data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information, contacting external servers, downloading, and executing arbitrary files. It appears designed to surreptitiously compromise systems, indicating a high security risk.",
