{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'elenium' with a post-installation step that executes potentially malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs in the 'send' function, and the 'os.system' call executing downloaded content.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call that fetches external scripts and the 'os.system' command that executes a downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and URL parameters are sent via GET request, and a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed via 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'try-except' block with broad exception handling, dynamic download and execution of an executable from a non-standard URL, hardcoded URL strings, and environment variable-based data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and installation modules, along with 'requests' for HTTP operations. The 'send' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and executes it using 'os.system'. The 'PostInstallCommand' class ensures 'send' executes after installation. The setup configuration defines package details but includes a custom post-install step that performs network communication and file execution. These behaviors resemble malicious activity, such as data exfiltration and remote code execution. The code appears designed to secretly fetch and run malicious payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and downloading/executing a potentially harmful payload during installation. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
