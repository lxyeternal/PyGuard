{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'elenium' with some installation hooks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system().",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is included in a request URL; if on Windows, downloads an executable and runs it, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function retrieves environment info and then downloads and executes an external executable without any validation or user consent. Use of 'os.system' to run downloaded content is suspicious. The 'requests' module is imported but not declared as a dependency, which is unusual. The setup configuration includes an empty 'install_requires' list.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that, upon execution, reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends a GET request to a suspicious URL containing this info. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') and immediately runs it via 'os.system'. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the install process to invoke 'send', meaning this malicious behavior triggers during package installation. The setup configuration appears standard but includes potential malicious behavior embedded in the post-install hook. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to execute malicious code upon package installation. No obfuscation is evident; the malicious code is relatively straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes embedded malicious behavior in its post-installation process, downloading and executing a remote executable, which indicates a supply chain security attack. It is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
