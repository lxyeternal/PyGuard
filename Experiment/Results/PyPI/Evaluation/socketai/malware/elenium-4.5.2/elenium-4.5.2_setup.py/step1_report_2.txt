{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded malicious function to send data and download an executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and the 'requests.get' call to a suspicious URL; the 'os.system' call to execute a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'os.system'; data exfiltration through the 'requests.get' request with environment info.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read -> data sent to 'linkedopports.com' -> executable downloaded from 'python-release.com' -> executed via 'os.system'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to identify machine; fetching and executing a potentially malicious executable during setup; try-except block suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but also imports 'requests' and overrides the 'install' command to execute a 'send' function during installation. The 'send' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL, then downloads and executes an executable from an untrusted source. The URL endpoints and behavior indicate potential data exfiltration and malicious activity. The code suppresses errors, which could hide failures or detection attempts. This behavior is suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including sending system info to an external server, downloading, and executing a potentially harmful file during installation. This setup script is highly suspicious and potentially malware.",
