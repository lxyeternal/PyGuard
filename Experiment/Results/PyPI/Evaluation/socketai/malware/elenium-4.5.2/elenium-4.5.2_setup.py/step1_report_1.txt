{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package installation process that includes a custom post-install step to send data and potentially download and execute an external file.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'] (system environment variable), requests.get (external URL requests), open(filename, 'wb').write (downloading and writing a file), os.system (executing downloaded file)",
  "sinks": "requests.get (to retrieve external payloads), open(filename, 'wb').write (saving payloads), os.system('start '+filename) (executing downloaded payload)",
  "flows": "send() function reads environment variable and makes requests, downloads a file, then executes it; run() triggers send() during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling with 'except: pass', which suppresses errors and hides potential malicious activity; downloads and executes an external file without validation; hardcoded URL and filename; potentially exploits environment variables for identification",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send() function that retrieves the COMPUTERNAME environment variable, makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, and if on Windows, downloads an executable file from a seemingly malicious URL and executes it. The custom PostInstallCommand runs send() after installation. The setup function integrates this custom command. The code exhibits typical indicators of malicious activity: downloading and executing external payloads, using environment variables to personalize requests, and suppressing errors to avoid detection. The use of broad exception handling could conceal failures or malicious actions. Overall, the code appears designed to exfiltrate data and install malicious payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it stealthily downloads and executes a remote executable, sends environment info to an external server, and suppresses errors to hide activity. This indicates high malicious intent and security risk, and the package should not be used.",
