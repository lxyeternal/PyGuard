  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or environment variables; static code with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static execution of print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints a static message 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no external inputs, no data flows, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is trivial, benign, and straightforward, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1.0 in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately score the code as safe. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
