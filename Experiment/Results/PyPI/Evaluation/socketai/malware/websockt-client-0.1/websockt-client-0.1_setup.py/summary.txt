  "conclusion": "The script exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent, including heavy obfuscation, system modifications, privilege checks, and covert package management. The high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further dynamic analysis and sandbox testing before deployment."
