  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for general use, with no explicit purpose indicated.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading environment variables, input functions, or external libraries, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but the code does not contain any obvious operations in these areas.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed; the code does not demonstrate any source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated patterns, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provided is either empty or contains only standard Python syntax without any external or suspicious behaviors. No input/output operations, network calls, or security-sensitive functions are identified. Due to the lack of complex or suspicious constructs, no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
