  "purpose": "The code appears to serve general data processing or minimal functionality without suspicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly identified; the code does not read external inputs or data streams in the provided snippets.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident; no network connections, file writes, or environment variable accesses are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are straightforward and internal; no source-to-sink paths indicating malicious data exfiltration or injection are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns are detected; code is either trivial or incomplete, with no obfuscation indicators.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are either benign, trivial, or incomplete, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Confidence in benignity is high (0.9) for complete snippets, moderate (0.5) for incomplete code. Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature of the code. The assessments are appropriate and align with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary. The overall security posture based on these snippets is low risk.",
