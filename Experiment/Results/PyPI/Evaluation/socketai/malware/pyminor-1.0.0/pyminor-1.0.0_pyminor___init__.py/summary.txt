  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally consistent and appropriately score the risk levels based on the code patterns described. Report 2's high suspicion is justified, and other reports reflect low to moderate concern. The scores accurately represent the analyzed behaviors, with no evidence of confirmed malicious activity. Slight adjustments could be made to emphasize the suspicion in some cases, but current scores are reasonable."
