      "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation and executes dynamically decrypted code during installation, strongly indicating malicious intent. It should be considered malicious, and its use should be avoided. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."

Report 2's high suspicion is justified, and other reports reflect low to moderate concern. The scores accurately represent the analyzed behaviors, with no evidence of confirmed malicious activity. Slight adjustments could be made to emphasize the suspicion in some cases, but current scores are reasonable."
