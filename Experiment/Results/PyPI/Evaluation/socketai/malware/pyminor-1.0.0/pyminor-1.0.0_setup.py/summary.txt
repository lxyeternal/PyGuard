  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation and executes dynamically decrypted code during installation, strongly indicating malicious intent. It should be considered malicious, and its use should be avoided. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
