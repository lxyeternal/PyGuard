  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyminor' with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' (containing digits).",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) call which executes dynamically deobfuscated code.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded by XOR with a repeated key string, then executed via eval after compilation, creating a source-to-sink flow from hardcoded obfuscated data to execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, XOR deobfuscation, and dynamic execution via eval/compile, which are typical indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. The string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' appears to be intentionally obfuscated, and the code within eval is hidden until runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install command that, during installation, attempts to decode an obfuscated string via XOR with a key string of digits. This decoded string is then compiled and executed dynamically, which could contain malicious payloads. The decoding process involves a large hardcoded string and a key derived from digits, which is a common obfuscation technique. No other malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or credential access is visible. The code appears designed to conceal potentially malicious code that executes at install time, which is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicates likely malicious intent. The use of XOR decoding and eval/compile strongly suggests hidden payload execution, constituting a security threat.",
