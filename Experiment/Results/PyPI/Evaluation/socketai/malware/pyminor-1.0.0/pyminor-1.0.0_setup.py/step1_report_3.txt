{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'pyminor' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads a large obfuscated string and a numeric string, then performs decoding via XOR, within the custom InstallCommand class's run method.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code from the obfuscated string is evaluated using eval(compile()), which executes dynamic code that can perform any actions, including malicious ones.",
  "flows": "The source is the obfuscated string and the numeric string; the flow decodes the string via XOR with a repeating key, then executes the resulting code dynamically via eval(compile()), which is the sink.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution with eval(compile()), and a long, non-plaintext string suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The code intentionally hides its behavior and executes decoded code at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a custom InstallCommand class that overrides the run method. Inside run, it attempts to decode an obfuscated string using XOR with a key derived from a large numeric string. The decoded string is then executed via eval(compile()), a dangerous pattern often used to conceal malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage, especially considering the code's effort to hide its true actions. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the critical part involving decoding and executing the obfuscated string is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that is dynamically decoded and executed, indicating malicious intent. It likely executes hidden malicious code during installation. This code should be considered high risk and unsafe for use.",
