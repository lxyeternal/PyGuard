  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a simple script that performs a mathematical calculation and prints the result.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data using the print() function; no data leaks or external connections are made.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code runs static calculations internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the math module, performs a calculation with a variable, and prints the result. No external data is read, and no sensitive information is accessed or transmitted. The code's structure is simple, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic calculation and outputting the result without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
