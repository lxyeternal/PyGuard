  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments reading environment variables, network connections, input data, or executing dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious indicators but exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are confirmed. The code structure appears standard with no evident backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The suspicion arises primarily from obfuscation and network patterns, but without concrete code snippets, certainty is limited. The overall behavior suggests cautious review rather than confirmed malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the dependency shows no definitive malicious behavior but contains obfuscation and suspicious network activity that warrant attention. The scores assigned are consistent with the described behaviors, with high malware and obfuscation scores justified if the described traits are confirmed. For code lacking such traits, scores should be lower. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
