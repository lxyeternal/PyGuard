      "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the dependency shows no definitive malicious behavior but contains obfuscation and suspicious network activity that warrant attention. The scores assigned are consistent with the described behaviors, with high malware and obfuscation scores justified if the described traits are confirmed. For code lacking such traits, scores should be lower. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, and no significant adjustments are necessary."
