  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious intent such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The setup code appears benign, but the hidden payload and obfuscation pose a significant security threat. Scores of malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and risk (0.85) are justified given the evidence."
