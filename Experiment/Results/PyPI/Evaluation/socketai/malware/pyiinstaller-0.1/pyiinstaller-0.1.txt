      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and system interaction indicative of malicious activity. It performs privileged operations, system modifications, and package installations covertly. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.8, obfuscation: ~0.9, security risk: ~0.85) are justified. It should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, warranting further dynamic analysis and cautious handling."
