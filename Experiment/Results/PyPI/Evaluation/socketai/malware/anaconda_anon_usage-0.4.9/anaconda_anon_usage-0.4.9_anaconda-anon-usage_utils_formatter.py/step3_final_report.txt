  "purpose": "This code is designed to format Python source files by removing trailing whitespace, ensuring a newline at the end, and replacing tabs with spaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a file specified by 'file_path' and from a sample code string within the main block.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the formatted code back to the same file; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or strings, processed through string manipulations, and written back to files.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'if not code ends with '\\n':' contains a syntax error; it should be 'if not code.endswith('\\n'):'; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic code formatting tasks with straightforward string operations. The main issue is a syntax error in the 'endswith' check, which would prevent execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports are empty and do not provide additional insights. The code is benign and intended for formatting, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple formatting utility with a syntax error that needs correction. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The primary concern is fixing the syntax bug to ensure proper functionality. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
