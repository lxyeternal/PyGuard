  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing an internal module during installation without safeguards is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores of approximately 0.75 for malware and security risk are justified, assuming the module could contain harmful code. This pattern should be flagged for further review or avoided unless the module's safety is verified."
