  "purpose": "Collects system information, call stack, and package context for telemetry or debugging purposes, then transmits this data to an external URL.",
  "sources": "System info (platform.system(), time since boot, hostname), call stack via traceback.extract_stack(), package/module name (__name__), and import context via traceback.extract_stack().",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending JSON data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, call stack, context) is assembled into a JSON object and sent directly via HTTP POST to the external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and transmission without user consent; no obfuscation or malicious payloads; call stack extraction for fingerprinting; use of a testing webhook URL.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign data collection primarily for analytics or debugging. It gathers environment and call context information and transmits it silently to an external endpoint. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The call stack extraction could be used for fingerprinting, but this is not inherently malicious. The transmission occurs unconditionally, raising privacy concerns but not malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately low (0), as no malicious actions are detected. The security risk score reflects privacy invasion rather than active exploitation, with a moderate level (around 0.2-0.3). Overall, the code is clear, benign, but privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily intended for telemetry or debugging, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. Its main concern is privacy invasion due to unsolicited data transmission. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscation 0, and the security risk around 0.2-0.3. The behavior warrants transparency and user consent to mitigate privacy issues.",
