  "purpose": "Minimal __init__.py file serving as a package marker with only a comment.",
  "sources": "No data reads, writes, or input sources; only a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, comment-only __init__.py file with no executable statements or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving solely as a package marker. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
