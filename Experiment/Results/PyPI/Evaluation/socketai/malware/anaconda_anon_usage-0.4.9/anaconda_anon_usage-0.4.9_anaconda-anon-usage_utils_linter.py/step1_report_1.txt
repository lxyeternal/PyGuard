{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple linter that checks for trailing whitespace and whether a file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of a specified Python file ('sample_file.py') when run.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> analyzes for whitespace issues -> outputs linting results; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all operations are standard file I/O and regex checks. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic static analysis on a Python source file to identify trailing whitespace and missing final newline. It reads a file from disk, processes its content with regex, and prints reports. All functions are straightforward and standard. No external inputs besides reading from a file; no code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward linter script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs static code style checks without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
