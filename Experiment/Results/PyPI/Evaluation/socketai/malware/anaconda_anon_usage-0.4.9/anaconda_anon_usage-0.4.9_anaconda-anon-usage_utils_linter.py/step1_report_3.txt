{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script that performs basic linting tasks on a specified file, checking for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "The code reads the entire content of a file specified by 'file_path' using open() and read() functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results via print() statements, but there are no sinks that process untrusted data for execution, storage, or transmission.",
  "flows": "Input: Reading file content with open() and read(); Output: Printing linting results via print(). No untrusted data flows from source to sink that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The script performs basic file I/O and string pattern checks without any malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to check for trailing whitespace and missing newline at the end of a file, then applies these checks to a sample code snippet saved to 'sample_file.py'. The logic is straightforward and intended for code style enforcement. No external network calls, no code execution, no handling of untrusted inputs beyond file reading, and no suspicious operations are present. The code is purely for code quality purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic static analysis for code style issues without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and purely for linting purposes.",
