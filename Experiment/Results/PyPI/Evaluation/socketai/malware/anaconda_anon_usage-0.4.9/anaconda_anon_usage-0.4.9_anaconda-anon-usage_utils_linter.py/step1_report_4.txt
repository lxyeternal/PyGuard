{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform basic linting on Python files by checking for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "Reads the entire content of the specified Python file ('file_path') when 'run_linter' is called.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input from reading the file flows through the functions to produce linting reports; no untrusted data flows to critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs straightforward string and file operations with no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no unusual logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Python file, checks for trailing whitespace and whether it ends with a newline, and reports these issues. It includes simple regex-based line inspection and file I/O. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. It is a basic linter utility with no external network calls, credential handling, or code execution beyond reading and string processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for code quality checks with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple static analysis without any harmful behavior or vulnerabilities.",
