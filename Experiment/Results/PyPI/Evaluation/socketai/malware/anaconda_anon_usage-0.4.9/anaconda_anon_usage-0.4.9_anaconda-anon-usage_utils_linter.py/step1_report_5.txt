{
  "purpose": "The code implements a basic Python linter to detect trailing whitespace and missing newline at the end of a file.",
  "sources": "Reading from a specified file path to load code content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write or send untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code reads the file content, analyzes it for specific formatting issues, and reports findings; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and performs simple static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a file, checks for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline. It uses regex for pattern matching and simple string methods for file analysis. The functions and flow are clear and purpose-specific. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The code is a benign utility script intended for code quality checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python linting utility for formatting issues. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
