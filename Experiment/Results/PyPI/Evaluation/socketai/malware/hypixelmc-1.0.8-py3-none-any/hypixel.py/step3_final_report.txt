{
  "purpose": "The code fetches a UUID from the Mojang API based on a username and attempts to install and import a package from a remote Git repository if not already installed.",
  "sources": "Requests to Mojang API; subprocess call to run 'pip install' from a remote Git URL; dynamic import of the package.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess command executes code from an external source; importlib.import_module may load malicious code if the package is compromised.",
  "flows": "get_uuid retrieves data from Mojang API; install_package runs 'pip install' from a remote URL; import_or_install_package checks for package presence and imports it, potentially executing malicious code during installation or import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run 'pip install' directly from a remote Git URL without validation; hardcoded repository URL; dynamic import without validation; no checksum or verification of the package.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a request to Mojang API, which is benign. However, it then executes 'pip install' via subprocess from a remote Git URL without any validation or checksum, which can execute malicious code if the repository is compromised. The dynamic import relies on the package being correctly installed, but the installation process itself is risky. The code lacks validation, verification, or sandboxing, making it vulnerable to supply chain attacks. The malware risk is high because malicious payloads could be executed during installation or import. The obfuscation score is zero; the code is straightforward. The security risk is significant due to untrusted external code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is executing untrusted code during package installation from a remote Git repository without validation, posing a high risk of malicious payload execution. The current scores underestimate this risk; a malware score of approximately 0.7 and a security risk score of about 0.8 are justified.",
