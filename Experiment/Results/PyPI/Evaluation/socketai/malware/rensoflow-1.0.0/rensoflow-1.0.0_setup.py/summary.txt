  "conclusion": "The setup script executes decrypted code during installation on Windows, which is a classic malicious pattern. The encrypted payload and obfuscation indicate malicious intent. Given the high potential for remote code execution and system compromise, the package should be flagged as malicious. The malware score is set to 1.0, obfuscated score around 0.8-0.9, and security risk at 1.0. Users should avoid installing this package, and developers should refrain from such practices."
