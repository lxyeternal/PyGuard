  "purpose": "Detects malicious code execution during package setup via obfuscated PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, execute encoded PowerShell command silently.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution, broad exception handling, suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The command is encoded, runs silently, and is triggered without validation, indicating malicious intent. The broad exception handling may conceal errors or malicious failures. The presence of a suspicious URL comment further raises concern. Multiple reports correctly identify these patterns, assigning high suspicion scores consistent with malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious or backdoor activity, specifically executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload during installation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified given the evidence. Immediate further analysis of the encoded command is recommended before use.",
