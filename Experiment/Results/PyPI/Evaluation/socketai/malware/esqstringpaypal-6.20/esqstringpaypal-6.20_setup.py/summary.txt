  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk indicators: obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state, typical of malware or backdoor delivery. The setup code appears benign but is likely exploited as a delivery vector. The high scores across reports are justified; the overall assessment is that this package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
