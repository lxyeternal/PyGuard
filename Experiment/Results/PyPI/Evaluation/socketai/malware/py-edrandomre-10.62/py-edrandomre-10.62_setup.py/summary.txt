  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior through obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload during package installation. The embedded URL and error suppression further support malicious intent. The scores are justified and should be maintained or increased to reflect severity."
