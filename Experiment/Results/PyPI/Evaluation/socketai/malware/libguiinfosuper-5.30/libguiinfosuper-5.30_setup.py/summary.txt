  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, with external URL indicators and stealthy behavior, strongly suggesting malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated with caution until further decoding and analysis of the payload are performed."
