  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and system-level interactions indicative of malicious activity. It is designed to conceal its true intent, likely to install malicious packages, create backdoors, or escalate privileges. Given the evidence, it should be treated as malware with high confidence and risk. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before execution."
