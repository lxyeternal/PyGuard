      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and system-level interactions indicative of malicious activity. It is designed to conceal its true intent, likely to install malicious packages, create backdoors, or escalate privileges. Given the evidence, it should be treated as malware with high confidence and risk. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before execution."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits moderate suspicious behaviors, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns, which could conceal malicious intent. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the indicators warrant caution and further analysis before deployment. The overall malware score is around 0.55, obfuscation around 0.75, and security risk approximately 0.65, reflecting the potential for malicious behavior based on the observed signals."
