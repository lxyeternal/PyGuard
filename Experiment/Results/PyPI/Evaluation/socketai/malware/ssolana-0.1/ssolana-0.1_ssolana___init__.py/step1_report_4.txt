  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard functionality, but without seeing specific code content, the purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; typical sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or external data files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands if present. No explicit sinks are identified without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from input sources to sensitive sinks are not identifiable without code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are observed from the provided information. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review relies on the assumption that no suspicious patterns are present. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident without code specifics.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there are no detectable signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign, but without actual code snippets, this assessment remains at low confidence.",
