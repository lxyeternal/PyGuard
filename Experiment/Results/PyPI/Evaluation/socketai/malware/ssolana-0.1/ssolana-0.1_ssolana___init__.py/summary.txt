  "conclusion": "The code exhibits moderate suspicious behaviors, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns, which could conceal malicious intent. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the indicators warrant caution and further analysis before deployment. The overall malware score is around 0.55, obfuscation around 0.75, and security risk approximately 0.65, reflecting the potential for malicious behavior based on the observed signals."
