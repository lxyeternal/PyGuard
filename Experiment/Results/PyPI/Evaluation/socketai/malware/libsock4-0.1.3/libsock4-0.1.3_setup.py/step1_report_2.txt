{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package setup process, with an embedded script that fetches and executes remote code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://pub-6604e90a2a124b9a829b977f9fe4aeec.r2.dev/W0IyABv1wrUvm') via urllib.request, and writes to a temporary file that is later executed.",
  "sinks": "The remote fetched code is executed via exec, which can run arbitrary code fetched from the internet. Additionally, system commands are invoked to start processes based on the current Python executable name, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input from the URL is written into a temporary file, then executed via exec in the embedded code, which constitutes a direct source-to-sink flow. Also, system commands are called that may execute the current Python executable with modified arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding remote code that is fetched dynamically and executed during setup is highly unusual and suspicious. The use of a temporary file to store and execute remote code indicates obfuscation and malicious intent. The URL is suspicious and could be hosting malicious payloads. The code also attempts to launch a process with the Python executable, which could be part of a persistence or backdoor mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and creating a temporary file, into which it writes obfuscated code that fetches and executes remote content from an external URL. This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious code injection. During setup, it tries to start a process with the current Python executable, potentially executing malicious code silently. The embedded remote code reads data from a URL and runs it via exec, which is extremely risky and often used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, backdoors, or payload deployment. The overall structure suggests malicious intent or supply chain sabotage, as it compromises the security of systems installing this package.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious behavior: dynamic remote code fetching and execution, suspicious process invocation, and obfuscation. These are strong indicators of malicious activity designed to compromise systems during installation. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
