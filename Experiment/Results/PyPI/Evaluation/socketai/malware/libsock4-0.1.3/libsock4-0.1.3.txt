      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively fetching and executing remote code during installation, representing a severe supply chain attack vector. The remote URL and use of exec() confirm malicious intent. The high scores assigned are justified, with malware and security risk scores at maximum (1.0), and obfuscation scores reflecting variable name obscurity (~0.3). This package should be considered dangerous and avoided."
