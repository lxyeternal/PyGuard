  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, requests, fernet, and execution of decrypted code within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code which could perform arbitrary actions, especially on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "Imports os to check os.name, conditionally imports requests and Fernet, decrypts and executes code if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Decryption and execution of encrypted payload during install, which could be malicious. The encrypted payload is hidden, and execution occurs during package installation, a potential security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and a custom install class that, on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(). The payload is encrypted, obscuring its purpose, but executing decrypted code during installation is suspicious. The package appears to run potentially malicious code silently during setup. No hardcoded credentials are visible beyond the encrypted payload, but the behavior is unconventional and risky. The rest of the setup code appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a suspicious decryption and execution step that runs during package installation on Windows, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior. This code is likely malicious or a security risk.",
