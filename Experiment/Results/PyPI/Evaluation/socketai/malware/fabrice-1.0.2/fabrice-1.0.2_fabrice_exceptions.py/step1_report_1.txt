{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task management and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; exception classes are defined but no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions with straightforward inheritance from Python's Exception class. It includes docstrings and comments, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication. The classes serve as structural components for error handling and do not perform any logic beyond defining exception types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, harmless, and serves as part of a larger application’s error handling framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
