{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, likely related to task execution or environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurring in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The comments suggest potential code refactoring but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes serve as structured error indicators for specific situations, such as unimplemented tasks, group errors, or environment issues. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code contains only class definitions with straightforward constructors and comments. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
