  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or dynamic behavior. The classes are straightforward, with no external interactions.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and without security risks. This is accurate given the code snippet. They also correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** All reports assign 1, reflecting certainty based on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores**  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The reasoning in the reports aligns with this.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**  \nThe reports correctly challenge any assumptions of vulnerabilities; none are present.\n\n**Step 7: Check consistency of scores with the report**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.  \n- No dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns are present.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are evident.  \n- The exception classes serve as structural components in a larger application, not as vectors for attack.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No changes needed to the reported scores.  \n- The overall risk assessment should be **0** for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring and note that this code fragment is safe and standard for error handling purposes.",
