  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with descriptive docstrings and comments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The comments suggest potential refactoring or organizational changes but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and purpose as error handling scaffolding make it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and serves as part of an error handling framework. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
