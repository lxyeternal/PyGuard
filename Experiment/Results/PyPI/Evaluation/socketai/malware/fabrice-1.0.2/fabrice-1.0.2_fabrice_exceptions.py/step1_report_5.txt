  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python project, potentially related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; all data are internal class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this code only defines exception classes without any execution flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of exception class definitions with comments. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. Each class is straightforward, with minimal logic, mainly constructors for passing data or wrapping results. The comments indicate potential future refactoring or organizational changes but do not introduce malicious behavior or suspicious code. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. Overall, this code is standard exception class definitions with no apparent security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign and solely defines custom exceptions for use elsewhere in a larger application. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
