{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import module for a Python package, defining the public API by importing various classes and functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as ._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, and .executor",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not perform data output or network communication directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet; it only sets up namespace exposure via imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, typical of package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements to expose components of a package. There are no inputs, outputs, or execution logic that could indicate malicious activity. Since it is an import module, it is unlikely to contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure and formatting are normal for such files.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to set up the package namespace. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and no significant vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
