  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, exposing internal modules and components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements do not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements are static and do not involve runtime data transfer or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py or module setup file for a Python package, consisting solely of import statements. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's static and transparent structure confirms the absence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a namespace and component exposer for the package. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concern. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
