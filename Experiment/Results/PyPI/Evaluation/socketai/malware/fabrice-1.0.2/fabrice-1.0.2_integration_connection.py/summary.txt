  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for SSH and command execution, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) reflects the use of a hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable in controlled testing contexts but should be avoided in production code. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and is safe for use in testing environments."
