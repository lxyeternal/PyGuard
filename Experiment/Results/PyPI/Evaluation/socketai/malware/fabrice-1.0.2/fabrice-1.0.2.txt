      "conclusion": "The code primarily performs automation tasks for build, testing, and release workflows. It contains insecure practices like hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations but no active malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate due to these insecure practices, which should be addressed to improve security hygiene. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the code is not obfuscated."

      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no active malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscation detected. Maintaining the integrity of '_version.py' mitigates the risk. The scores are appropriate: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3."

The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) reflects the use of a hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable in controlled testing contexts but should be avoided in production code. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns and is safe for use in testing environments."
