  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing suite for SSH file transfer operations. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the code's purpose and behavior."
