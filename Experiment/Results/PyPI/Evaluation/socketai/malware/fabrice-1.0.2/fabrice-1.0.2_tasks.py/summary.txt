  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs automation tasks for build, testing, and release workflows. It contains insecure practices like hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations but no active malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate due to these insecure practices, which should be addressed to improve security hygiene. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the code is not obfuscated."
