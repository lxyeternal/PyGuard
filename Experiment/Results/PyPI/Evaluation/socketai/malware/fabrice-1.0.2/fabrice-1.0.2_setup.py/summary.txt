  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no active malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscation detected. Maintaining the integrity of '_version.py' mitigates the risk. The scores are appropriate: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3."
