{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up the Python package 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' based on environment and directory structure.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading '_version.py', reading 'README.rst', and static configuration data in setuptools.setup().",
  "sinks": "exec() of contents from '_version.py' (potentially executing untrusted code if the file is compromised), reading files without sanitization, setting up package installation and entry points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package name and entry point; reading '_version.py' executes potentially untrusted code; reading 'README.rst' provides long_description; setup configuration flows to package installation and command-line script execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version info from '_version.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with; no explicit validation or sandboxing; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment checks, directory presence verification, reads version information via exec(), and configures setuptools for package distribution. The use of exec() on a version file is a potential security concern if the '_version.py' file is compromised or maliciously altered, as it could execute arbitrary code. Otherwise, the code is standard setup script for Python packages, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks. The configuration is static and intended for package setup, with no active malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with a notable use of exec() to read version info, which can be a security risk if the version file is tampered with. No malicious behavior or malware detected. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be taken to ensure the version file integrity.",
