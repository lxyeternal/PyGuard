  "purpose": "The script configures the setup for a Python package, determining package name, version, dependencies, and entry points based on environment variables and filesystem checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem directories, and files such as '_version.py' and 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function, environment variable access, file reads, and exec() on '_version.py'.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks influence package configuration; exec() executes code from '_version.py' to determine version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read '_version.py' without validation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging. It reads environment variables and filesystem info to determine package name and version. The version is loaded via exec() from '_version.py', which is common but can be risky if the file is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the potential execution of malicious code if '_version.py' is tampered with. The malware score is set to 0.2, reflecting this risk, while the obfuscation score remains 0. due to the straightforward nature of the code. The overall security risk is low but warrants ensuring the integrity of '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no active malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscation detected. Maintaining the integrity of '_version.py' mitigates the risk. The scores are appropriate: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3.",
