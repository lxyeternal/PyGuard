      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package installation. The pattern matches known malicious tactics, and the silent error handling further conceals potential malicious actions. The scores are appropriate; decoding the command is recommended for definitive confirmation."
