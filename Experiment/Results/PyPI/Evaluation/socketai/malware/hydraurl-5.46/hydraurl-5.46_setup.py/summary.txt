  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and concealed execution tactics indicative of malicious activity, especially in supply chain contexts. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the suspicious patterns justify a high malware score and security concern. The package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further analysis."
