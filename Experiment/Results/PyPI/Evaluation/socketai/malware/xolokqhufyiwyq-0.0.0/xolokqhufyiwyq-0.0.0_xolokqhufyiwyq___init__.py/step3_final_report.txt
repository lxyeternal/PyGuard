{
  "purpose": "The code harvests Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates them, retrieves user information, and exfiltrates all data to a Discord webhook, aiming to steal user credentials and personal data.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chrome, edge, opera, chromium) via browser_cookie3; IP address via https://api.ipify.org/; Roblox user info via Roblox API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL, transmitting cookies, user info, and IP address.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browsers -> validated with robloxpy -> user info fetched from Roblox API -> all data compiled and sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unsolicited collection of cookies from multiple browsers, validation of Roblox cookies, and exfiltration of sensitive user data without user consent; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script straightforwardly harvests Roblox cookies from multiple browsers using browser_cookie3, validates the cookies with robloxpy, retrieves user info such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, and other details, then exfiltrates all gathered data, including the cookies and IP address, to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The code lacks obfuscation, employs standard modules, and performs malicious data theft activities. The data flow from source (cookie collection) to sink (webhook) is direct and unprotected, indicating malicious intent to hijack accounts and steal user data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Roblox users, actively harvesting cookies and personal information and exfiltrating it to an external server. Its straightforward implementation and data exfiltration behavior confirm high malicious intent and security risk.",
