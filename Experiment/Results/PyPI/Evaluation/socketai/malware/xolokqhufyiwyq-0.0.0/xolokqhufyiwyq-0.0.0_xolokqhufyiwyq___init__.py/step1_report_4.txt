{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox account cookies and user information, then send this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser storage for domains related to Roblox using browser_cookie3, and retrieves external IP address via an HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data (cookies, IP address, account info) to a Discord webhook, potentially exposing sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Cookie data is collected from browser cookies -> verified for validity -> user info is fetched via Roblox API -> data is sent to webhook; cookie value flows from storage to API request to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie extraction methods to obtain '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies; hardcoded Discord webhook URL; collecting and transmitting sensitive account cookies and IP address; no user consent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script actively collects Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers, indicating intent to hijack or monitor Roblox accounts. It verifies cookie validity, then gathers detailed user info including user ID, Robux balance, account age, friends, and IP address. All data is sent to a Discord webhook URL, which is hardcoded in the script. The code does not perform any obfuscated or malicious code execution, but it explicitly aims to harvest sensitive user data without user consent, which constitutes malicious activity. There are no signs of backdoors, remote code execution, or data exfiltration beyond the webhook. The script's purpose aligns with malicious data theft, akin to a credential logger.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential and information logger targeting Roblox accounts, exfiltrating sensitive data to an external Discord webhook. Its purpose appears malicious, primarily aimed at stealing cookies and user data without authorization.",
