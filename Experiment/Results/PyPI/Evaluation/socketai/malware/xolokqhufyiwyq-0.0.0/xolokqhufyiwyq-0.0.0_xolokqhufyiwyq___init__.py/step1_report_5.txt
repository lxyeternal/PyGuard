{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a Roblox account cookie logger, collecting cookies, user information, and IP address, then sending this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) via browser_cookie3; user IP via api.ipify.org; Roblox API endpoints for user info.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to a Discord webhook URL, including sensitive cookies and user info.",
  "flows": "Cookie data is retrieved from browser cookies, validated via robloxpy, then used to fetch user info and sent directly to the webhook. IP address is also collected and included in the webhook data.",
  "anomalies": "The script is designed solely to collect and exfiltrate Roblox cookies and user data without user consent, which is malicious behavior. It uses a publicly available IP API, retrieves cookies from multiple browsers, and sends sensitive data to a remote webhook. The code is straightforward but clearly intended for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and setting a webhook URL. It defines a function 'cookieLogger' that attempts to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers. If successful, the cookie is stored for later use. It fetches the user's IP address using a public API. It then verifies the Roblox cookie validity via 'robloxpy'. If invalid, it notifies via webhook and exits. If valid, it collects various user data from Roblox's API, including UserID, UserName, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile info. It also retrieves additional info such as RAP, friends count, and avatar headshot via 'robloxpy'. Finally, it posts all gathered data, including the cookie and IP address, to the specified webhook. The entire process is designed for stealthy exfiltration of user credentials and personal info, which is inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, intended to hijack Roblox account cookies and exfiltrate sensitive user data to an external webhook. It operates covertly by collecting cookies from various browsers and validating them before data theft. This script constitutes a clear example of malicious activity and should be regarded as dangerous.",
