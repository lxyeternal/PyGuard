  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code **actively collects Roblox cookies** from multiple browsers using `browser_cookie3`.\n- It **validates the cookie** via `robloxpy.Utils.CheckCookie`.\n- If valid, it **fetches user info** from Roblox API and `robloxpy`.\n- It **exfiltrates all data** (cookies, user info, IP) to a **hardcoded Discord webhook**.\n- No obfuscation or advanced malware techniques are present; the code is straightforward.\n- The primary purpose is **unauthorized data collection and exfiltration**, indicating malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Malicious credential stealer, exfiltrates Roblox cookies and info.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the malicious intent, high confidence (0.9), malware score (1), and security risk (1).\n- **Score Justification:** Given the clear exfiltration behavior, the high malware and risk scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describes the code as a credential stealer.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the malicious activity, high confidence (0.9), malware (0.9), security risk (0.9).\n- **Score Justification:** Slightly lower malware score (0.9) is acceptable but could be argued as 1 given the activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; scores are reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, describes as a cookie logger and info stealer.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies malicious intent, high confidence (0.9), malware (1), security risk (1).\n- **Score Justification:** Fully justified given the exfiltration of cookies and personal data.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar description, cookie logger and exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies malicious activity, high confidence (0.9), malware (0.9), security risk (0.9).\n- **Score Justification:** Slightly lower malware score acceptable, but could be argued as 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable, but perhaps a slight increase in malware score could be considered.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others, cookie logger and info exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states malicious intent, very high confidence (0.95), malware (1), security risk (1).\n- **Score Justification:** Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign high malware scores (~0.9-1), which is appropriate given the exfiltration behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct—no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign high risk (1), justified by the malicious data theft.\n\n### Any inconsistencies?\n- Slight variation in malware scores (0.9 vs 1) is acceptable; the activity is clearly malicious in all cases.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code **matches the reports' assessments**; all reports correctly identify the malicious intent.\n- The **scores are consistent** with the code's behavior.\n- The **confidence levels** are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 1 (full malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 1 (high security risk due to credential theft and data exfiltration)\n\nThis aligns with the code's behavior and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code. The scores reflect the malicious nature of the script appropriately.",
