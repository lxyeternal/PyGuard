{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a Roblox account information logger, gathering cookies, user details, and system IP, then sending this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser storage using browser_cookie3 for various browsers, and makes HTTP GET requests to fetch IP address and user info. Reads Roblox cookie from browser cookies.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected cookies and user info to a Discord webhook via POST requests. Uses os.system to execute system commands (though not malicious here).",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser storage, validated via robloxpy, then user info is fetched and sent to webhook. Cookie data flows from browser cookies to server request, and user info flows from Roblox API to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Highly suspicious activity: collects and exfiltrates Roblox cookies and account info without user consent, uses multiple browser cookie sources, and sends data to external webhook. The message 'Loading...' and variable names suggest possible distraction or obfuscation, though not explicitly malicious. No obfuscation detected beyond straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The script extracts cookies related to Roblox from various browser cookie stores, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chromium-based browsers. It verifies the cookie's validity with Roblox API. Upon success, it gathers user details such as UserID, username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, creation date, friends count, and profile/headshot links. It also fetches the public IP address. All sensitive information, including the Roblox cookie and account details, are then exfiltrated via a Discord webhook. The code employs standard library functions and publicly available modules, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The main concern is the unauthorized collection and exfiltration of user account data, indicating malicious intent aligned with credential theft and account hijacking activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent, designed to steal Roblox account cookies and sensitive user information by exfiltrating data to an external Discord webhook. It uses standard libraries but manipulates user data without consent, indicating malicious behavior with high security risk.",
