  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies and user information from the browser, validate the cookies, gather user data, and send this information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie; requests to external APIs for IP address and Roblox user info.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data, including cookies and user info, directly to a Discord webhook via HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie extraction -> Cookie validation via robloxpy -> User info requests -> Data compilation -> Data sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The script actively steals user cookies and personal Roblox data, then exfiltrates it to an external server (Discord webhook). It uses multiple browser cookie extraction methods, attempts to validate cookies, and exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent. The code structure indicates intent for malicious data theft rather than benign functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defines functions for executing system commands and clearing the console. It then attempts to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers using browser_cookie3. It stores cookies and their values if found. The script retrieves the external IP address via an API call. It validates the Roblox cookie with robloxpy.Utils.CheckCookie; if invalid, it reports and exits. If valid, it requests user info from Roblox's API, extracting UserID, username, and other data. Additional data such as RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, headshot, Robux balance, and premium status are gathered using robloxpy functions. Finally, all this data, including the cookie, is formatted into a message and sent to a specified Discord webhook. The core malicious behavior is the theft of cookies and user information, which are exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled webhook, constituting a clear privacy violation and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a cookie logger and information stealer targeting Roblox users. It extracts cookies from browser storage, validates them, collects user data, and exfiltrates it to an external Discord webhook. The script's behavior is malicious, designed for unauthorized data theft with no user consent, and it actively compromises user privacy and security.",
