{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from the user's browser, validate the cookie, gather user information from Roblox, and send this information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for roblox.com domain; IP address via api.ipify.org; Roblox user info via mobileapi and external Robloxpy API; environment variables (indirectly via browser cookies).",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request that transmits cookie data, user info, and IP address to Discord; execution of system commands (though not actively used in the current code).",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browser -> cookie validation -> user info retrieval -> data packaging -> POST request to webhook with sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of browser_cookie3 to extract cookies without user consent; inclusion of the Roblox cookie in a webhook message; potential for misuse of cookies to hijack accounts; code lacks obfuscation, but the functionality is suspicious for a credential stealer.",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers using browser_cookie3, which is often used in malicious scripts to harvest user credentials. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, retrieves personal Roblox data, including user ID, username, Robux balance, account age, and friends count. The script also obtains the user's IP address. All collected data is sent to a Discord webhook, including the Roblox cookie itself, which indicates malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscation, but the purpose aligns with credential theft and user data exfiltration. System command functions are defined but not used, suggesting possible extensibility or prior use. Overall, the code's intent is to harvest sensitive user data and transmit it without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a credential stealer targeting Roblox users by extracting cookies from browsers, validating and extracting user info, and exfiltrating all data to an external webhook. The behavior is malicious, designed to compromise user accounts and leak personal data. The code demonstrates typical traits of malware used for account hijacking and data theft.",
