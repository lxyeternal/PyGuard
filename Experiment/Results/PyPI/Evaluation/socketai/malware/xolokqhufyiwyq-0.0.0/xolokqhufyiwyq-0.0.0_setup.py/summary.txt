  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for Python package distribution. The obfuscated package name warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further inspection of the actual package contents is recommended before deployment."
