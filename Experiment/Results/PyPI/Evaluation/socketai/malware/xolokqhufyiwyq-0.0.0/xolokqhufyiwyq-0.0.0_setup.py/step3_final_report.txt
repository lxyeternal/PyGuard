{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the package metadata and dependencies for distribution. It appears to be a standard Python package setup with no dynamic code or malicious logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the script only calls setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static data assigned to variables and passed to setup(), with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'xolokqhufyiwyq' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. Author fields are empty, which is atypical but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, secrets, or malicious constructs. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated package name, which could be used to conceal intent but does not indicate malicious activity. Dependency packages are common and benign. No data flows or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for Python package distribution. The obfuscated package name warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). Further inspection of the actual package contents is recommended before deployment.",
