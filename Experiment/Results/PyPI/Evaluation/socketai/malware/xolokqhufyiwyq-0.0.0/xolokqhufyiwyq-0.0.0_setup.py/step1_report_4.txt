  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'xolokqhufyiwyq', specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies from the setup script.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed; no direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; the code initializes package setup with static data.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears to be a random string, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. The author fields are empty, which is not typical but not malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools. It defines a version string and calls setup() with package metadata and a list of dependencies. The dependencies include common libraries such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. The package name appears to be a random string, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with an unusual package name but no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.",
