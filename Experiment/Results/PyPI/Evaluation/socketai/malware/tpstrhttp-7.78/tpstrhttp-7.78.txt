      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the embedded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently under specific filesystem conditions. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are significant, warranting caution and further analysis of the payload. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until the encoded command is decoded and verified."
