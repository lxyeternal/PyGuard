  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command triggered by a filesystem check, with suppressed errors and a suspicious URL comment. The obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment tactics strongly suggest malicious intent. The package setup code itself appears benign but is overshadowed by embedded malicious payloads. Overall, this code should be considered malicious and warrants further investigation."
