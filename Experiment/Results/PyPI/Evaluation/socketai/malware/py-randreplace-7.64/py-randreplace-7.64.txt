      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, with external URL comments and error suppression. The high scores across reports are justified, indicating a high probability of malicious behavior. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further decoding confirms payload details."
