  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and context strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting caution and further analysis. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
