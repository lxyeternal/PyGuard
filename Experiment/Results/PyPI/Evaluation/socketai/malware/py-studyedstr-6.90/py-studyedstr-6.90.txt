      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating likely malicious intent. The silent error handling further conceals potential malicious activity. Scores assigned are consistent with the observed behavior, and the package should be treated with high suspicion pending further payload analysis."
