  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious indicators, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command with a suspicious URL, during package installation. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and silent error handling justify high malware and security risk scores. The package should be flagged as malicious or compromised, and further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended."
