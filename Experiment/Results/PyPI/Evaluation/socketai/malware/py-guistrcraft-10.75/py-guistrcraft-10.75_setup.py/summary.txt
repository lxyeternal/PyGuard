  "conclusion": "The code actively executes an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The pattern suggests a supply chain attack vector or backdoor. The high obfuscation, conditional execution, and silent error handling warrant a high security risk assessment. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, this package should be treated as potentially malicious and investigated thoroughly before use or distribution."
