  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or code injection patterns are present. The absence of code in some reports confirms no malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels are high where analysis is possible. Overall, the code appears benign, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, straightforward, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation. The scoring and assessments across reports are accurate and consistent with the evidence. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
