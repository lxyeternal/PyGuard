  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing or utility function, likely involving some external inputs or data handling.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()', reading environment variables, or reading from files or network sockets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, writing to files, or executing dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (system commands, network calls, file writes), possibly via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues such as input validation, data leakage, insecure function use, or hidden backdoors. It primarily employs standard Python libraries and functions, with no signs of malicious intent like data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or backdoor mechanisms. The structure and formatting are typical for utility scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with no immediate security risks identified.",
