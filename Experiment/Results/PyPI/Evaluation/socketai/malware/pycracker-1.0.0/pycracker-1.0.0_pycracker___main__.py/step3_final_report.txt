{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, configuration files, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into data handling functions; no suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code present, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code snippets are benign, consisting of import statements, configuration reads, or data handling routines. Confidence levels are appropriate, and scores for malware and security risk are consistent with the evidence, remaining at zero or very low. No suspicious patterns, dynamic execution, or network exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary based on the provided code snippets.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
