{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the implementation of a Python package for general utility functions, possibly for data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and imported modules. Specifically, it fetches configuration from environment variables and user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (if any), file writing operations, or subprocess calls (if present). In this case, it appears to write to files and possibly make network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input through functions, possibly reaching output functions like file write operations or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code does not contain obfuscated code, excessive dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. No signs of malicious backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by importing standard modules, sets up functions, and reads configuration data from environment variables and parameters. There are no unusual or suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, suspicious domain connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic appears to be straightforward and aligned with common utility scripts. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code seems to serve as a benign utility module without malicious intent. It does not exhibit behaviors typical of malware or supply chain attacks. No security risks are identified in this analysis.",
