  "purpose": "Obfuscated code with layered decoding and eval, likely malicious.",

  "sinks": "eval executing reconstructed code, potential malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Import → decode/decompress → dynamic code assembly → eval.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, layered decoding, eval, base64 blobs, dynamic string generation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple layers of obfuscation, including base64 and zlib, with dynamic code execution via eval. The structure is typical of malware trying to hide its true intent.",
