  "purpose": "The code appears to collect environment and user information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to https://0v0.in/pypi/",
  "flows": "Sources (user, cwd, hostname) -> data sent via requests.post() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting environment info and immediately transmitting it without user consent; the URL is suspicious and not a standard package repository; no validation or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules requests, getpass, socket, os. It defines package name and version variables. It then sends an HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain (0v0.in) containing the current user's username, working directory, and hostname. No input validation, error handling, or user notification is present. The purpose appears to be collecting system and user info covertly, which can be considered malicious behavior. No code obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected beyond this data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and exfiltrates environment data to an untrusted external domain, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It may serve as a privacy violation or backdoor. The behavior warrants caution and further review.",
