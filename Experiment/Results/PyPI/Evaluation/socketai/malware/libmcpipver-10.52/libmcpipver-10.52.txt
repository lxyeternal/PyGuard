      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent, executing hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands during setup, triggered by a directory check, with a suspicious URL. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional behavior strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and security risk score of 0.9."
