      "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior through obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands conditioned on filesystem state. The setup code appears benign but likely serves as a cover. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Decoding the PowerShell command would clarify payload intent, but current evidence warrants treating this as malicious. The reports are accurate and consistent; the package should be considered potentially harmful until further analysis confirms otherwise."
