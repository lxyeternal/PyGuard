{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious payload designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, and potential backdoor installation. It gathers browser data, Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive information, then exfiltrates it via Discord webhooks and file hosting services. It also attempts to disable debugging tools and VM detection, and can modify browser extension data for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browser storage, log files, cookies, passwords), system registry, network requests (public IP, geolocation, webhook URLs), and local system commands (listing directories, process termination).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to external webhooks, file upload services, and system processes. Sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data) are sent via HTTP POST requests to remote servers. Files are compressed and uploaded to external servers. Potential command execution (taskkill, shutil copy, zip operations) could impact system stability.",
  "flows": "Data from browser storage, cookies, and logs are decrypted and collected; then, they are sent to remote webhook URLs and file hosting services. Tokens are extracted from logs and files, validated, and sent. Browser extension and system data are also gathered and uploaded. Some functions modify browser extension files and zip directories for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes aggressive anti-debugging checks, VM detection, and process termination for debugging tools. It installs itself into startup directories to persist. It dynamically installs dependencies without validation. Obvious malicious indicators include token harvesting, credential collection, password extraction, browser data scraping, and data exfiltration to external endpoints. It also uses obfuscated variable names and redundant code to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a credential stealer and data exfiltrator, leveraging browser data access, Discord token scraping, and cookie extraction. It uses system commands to terminate known debugging processes and checks for VM indicators to evade analysis. It exfiltrates data through Discord webhooks and file hosting services. The script also collects information such as IP address, geolocation, Discord account details, and system info. The presence of functions that zip directories, upload files, and manipulate browser profiles confirms malicious intent. The code is structured to run persistently, installing itself into startup folders and continuously scanning the system. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, including process killing, obfuscation, and redundant code paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system data, then exfiltrate it to external servers via webhooks and upload services. It incorporates anti-debugging, VM detection, persistence mechanisms, and data collection routines indicative of malware used for credential theft and espionage. The overall security risk is high.",
