{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious data collection, credential theft, device and environment detection, and data exfiltration, likely used for malicious reconnaissance or hacking activities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (like login data, cookies, local storage), system registry, process lists, and network requests (e.g., fetching IP, geolocation, and tokens). It reads from user directories, browser data folders, and specific system files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are HTTP requests to external webhooks and servers, including file uploads, token exfiltration, and data posting to external services (e.g., Gofile, Discord webhooks). It writes to files locally and uploads sensitive data. Execution of subprocesses and process termination also act as sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and local files (browser cookies, login data, tokens) through decryption and parsing functions. Extracted tokens and sensitive info are then sent via HTTP requests to external servers. Environment checks (sandbox, VM, debugger) may lead to process termination if detected. Data collection functions run in multiple threads, collecting browser data, tokens, credentials, and system info, then exfiltrate via webhooks or upload links.",
  "anomalies": "Use of anti-debugging techniques (e.g., debugger detection, process termination), environment checks for VM and sandbox detection, persistent copy of the script to startup folder, obfuscated variable names, and extensive use of threading for data collection. The code also contains logic to zip and upload collected files, indicating a focus on stealthy data exfiltration. Hardcoded webhook URLs and base64-encoded data handling further suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: it infects startup folders for persistence, detects virtualized or debug environments to evade analysis, extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data, decrypts sensitive information, and exfiltrates the data through webhooks and file upload services. It also has functions targeting Discord tokens, billing info, and other sensitive data, which are then sent to external servers. Threaded operations for data collection increase efficiency and stealth. Overall, the code is designed to gather extensive user data, avoid detection, and send it externally without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious malware designed for credential harvesting, environment detection, persistence, and exfiltration. It targets browser data, tokens, billing info, and files, then sends this data to attacker-controlled servers via webhooks and uploads. Its anti-debugging, VM detection, and persistence mechanisms further indicate malicious intent. It is highly risky to run or include this code in any package.",
