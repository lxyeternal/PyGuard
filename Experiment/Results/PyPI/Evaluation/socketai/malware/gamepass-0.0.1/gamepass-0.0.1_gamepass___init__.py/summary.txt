  "conclusion": "This module is unequivocally malicious, performing credential theft, data exfiltration, process manipulation, and injection activities designed to compromise system security and exfiltrate sensitive data. Its obfuscation and anti-debug measures further confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is maximal, and the code should be flagged and mitigated immediately."
