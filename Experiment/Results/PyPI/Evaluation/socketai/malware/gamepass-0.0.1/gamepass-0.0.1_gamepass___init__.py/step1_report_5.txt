{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for extracting, collecting, and exfiltrating sensitive user data including tokens, cookies, passwords, browser info, and system details, then uploading this data to external servers. It also includes modules for checking system environment for debugging tools or virtual machine indicators, and it can modify files related to Discord and browser extensions, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads user input and data from system files (browsers' login and cookie storage, Discord data folders), environment variables, network requests to external URLs, and files in user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to webhooks and file upload services (e.g., gofile.io). It writes malicious payloads into Discord's index.js files, uploads files to external servers, and executes system commands to kill processes and manipulate files. Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and user info are exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "Sources include local system files, browser storage, environment variables, and network responses. Extracted data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and user info flow into in-memory variables and are eventually uploaded to external servers through HTTP requests. The code also injects malicious scripts into Discord files, and it zips and uploads user files from specified paths. Process-killing functions control running processes related to browsers and wallet applications.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically installs dependencies without user consent, uses obfuscated or misleading variable names, performs system environment checks for debugging tools and VM indicators, injects malicious code into Discord files, and exfiltrates data via external webhooks and file upload services. It copies itself into startup folders, indicating persistence. Additionally, it manipulates browser data directories, extracts tokens, and performs multi-threaded operations for data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with environment checks for debuggers and VMs, suggesting anti-analysis techniques. It installs dependencies silently. It reads sensitive data such as tokens, cookies, and passwords from browser storage and Discord directories, decrypts them, and formats them for exfiltration. It injects malicious JavaScript into Discord's core files to capture further data. The code captures user system info, IP address, and geolocation data. It then exfiltrates all gathered data through webhooks and file uploads. It also copies itself into the startup folder to ensure persistence. The code contains obfuscated variables, dynamic process termination, and network activity that point toward malicious intent. Overall, the code's activities involve data theft, system manipulation, and stealth techniques typical of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to perform extensive user data theft (tokens, cookies, passwords, personal info), system information collection, and injection of malicious scripts into Discord files for further data capture. It exfiltrates data to external servers and maintains persistence, indicating clear malware behavior with high security risks.",
