      "conclusion": "The package code is benign with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious email domain, which should be investigated outside this context. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored at 0, and the security risk is marginally elevated due to the domain. Overall, the code is safe, with a minor external concern."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, involving remote code fetching, dynamic execution, and process spawning without validation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, with a malware score close to 1. The obfuscation level is low, as the code is straightforward, but indirect execution tactics are used. The overall security risk is very high, warranting immediate review and removal. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with slight adjustments to obfuscation scores to reflect the code's clarity."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The first report's high scores are justified given the suspicious patterns, notably eval and obfuscation. Other reports correctly assign low or zero scores based on their benign or incomplete content. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, indicating moderate to high risk only in Report 1. Further code review is recommended for the flagged segments in Report 1 to confirm malicious intent."
