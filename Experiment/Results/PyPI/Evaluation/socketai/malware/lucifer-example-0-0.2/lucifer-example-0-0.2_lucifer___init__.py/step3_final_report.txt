  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sources, eval/exec functions, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, code execution functions (eval), data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to code injection or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic eval usage, conditional behaviors based on environment variables, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 identifies suspicious behaviors such as eval and obfuscation, justifying high malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores. Reports 2, 3, 4, and 5 lack evidence of malicious activity; their low scores are appropriate. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with Report 1 warranting concern due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation, while others are benign or lack sufficient data.",
  "conclusion": "The first report's high scores are justified given the suspicious patterns, notably eval and obfuscation. Other reports correctly assign low or zero scores based on their benign or incomplete content. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, indicating moderate to high risk only in Report 1. Further code review is recommended for the flagged segments in Report 1 to confirm malicious intent.",
