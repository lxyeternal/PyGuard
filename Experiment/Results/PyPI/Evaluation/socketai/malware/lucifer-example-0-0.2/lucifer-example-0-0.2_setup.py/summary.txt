  "conclusion": "The package code is benign with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the suspicious email domain, which should be investigated outside this context. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored at 0, and the security risk is marginally elevated due to the domain. Overall, the code is safe, with a minor external concern."
