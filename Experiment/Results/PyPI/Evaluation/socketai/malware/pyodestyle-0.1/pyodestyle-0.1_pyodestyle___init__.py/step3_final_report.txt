  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code structure, signals, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic execution points (exec/eval).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmission, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "From sources like input or environment variables to sinks such as network or file system, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, scattered imports, unusual variable naming, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears benign if straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. When obfuscation and dynamic execution are present, suspicion increases. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity are evident. The confidence in benign assessments is high when code is clear; suspicion rises with obfuscation and dynamic features. The primary concern is obfuscated code with dynamic execution, which can hide malicious intent. The overall risk depends on the presence of such signals, with higher scores assigned when suspicious techniques are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign or lack sufficient detail to assess. When obfuscation and dynamic execution are present, the potential for malicious intent increases, warranting higher malware and security risk scores. Minor score adjustments are recommended based on the suspicion level, notably raising the malware score for obfuscated code with dynamic features.",
