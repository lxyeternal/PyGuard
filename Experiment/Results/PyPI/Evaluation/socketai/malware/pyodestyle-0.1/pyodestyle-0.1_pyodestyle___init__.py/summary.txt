  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign or lack sufficient detail to assess. When obfuscation and dynamic execution are present, the potential for malicious intent increases, warranting higher malware and security risk scores. Minor score adjustments are recommended based on the suspicion level, notably raising the malware score for obfuscated code with dynamic features."
