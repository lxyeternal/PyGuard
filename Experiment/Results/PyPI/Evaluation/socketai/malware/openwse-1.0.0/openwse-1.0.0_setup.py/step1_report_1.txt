  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'openwse' with a custom installation process that executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements (requests, fernet), encrypted code decryption and execution within the run() method of a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which executes dynamic code during installation.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and fernet -> decrypt and execute code via exec() during install.run() on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted string and decryption that leads to execution of code; code execution during install phase; obfuscated class name and variable naming; use of exec() with decrypted payload.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it dynamically. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution suggests obfuscation. The code does not appear to contain hardcoded credentials but executes potentially malicious code during installation. This behavior can be used for malicious purposes such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script's obfuscation and execution of decrypted payload pose security risks. No other suspicious network connections or data leaks are directly observable outside the decryption and execution process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
