{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to install a Python package named 'openwse' with specific metadata and a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from variables, imports modules, and executes code within the custom install class. Notably, it imports 'requests', 'os', and 'fernet', and executes decrypted code using Fernet within the run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec()' within the install class, which could run arbitrary code supplied in the encrypted payload. The 'exec' function is a significant sink for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation, if the OS is Windows ('nt'), the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it with 'exec()'. This decrypted code can perform any action on the host system, making this a critical flow point.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class name 'zSNFQnzixoysimKTpXKuyBNvkphZFkzaOuiwMgCmeradwahTOozLLXGECPutzEjdWrHXRKqnmZdrMxhgMVdaaUdgsOXEsTioUEMHAiNIxnkJFavUnnBYnMAeIKMRYvgbqJEqetNKOGOpcQuGdBYdHZwIB' and encrypted payload suggest deliberate concealment. The decrypted payload is executed directly without validation. The use of encrypted data and dynamic execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and a custom install command that, upon execution on Windows systems, decrypts and runs arbitrary code embedded in a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted string. The use of 'exec()' on decrypted data is a classic indicator of malicious payload delivery. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload strongly suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. No benign purpose justifies such behavior in a setup script, especially executing code dynamically during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious pattern: it decrypts and executes code during package installation on Windows systems, which could allow remote code execution or other malicious actions. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered highly dangerous.",
