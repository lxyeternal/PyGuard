      "conclusion": "The code contains a high probability of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command in a hidden manner, triggered conditionally. The setup function appears benign but is overshadowed by the suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis is performed."
