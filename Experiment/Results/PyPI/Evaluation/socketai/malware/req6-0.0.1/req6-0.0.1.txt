      "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The scoring is consistent with the summaries. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 across all reports could better reflect the absence of vulnerabilities, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are valid and reliable based on available information."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through remote code fetching and execution, with obfuscation techniques employed. All reports correctly identify this pattern, and their scores are justified. The overall security risk is extremely high, warranting classification as malicious. No adjustments are necessary; the code should be flagged as a severe security threat."
