  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the scoring, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues detected; high confidence (0.8).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report claims the code is benign, with no obfuscation or malware, and a low security risk.\n- The confidence score is reasonable given the lack of code details.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high if truly no issues are detected; perhaps a 0.1 would be more fitting, but it's acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1—benign, no malicious patterns, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- The securityRisk score again seems slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- The high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious activity, benign, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; no issues found.\n- The risk score remains conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** No indicators of malicious behavior, benign, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1), which is appropriate given the absence of issues.\n- The reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity detected, low risk, moderate confidence (0.8).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; no issues detected.\n- The securityRisk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n\n- All reports confidently state that the code appears benign, with no obfuscation or malware.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- The securityRisk scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the lack of detected issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed as **0** across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified, a conservative risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** is appropriate. I would suggest standardizing at **0.1** for the highest confidence assessments, unless new evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent and well-reasoned.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the lack of code details.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless new code or context is provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1-0.2 (recommend 0.1) |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1-0.2 (recommend 0.1) |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1-0.2 (recommend 0.1) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (acceptable) |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2 (acceptable) |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current assessments.**",
