  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, data processing functions, environment variables, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, with outputs potentially reaching sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected based on summaries.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently conclude benign behavior with no obfuscation or malicious activity. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 align with the descriptions. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), appropriate given the lack of actual code. Without code snippets, assessments rely on summarized behavior, which appears reasonable and conservative.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The scoring is consistent with the summaries. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 across all reports could better reflect the absence of vulnerabilities, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are valid and reliable based on available information.",
