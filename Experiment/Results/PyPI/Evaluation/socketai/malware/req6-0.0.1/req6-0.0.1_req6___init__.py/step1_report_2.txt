{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script designed to perform a specific task, potentially involving data processing or system interaction, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from user prompts, environment variables, or external files, depending on the specific implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or sensitive data handling functions where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables, files) through processing functions, potentially reaching sensitive sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flow are immediately evident. The code structure appears typical, but without seeing external dependencies or specific functions, some anomalies cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows standard code patterns: input collection, data processing, and output. No evidence of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is detected within the visible code. Use of third-party libraries appears normal, and no suspicious behavior like dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present. The code's security risk level is low, and confidence in this assessment is high, though limited by lack of external context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code seems typical of standard Python scripts, with no suspicious activities or security flaws apparent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
