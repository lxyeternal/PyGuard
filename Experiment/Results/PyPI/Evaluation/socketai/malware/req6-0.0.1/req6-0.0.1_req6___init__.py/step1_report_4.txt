  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no clear purpose specified within the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; typical sources would include environment variables, user input, or external files, but none are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks such as network transmission, file writes, or execution points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow is evident based on the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are apparent in the provided fragment. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code reveals standard Python syntax with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or malicious obfuscation techniques. The code does not exhibit typical malware patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The absence of input/output operations and the lack of external dependencies in the snippet suggest low likelihood of malicious intent. However, without the complete code, some behavior cannot be definitively assessed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities or anomalies detected. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the limited code provided.",
