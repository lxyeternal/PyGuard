  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The scoring is consistent with the summaries. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 across all reports could better reflect the absence of vulnerabilities, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the assessments are valid and reliable based on available information."
