      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup, indicating malicious intent with high likelihood. The activity poses a significant security threat, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.85, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.85. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified based on the evidence."
