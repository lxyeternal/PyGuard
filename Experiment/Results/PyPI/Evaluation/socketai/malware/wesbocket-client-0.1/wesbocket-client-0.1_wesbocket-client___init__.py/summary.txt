  "security_risk": 0.5,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that some reports indicate moderate malicious potential, especially where dynamic execution and obfuscation are present. The current scoring is generally appropriate, but slight upward adjustments for malware scores in reports 2 and 4 improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency exhibits moderate security risks, warranting cautious handling and further review if additional code details emerge."
