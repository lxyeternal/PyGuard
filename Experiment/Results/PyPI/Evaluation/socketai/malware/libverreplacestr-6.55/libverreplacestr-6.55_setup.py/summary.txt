  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. The silent error handling and suspicious comments further support malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as compromised until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
