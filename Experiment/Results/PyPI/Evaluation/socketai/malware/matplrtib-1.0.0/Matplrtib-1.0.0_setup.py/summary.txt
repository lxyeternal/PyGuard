  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-confidence malicious behavior, decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows. The obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks aiming to embed backdoors or malicious functionalities. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
