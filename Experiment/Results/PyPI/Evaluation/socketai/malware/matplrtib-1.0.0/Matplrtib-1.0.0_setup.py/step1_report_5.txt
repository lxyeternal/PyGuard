{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'Matplrtib' with some metadata and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info (os.name), importing modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), decrypting and executing code via Fernet, package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec' on decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code during installation if conditions are met.",
  "flows": "If 'os.name' == 'nt', import requests and fernet, then execute code obtained by decrypting a Fernet-encrypted string; this can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload with Fernet, conditional code execution based on OS, including import and execution of external code during install.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup for a Python package with malicious intent hidden behind obfuscation. A custom install class checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', then decrypts a payload using Fernet with a hardcoded key. The decrypted string is then executed via 'exec'. This pattern indicates a backdoor or malicious code execution during package installation. The use of encrypted code, conditional execution, and dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The code does not show any benign purpose for the encrypted payload, and the obfuscation further supports suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems, which could be a backdoor or malicious payload. The use of encrypted payload and obfuscated class names indicates malicious intent. Overall, the package appears compromised and potentially dangerous.",
