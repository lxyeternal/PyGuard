  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring installation details and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info (os.name), package metadata, and includes an embedded encrypted payload in a class method.",
  "sinks": "The embedded encrypted payload is decrypted and executed dynamically; import of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules; usage of exec with decrypted data.",
  "flows": "Environment check -> Conditional import and execution of decrypted code -> Potential execution of decrypted payload",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data decrypted and executed at install time; obfuscated class and variable names; the code executes 'exec' with decrypted content, which is a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py with obfuscated class and variable names. It defines package metadata and dependencies. Notably, it contains a class whose run() method executes a conditional code block on Windows systems. Inside this block, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. The encrypted data and the 'exec' call suggest potential malicious behavior, such as executing hidden payloads during installation. The use of obfuscated identifiers and the dynamic execution of decrypted code are common techniques in malicious packages. The dependencies 'fernet' and 'requests' are explicitly required, but their presence alone is not suspicious; their usage in executing decrypted code raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains potentially malicious behavior due to the embedded encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows systems. This behavior suggests an attempt to run hidden code, which could be malicious. The overall structure and obfuscation indicate malicious intent, and the use of 'exec' on decrypted data is a significant security risk.",
