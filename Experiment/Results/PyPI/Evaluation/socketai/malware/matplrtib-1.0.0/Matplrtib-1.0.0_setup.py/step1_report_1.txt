{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation process that may execute decrypted code during installation, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string within a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted payload contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "During installation, if os.name is 'nt', the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted string, and executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated class name, encrypted payload executed at install time, and absence of clear documentation or comments. The encrypted payload could hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package and a custom install class. Inside this class, during Windows OS detection, it decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it directly, which is highly suspicious. The encrypted data is hidden and could contain malicious code, including system commands, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity under the guise of a standard setup script. The code does not validate or log the decrypted content, increasing risk. Use of encrypted code execution during setup is a common tactic for malware delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload encrypted within the setup script that executes during installation on Windows systems, representing a significant security threat. The obfuscation and execution of decrypted code point to malicious intent, with high confidence.",
