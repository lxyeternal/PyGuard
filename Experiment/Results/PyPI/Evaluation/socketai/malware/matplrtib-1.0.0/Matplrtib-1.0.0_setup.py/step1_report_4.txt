{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package named 'Matplrtib' with specified metadata and a custom installation class that performs additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from variables (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and imports modules such as os, requests, and fernet. The potentially malicious source is inside the custom install class, where a decryption and execution occur.",
  "sinks": "The potentially malicious sink is the exec() call within the custom install class, which executes decrypted code that could perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code checks if the OS is Windows, then imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious code is decrypted.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes a heavily obfuscated custom install class name, a hardcoded Fernet key, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during installation. The description fields are nonsensical or obfuscated. The code also uses dynamic code execution with exec() based on decrypted data, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script with obfuscated class and description strings. The critical suspicious part is within the custom install class: it performs a runtime check for Windows OS, then imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an embedded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). This pattern suggests an embedded malicious payload that runs during installation, which is highly suspicious. The rest of the setup code appears typical for a Python package. The code does not contain any obvious backdoors or data exfiltration code outside the exec() call, but the encrypted payload indicates potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated and suspicious code that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior suggests potential malware or malicious intent, possibly used to run harmful payloads silently during package installation. The overall risk is high due to runtime code execution of encrypted content.",
