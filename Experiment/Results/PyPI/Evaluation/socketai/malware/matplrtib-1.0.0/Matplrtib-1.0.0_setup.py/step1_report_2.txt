  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom install command that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install command's run() method, which imports modules and executes decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes encrypted data, which could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a heavily obfuscated class name and variable names; execution of code via exec() on decrypted payload; encrypted data appears to be malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command class that, when run, checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it using exec(). The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The encrypted payload could contain malicious instructions. The overall structure suggests an embedded malicious backdoor that runs during installation. The obfuscation and encrypted payload are common tactics in malicious packages to hide harmful actions. The code does not contain obvious vulnerabilities, but the behavior of executing encrypted code at install time indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes potentially harmful code during installation on Windows systems. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and use of exec() strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
