{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with additional post-install behavior that collects and transmits system information.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain IP address; request to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded data; reading the current file path; opening and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs ('https://kotko.org') with encoded system data; writing to local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "On installation, system info such as IP, hostname, and path is collected, encoded in base64, and sent via an HTTP GET request to 'kotko.org'. Additionally, a local file is created or appended with a proof message.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes network requests during install, sending system info to external servers, creating a file with a suspicious name, and encoding data in base64 before transmission. The code uses 'atexit' to run post-install code, which is uncommon. Commented-out code suggests previous modifications.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes standard package configuration but injects malicious behavior through the '_post_install' function, which is registered to run after installation. This function collects the machine's IP, hostname, and file path, encodes this data in base64, and sends it to a suspicious domain 'kotko.org'. It also writes a proof message to a local file. The external requests and data exfiltration constitute malicious activity, indicating this package is designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior involving system data collection and exfiltration during installation, along with local file modification. This code appears to be malicious, aimed at spying or data theft. It should be considered highly malicious and unsafe to use.",
