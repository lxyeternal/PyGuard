{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that includes custom post-install behavior which communicates with external URLs and writes to a local file.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading 'README.md', reading local file paths, and environment info such as 'os.uname()'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'pocbykotko.txt' locally, sending data via GET request to 'kotko.org' with base64-encoded data, and fetching external IP address.",
  "flows": "Post-install function collects IP, host info, and path; encodes and sends this data to an external server; writes proof text to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system info and IP to an external domain, writing proof text to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', and the potential use of the setup script to execute malicious actions during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that registers a post-install function. This function writes a proof file locally and makes network requests to external domains, transmitting system info and a base64-encoded message. These actions are triggered during package installation, which is suspicious. The external communications could be malicious or for tracking purposes. No other malicious code such as reverse shells or data theft is present, but the external data transmission during install is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior potential by transmitting system information to an external domain during installation and writing a proof file locally. The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate data and execute side effects during setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
