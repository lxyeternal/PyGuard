  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including installation procedures and post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; reads files like 'pocbykotko.txt'; performs network requests via requests.get to external URLs; accesses environment and system info such as os.uname() and __file__.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains (api.ipify.org and kotko.org), writing to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt', and encoding/decoding data with base64 before sending over network.",
  "flows": "The script fetches IP address and system info, encodes data with base64, and sends it via HTTP GET requests to external domains during post-installation.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install function performs network requests to external domains and writes a file locally; it encodes and transmits system info without any clear user consent or validation. The function is registered to run at install time but is commented out in the setup call, so it may not execute. Usage of requests in post-install is suspicious, potentially for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is standard for packaging but includes a function '_post_install' that, when invoked, writes a proof file and sends system info (public IP, hostname, and path) to an external server. The function encodes the data in base64 and appends it to a URL, which is suspicious. Although the '_post_install' function is registered with 'atexit' and commented out at the end, its presence suggests potential malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration. The code does not sanitize inputs or validate responses, and the external requests could be used to gather system data covertly. No other malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are evident, but the network behavior and data handling are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious post-installation routine that collects and transmits system information to an external domain. This behavior is hidden within the package setup process and could be used for data exfiltration without user consent. The overall risk is moderate due to these suspicious network activities and file modifications, though no active backdoors or destructive actions are present.",
