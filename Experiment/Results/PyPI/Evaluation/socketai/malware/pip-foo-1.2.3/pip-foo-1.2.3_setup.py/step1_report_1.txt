{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package intended for distribution via PyPI, with some custom installation behavior that includes network requests and file modification.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md', executes network requests via 'requests.get', accesses system info with 'os.uname()', and reads/writes to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Sends base64-encoded data to an external URL ('https://kotko.org'), writes to local file 'pocbykotko.txt', and retrieves the system IP address.",
  "flows": "User installs the package, triggering '_post_install()' which collects system info, encodes it, and exfiltrates it via HTTP GET request; simultaneously writes a proof message to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The '_post_install()' function, registered via 'atexit', performs network activity and file modification during installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior for a package setup script. The code uses requests to send potentially sensitive system info to an external domain. The URL 'https://kotko.org' and parameters include encoded data; this pattern indicates data exfiltration. There is a commented-out '_post_install' call that suggests possible obfuscation or intent to hide activity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with typical setup script imports and configuration. However, during the installation process, the '_post_install()' function executes, which does the following: (1) creates or appends to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a proof message; (2) retrieves the public IP address via a network request; (3) gathers system hostname and current path; (4) encodes this information in base64; (5) sends it via a GET request to an external URL 'https://kotko.org' with parameters. The use of 'atexit.register' to trigger '_post_install()' during installation is unusual and suggests data exfiltration behavior. No direct malicious payloads like reverse shells or destructive actions are present, but the collection and transmission of system info without user consent is suspicious. The code does not perform any dangerous system modifications beyond writing a proof message. The network activity is suspicious given the context of a package setup, indicating possible malicious intent or data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains code that performs system information collection and exfiltration during installation, which is abnormal for such scripts. This behavior indicates malicious intent related to data theft or surveillance. The code's primary malicious feature is the unauthorized collection and sending of system info to an external server during package installation.",
