{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with an embedded post-installation script that exfiltrates system information.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain external IP; access to system hostname via os.uname(); reading file paths; requests to 'https://kotko.org' with encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs potentially transmitting sensitive data; writing to a file 'pocbykotko.txt' which could be used as a marker or backdoor indicator.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'new_install' class triggers '_post_install' which collects IP, hostname, and path data, encodes it, and sends it to a remote server, indicating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that transmits system data to an external server during installation; commented-out code and redundant imports; no apparent benign purpose for data collection and transmission; use of base64 encoding for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package configuration, but notably overrides the install command to perform malicious activities during installation. The '_post_install' function retrieves the external IP, system hostname, and package directory, encodes this information in base64, and sends it via a GET request to an external domain 'kotko.org'. Additionally, it writes a proof text 'proof bug by kotko' to a file. These behaviors indicate attempts to secretly collect and transmit sensitive environment and system data without user consent. The code does not contain obfuscated logic beyond standard encoding, but the malicious intent is clear in the data exfiltration process embedded in the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior aimed at covertly exfiltrating system information during installation, representing a high security risk. The core setup code appears legitimate, but the override of the install process with data collection and transmission makes this package highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
