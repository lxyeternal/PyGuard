{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure a Python package for distribution with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely executes package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The author and author_email fields are empty, which is not suspicious but noteworthy for completeness.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. All elements are standard for Python package configuration. The dependencies listed include common third-party libraries such as browser_cookie3, discordwebhook, robloxpy, and requests, which are legitimate for various functionalities. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities are present. The absence of author info might be a minor concern for package authenticity but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe to use within its intended context.",
