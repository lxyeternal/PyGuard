  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution, including dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is static configuration code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this static setup code.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'testingbrooasqa' appears nonsensical or obfuscated, but no malicious code is present. The author and email fields are empty, which could indicate incomplete or suspicious package info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for Python packaging. It imports setup and find_packages, defines a version, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. The dependencies include common third-party packages such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. The package name is unusual but not inherently malicious. No data handling, input/output, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual package name warrants further review outside this code context, but based solely on this script, it appears benign.",
