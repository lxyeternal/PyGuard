  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package setup for distribution.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and 'install_requires' list specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and dependency management; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from importing setup and find_packages, then calling setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; minimal code but includes potentially privacy-sensitive dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. The inclusion of 'discordwebhook' could suggest potential use in automated messaging or alerts, but by itself, it is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic are present. The script is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evident malicious behavior. While some dependencies could be used in potentially privacy-sensitive or automated tasks, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent or malware in this code. The lack of author information is noted but not suspicious per se.",
