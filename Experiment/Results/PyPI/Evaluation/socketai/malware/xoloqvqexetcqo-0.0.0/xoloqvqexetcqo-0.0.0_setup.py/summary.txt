  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and contains no malicious code or behavior. The main concern is the obfuscated or nonsensical package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent in a broader context. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscated score should be moderate due to the suspicious name. Overall, the package appears safe but warrants further review of its distribution source."
