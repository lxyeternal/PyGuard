{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'xoloqvqexetcqo', including its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and the list of dependencies from the 'install_requires' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous dependencies like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests' could be used maliciously if combined with malicious code, but the setup script itself does not execute them.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration loads dependencies, but does not execute or use them directly. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script simply defines a package setup with metadata and dependencies. It imports 'setuptools' and 'find_packages', sets a version string, and calls 'setup()' with package info and dependencies. No code execution, data processing, or network activity occurs here. The dependencies listed could be misused if malicious code is present elsewhere, but within this script, there are no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies without executing any suspicious operations.",
