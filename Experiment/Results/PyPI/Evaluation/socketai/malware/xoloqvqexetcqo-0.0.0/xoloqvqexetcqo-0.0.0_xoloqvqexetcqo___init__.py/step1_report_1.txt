{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract Roblox cookies and user information from the browser's stored cookies and then send this data to a Discord webhook, effectively acting as a credential stealer and information gatherer.",
  "sources": "The code reads cookies from various browser profiles (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) related to 'roblox.com' using the 'browser_cookie3' library. It also reads the user's IP address via an external API (api.ipify.org).",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to a Discord webhook URL via an HTTP POST request, containing sensitive Roblox account information and the Roblox security cookie.",
  "flows": "The code extracts cookies from the browser (source), verifies their validity, retrieves user data via Roblox API endpoints (additional data sources), then compiles and sends this data to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script operates as a credential stealer, collecting cookies and user info without user consent. The purpose appears malicious. The use of hardcoded webhook URL indicates it is designed for exfiltration. No obfuscation or encryption is present, and the code has a straightforward malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by defining functions to gather cookies from various browsers and filters for the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie. It then checks the cookie's validity via Roblox's API. Upon successful validation, it collects user information, including username, user ID, account age, Robux balance, premium status, friends count, and profile image. The script also obtains the IP address through an external API. All collected data, including the Roblox security cookie, is sent to a specified Discord webhook URL. The overall purpose is to harvest Roblox account credentials and associated data for malicious use, with no legitimate or benign functionality observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious credential logger designed to steal Roblox cookies and user information by extracting data from the user's browser and sending it to an attacker-controlled webhook. It exhibits clear malicious behavior with high potential harm, involving credential theft and privacy invasion.",
