{
  "purpose": "The script collects Roblox account cookies, user information, and IP address, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies via browser_cookie3 (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome), IP address request from api.ipify.org, and Roblox API endpoints for user info.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook POST request, sending cookie and user data, and potentially executing system commands via os.system.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browsers -> Cookie validity is checked -> User info is fetched from Roblox API -> Data is sent to webhook including cookies and IP.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie retrieval methods targeting '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, including hardcoded webhook URL, which could be malicious if misused. The script's purpose appears to be credential harvesting and user info collection. No obfuscated code, but the intent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules, notably 'browser_cookie3' for cookie access and 'requests' for network requests. It defines a function to log cookies from various browsers and retrieves '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies. It then checks the cookie validity using 'robloxpy.Utils.CheckCookie'. If invalid, it sends a warning to the webhook and exits. If valid, it fetches user info from Roblox API and related services, then posts a detailed message to a Discord webhook including the cookie and user data. The use of multiple cookie sources and direct data exfiltration indicates malicious intent focused on credential theft. The script does not obfuscate code or employ techniques typical of malware but is clearly designed for data theft. The inclusion of 'os.system' functions for command execution (though not used in current code) hints at possible further malicious extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to steal Roblox cookies and user data, then exfiltrate this information via Discord webhook. It uses multiple cookie sources and communicates sensitive data openly. Although it lacks obfuscation or malware-like activities such as system damage or reverse shells, it poses a significant security risk as a credential harvester. Its malicious intent is high, with potential for further malicious behavior if extended.",
