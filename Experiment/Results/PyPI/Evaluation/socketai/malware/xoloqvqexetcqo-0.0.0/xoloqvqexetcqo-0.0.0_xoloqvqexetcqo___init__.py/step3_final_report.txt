  "purpose": "Credential theft and data exfiltration of Roblox user info and cookies via webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chromium targeting 'roblox.com'. Roblox API for validation and info. External IP API.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Extraction of cookies -> validation -> user info retrieval -> exfiltration to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, straightforward malicious intent, hardcoded webhook, silent operation.",
  "analysis": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validates them, retrieves user info, IP address, and exfiltrates all data including the cookie to an external webhook. It operates silently without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The code contains no obfuscation or system damage commands. It is a credential logger designed for privacy invasion and account hijacking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Roblox users, exfiltrating sensitive data via a webhook. Its behavior is clearly malicious, with high potential for harm. The malware score should be set to 1, security risk to 1, and obfuscation to 0.",
