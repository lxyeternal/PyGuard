{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from the user's browser, verify their validity, and send detailed user information including the Roblox account details and IP address to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (via browser_cookie3 for various browsers), HTTP request to ipify.org for IP address, Roblox API endpoints for user info",
  "sinks": "Sending data to the Discord webhook URL, including cookies, Roblox user info, and IP address",
  "flows": "Browser cookies are read as sources; if valid, account info is fetched from Roblox API; data is then formatted and sent via webhook (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The script collects cookies silently, verifies their validity, and exfiltrates detailed user and system data without user consent. It uses hardcoded webhook URL. The cookie logger targets Roblox cookies specifically. No obfuscation but malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to silently gather Roblox cookies from multiple browsers. It verifies the cookie's validity via Roblox API. If valid, it proceeds to collect detailed account information, including user ID, Robux, friends count, account age, and IP address. All this information is then sent to an external Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user data. The code contains no obfuscation, but it performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration without user consent. It does not contain malware such as backdoors or system damage commands, but its malicious purpose is clear due to stealthy data harvesting and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious as it stealthily collects and exfiltrates sensitive user data, including cookies, IP address, and account info, without user consent. It constitutes a privacy violation and could be used for malicious purposes such as account hijacking or further exploits.",
