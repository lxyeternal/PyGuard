{
  "purpose": "The script collects Roblox account cookies and user information, then exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for 'roblox.com', and the Roblox account info via HTTP requests to Roblox APIs.",
  "sinks": "Sending account cookies and user information to a remote Discord webhook via HTTP POST requests.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browser storage -> cookies are validated with Roblox API -> account info is retrieved -> data, including cookies and user info, is sent to a Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears designed solely for stealing Roblox cookies and user data without user consent; the variable names and overall purpose suggest malicious intent. The code exfiltrates sensitive data to an external webhook, which is a malicious behavior. No obfuscation or encryption is used for data transmission, indicating intent to harvest data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for cookie access, HTTP requests, and system commands, then attempts to retrieve cookies from multiple browsers specifically for 'roblox.com'. It only proceeds if a valid Roblox cookie is found, otherwise it reports an expired cookie to the webhook and exits. Once validated, it gathers detailed user info from Roblox API endpoints, including UserID, RAP, friends count, age, creation date, profile links, and headshot. All sensitive data, including the Roblox cookie, is then sent to a Discord webhook, clearly indicating data exfiltration. The script is straightforward in harvesting and transmitting user data without any clear user consent, which is characteristic of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox accounts, collecting cookies and personal information and exfiltrating to an external server. Its purpose is malicious, aiming to compromise user accounts, with no legitimate or benign functionality apparent. The script demonstrates malicious behavior with high confidence, as it actively harvests and leaks sensitive data.",
