  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their findings with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate them, retrieve user info, and exfiltrate all data to a Discord webhook.\n- It does not perform any obfuscation or encryption.\n- The webhook URL is hardcoded.\n- The code operates silently, with no user consent.\n- The primary behavior is clearly malicious: credential theft and data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Credential stealer, exfiltrates Roblox cookies and info.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies from multiple browsers using `browser_cookie3`.\n- **Sinks:** Sends data to Discord webhook.\n- **Flow:** Cookie extraction → validation → data collection → exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, straightforward malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code's behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious credential logger.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **SecurityRisk:** 1\n\n**Score justification:** The high malware and risk scores are justified. The code is designed explicitly for credential theft, with no benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API.\n- **Sinks:** Webhook exfiltration.\n- **Flow:** Similar to report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** Designed solely for stealing data, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code's behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Cookie stealer targeting Roblox.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **SecurityRisk:** 1\n\n**Score justification:** Consistent with the code's behavior; high scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Extracts Roblox cookies and info, sends to webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies, Roblox API, IP address.\n- **Sinks:** Sends data to webhook.\n- **Flow:** Similar to above.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, malicious intent clear.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code's functionality.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious data exfiltration.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0 (This is inconsistent; the code is clearly malicious, so a malware score of 0 seems understated.)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.9\n\n**Issue:** The malware score here is 0, which contradicts the malicious nature of the code. It should be closer to 1.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies, IP, Roblox API.\n- **Sinks:** Webhook, with mention of potential system commands via `os.system`.\n- **Flow:** Same as others.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses multiple cookie retrieval methods, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Data collection and exfiltration are malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Credential harvesting and data exfiltration.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0.75 (indicates some malicious behavior, but not full malware)\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.9\n\n**Note:** The malware score of 0.75 seems reasonable, as the code is malicious but not destructive malware like a backdoor or ransomware.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Roblox cookie logger, exfiltration.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies.\n- **Sinks:** Webhook.\n- **Flow:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Highly malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **SecurityRisk:** 1\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is **definitely malicious**, designed for credential theft and data exfiltration.\n- The **malware score** should be **close to 1** for all reports, as the behavior is malicious.\n- The **security risk** should also be **high (close to 1)**, which is consistent.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n**In particular, Report 3's malware score of 0 is inconsistent with the code's behavior and should be increased to 1.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 1 (all reports should reflect this)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 1 (high, due to credential theft and privacy invasion)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a clear malicious credential logger with high potential harm. The scores should uniformly reflect this, with malware and security risk scores at 1, and obfuscation at 0.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 1  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the behavior and intent of the code.",
