{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for loading, handling, and visualizing PHOENIX stellar spectra and spectra grids, primarily for astrophysical research and data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from local FITS files, downloads spectral data from an FTP server if specified, and retrieves user inputs via Bokeh sliders and toggles within the dashboard.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted user interactions could potentially modify spectral data displayed in the dashboard, but there are no explicit sinks that perform insecure data handling or network transmission of sensitive information. The only network activity involves downloading spectral data, which is standard and controlled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads or downloads into spectral objects, which are then manipulated (e.g., broadened, shifted) based on user input from sliders/toggles, with the visualized spectrum updated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The download URL is explicitly from an FTP server, which is standard for spectral data retrieval. The code uses suppression of warnings for deprecation and runtime warnings, which is common in scientific code but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily involves data handling, file I/O, and visualization setup. It loads spectral data from specified files or URLs, constructs spectral objects, and provides an interactive dashboard for spectral analysis. No suspicious or malicious code, such as system commands, network exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The network download is controlled and explicitly stated. The code appears to be designed for scientific purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific data processing and visualization tool for stellar spectra, with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs standard operations related to astrophysics data analysis, with proper handling of data sources and user interactions. No security risks or malware are detected.",
