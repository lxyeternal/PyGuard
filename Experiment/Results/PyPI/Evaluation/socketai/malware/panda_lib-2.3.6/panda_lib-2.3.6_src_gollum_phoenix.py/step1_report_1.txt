{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for loading, managing, and visualizing stellar spectra, specifically PHOENIX models, for astrophysical analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (teff, logg, Z), filesystem paths for local files, URLs for downloads, and spectrum data from imported modules. Also reads FITS files for wavelength and flux data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include spectrum visualizations via Bokeh, spectrum data manipulation, and interactive dashboards. No apparent data leakage or network transmission of sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence file selection and data loading. Spectrum data is processed and displayed interactively. Sliders and toggles update spectrum visualization, but no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; download functionality is marked experimental but does not contain malicious code. Warnings are suppressed for specific known issues, which is typical in scientific code. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing PHOENIX stellar spectra, including loading from local or remote sources, constructing a spectral grid, and visualizing spectra interactively. It imports multiple scientific and visualization libraries, with no suspicious network activity or file operations beyond expected data loading. The download feature is noted as WIP and does not contain malicious network code. The visualization functions create plots and UI controls for data exploration without transmitting or executing untrusted code. Overall, the code is consistent with scientific data analysis workflows and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific library for spectral data handling and visualization. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. No security risks such as data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
