{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling, visualizing, and interacting with PHOENIX stellar spectra, including downloading models, constructing spectral grids, and displaying interactive dashboards.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (teff, logg, Z, path, download), filesystem (os.path.exists, fits.open), network (download from FTP site), internal class attributes, sliders, toggle widgets",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network transmissions, file writing, or system modifications are present in the code",
  "flows": "Input parameters and user interactions update spectral data via sliders and toggles, affecting spectral visualization but not leading to external data flow or malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily handles data processing and visualization. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration routines observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various scientific and visualization libraries, defines classes for handling PHOENIX spectral models, and provides an interactive dashboard for spectral analysis. Download mechanisms are properly encapsulated, with assertions and warnings for missing files or network issues. The code's data flow is centered around spectra manipulation and visualization. No network communications beyond downloading files are present, and no code appears to perform unintended actions such as system modification or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for scientific spectral data analysis with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It adheres to expected functionality for astrophysical data handling and visualization, with no suspicious patterns or activities.",
