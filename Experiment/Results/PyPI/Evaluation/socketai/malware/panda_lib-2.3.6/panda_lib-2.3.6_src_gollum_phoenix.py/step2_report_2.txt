  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes classes for managing PHOENIX spectra, reading local files, or downloading via FTP (marked as WIP). Reads FITS files for wavelength and flux data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Spectrum visualization and data manipulation; no external data transmission beyond data loading.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, warnings suppressed for known issues—typical in scientific code.\n- **Analysis:** No network activity beyond standard data loading, no malicious code, no dynamic execution, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior, very high confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues. Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, includes FTP download, user interactions for spectrum visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User inputs modify spectra; no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; FTP is a common data source.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; FTP download could be exploited but appears legitimate here.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low malware risk (0.1), security risk slightly higher (0.2) due to FTP download.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The malware score might be slightly conservative but acceptable given context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages spectral data, downloads from FTP, user interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Spectrum modifications via sliders, no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, warnings suppressed.\n- **Analysis:** Standard scientific data handling; no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with data loading, FTP download, visualization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User interactions modify spectra; no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, warnings suppressed, FTP source is standard.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, malware score: 0, security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, FTP download, user interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Spectrum updates based on user input; no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, warnings suppressed.\n- **Analysis:** Standard scientific code, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, malware score: 0, security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 or very close to 0. Given the code is scientific, handles data loading, visualization, and user interaction without executing external commands or transmitting data maliciously, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations, but generally low, reflecting the use of FTP downloads and data handling typical in scientific code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, scientific, and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — low, mainly due to FTP download, which is standard but could be a vector if misused.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The download via FTP is standard for scientific data; no suspicious activity is evident.\n- The interactive visualization is typical for data exploration.\n\n**Summary:** The overall security assessment aligns with the reports. The code is safe, with negligible malware risk, no obfuscation, and low security risk primarily due to data download sources.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative estimate reflects the code's scientific purpose and lack of malicious features.",
