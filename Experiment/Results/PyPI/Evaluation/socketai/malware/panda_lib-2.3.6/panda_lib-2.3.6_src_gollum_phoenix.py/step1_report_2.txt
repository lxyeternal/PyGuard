{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to load, manage, and visualize PHOENIX stellar spectra, including fetching data from local files or FTP sources, and interactive visualization with Bokeh.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local files specified by 'path' and 'wl_file', as well as FTP URLs if 'download' is True. User inputs for sliders and toggle buttons in the interactive dashboard also serve as sources.",
  "sinks": "The code updates data sources for visualization, modifies spectrum objects based on user input, and potentially fetches data over the internet. No data is directly written to external systems or files as part of this code.",
  "flows": "User interactions (slider and toggle inputs) trigger spectrum modifications, including rotational broadening, RV shifts, and continuum fitting, which update the visualized spectrum. Data flows from inputs to spectrum objects, then to visualization sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code handles data downloading via FTP, but this is standard and does not imply malicious intent. The suppression of warnings appears typical for scientific packages. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages spectral data, providing mechanisms to load spectra from files or download via FTP, and create an interactive visualization dashboard. It uses common scientific and visualization libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells, are detected. The FTP download could be exploited in a malicious context, but here it appears to be a benign data source. The interactive UI is designed for data visualization and analysis, not for executing arbitrary or harmful commands. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found, and the code adheres to expected scientific programming patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard scientific data management and visualization script for stellar spectra, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The FTP download feature should be used cautiously, but as implemented, it seems intended for legitimate data retrieval. Overall, the code is safe with a low malware likelihood.",
