{
  "purpose": "Manage, analyze, and visualize PHOENIX stellar spectra, including data loading from local files or remote FTP sources, and providing interactive visualization dashboards.",
  "sources": "FITS files for wavelength and flux data, FTP URLs for spectral data download, user input via sliders and toggles in the visualization dashboard.",
  "sinks": "Spectrum visualization outputs, spectrum manipulation and updates within the interactive dashboard; no external data transmission or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (teff, logg, Z) influence data loading; user interactions (sliders, toggles) modify spectra; spectra are visualized and updated dynamically within the dashboard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, warnings suppressed for known benign issues, FTP download source is explicitly noted as 'WIP' or 'experimental'.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured scientific software for stellar spectra management. It loads data from local or FTP sources, performs spectrum manipulations, and provides interactive visualization. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The FTP download is standard in astrophysics workflows. Warnings suppression is typical in scientific packages. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration routines are detected. The code does not contain obfuscation or misleading constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured scientific library for stellar spectra analysis and visualization. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk associated with external data sources is typical for scientific workflows and does not constitute a security threat.",
