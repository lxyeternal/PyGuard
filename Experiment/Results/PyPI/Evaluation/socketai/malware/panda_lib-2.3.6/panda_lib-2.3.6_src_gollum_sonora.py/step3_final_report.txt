  "purpose": "Classes and functions for loading, manipulating, and visualizing spectral data from the Sonora model grids, primarily for scientific analysis and interactive visualization.",
  "sources": "Local CSV files containing spectral data, user input via sliders/buttons for spectrum manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; all data handling and visualization are local in-memory operations.",
  "flows": "Reading spectral data from local files; user interactions modify spectra in-memory; visualization updates accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; warnings suppressed but this is a known operational practice.",
  "analysis": "The code loads spectral data from local files based on specified parameters, constructs spectrum objects, and provides an interactive dashboard for visualization and spectrum manipulation. There is no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior. The suppression of warnings is a standard practice to hide known library issues, not malicious intent. The code structure is transparent and adheres to scientific data processing norms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific spectral analysis and visualization utility with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It relies on local data files and user interactions for spectrum manipulation, with no network communication or hidden behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
