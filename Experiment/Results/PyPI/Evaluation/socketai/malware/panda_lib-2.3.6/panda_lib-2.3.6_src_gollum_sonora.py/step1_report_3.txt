{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to load, process, and visualize precomputed synthetic spectra of brown dwarfs and gas giant planets from the Sonora model grid, including interactive dashboards for parameter exploration.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from local CSV files containing spectral data; user input is gathered via sliders and buttons in the interactive dashboard.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are evident; the code generates plots and UI elements. It does not perform network communications or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "User inputs via sliders/buttons influence spectrum selection, manipulation, and visualization within the dashboard. Data from local CSV files feeds into spectrum objects that are visualized, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward scientific visualization tool; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected. Warnings are suppressed for known issues in external dependencies. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard scientific and visualization libraries, defines classes for handling spectral data, loads spectral data from local files, and provides an interactive Bokeh dashboard for spectrum analysis. The data sources are local files, not untrusted network inputs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or system damage. All functions relate to spectral data processing and visualization, with no suspicious code patterns or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific data visualization tool for precomputed spectra, with no malicious intent detected. It handles local data files and provides interactive plotting, with no indications of sabotage, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
