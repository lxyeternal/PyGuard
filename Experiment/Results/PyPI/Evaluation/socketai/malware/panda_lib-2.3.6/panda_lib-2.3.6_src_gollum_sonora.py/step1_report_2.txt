  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for handling, visualizing, and manipulating precomputed synthetic spectra of brown dwarfs and gas giant planets, specifically from the Sonora models. It enables reading spectra, creating spectral grids, and interactive visualization dashboards.",
  "sources": "Reading spectrum data from local files using read_csv, user inputs via sliders and buttons in the interactive dashboard, and external data via Spectrum1D objects for overlay and manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present that send untrusted data externally; the code primarily reads local files and displays data within an interactive visualization. The only network-related activity is through Bokeh's show() function which serves the visualization within a local notebook or server context.",
  "flows": "User manipulates sliders/buttons which update spectral data (source to sink), but all data modifications occur locally within the environment. Reading data from local files is controlled, and visualization outputs are displayed locally without network transmission of sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are detected. No code injections, data leaks, or suspicious external communications are evident. Usage of warnings filters is benign, addressing known library issues. The code relies on standard scientific Python packages, and no obfuscated language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads spectral data from local files, constructs spectral models, and provides an interactive visualization dashboard. It utilizes well-known libraries (os, numpy, pandas, bokeh) without employing any suspicious or malicious techniques. The data flow is controlled, and there are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or external command execution. The only potential concern might be the serving of the dashboard via Bokeh's show() function, but this is a standard visualization approach. No hidden backdoors, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a scientific visualization and data manipulation tool for astronomical spectra. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage elements. All data interactions are local, and the code leverages common, reputable libraries for data processing and visualization. No indicators of malware or security risks are identified.",
