{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to load, manipulate, and visualize precomputed synthetic spectra of brown dwarfs and gas giant planets from the Sonora grid, mainly for scientific analysis and plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files containing spectral data from local file paths; uses input parameters such as teff, logg, metallicity to locate files; accepts external Spectrum1D data for overlay in visualization.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that send data over the network, write to external systems, or leak data; uses data from local files and user inputs only for processing and visualization.",
  "flows": "Reads spectral data from local files based on parameter inputs; processes and stores spectral data internally; displays data interactively via Bokeh dashboard. User inputs (sliders, buttons) modify spectral parameters but do not transmit or exfiltrate data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code includes visualization and user interaction features, which are typical for scientific tools. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads spectral data from local files based on model parameters, processes the data, and provides interactive visualization features using Bokeh. It performs standard file existence checks, data masking, and conversions. No code indicates malicious intent such as data theft, remote command execution, or network communication for malicious purposes. The interactive dashboard only operates locally or on the specified notebook URL. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident from the functions, classes, or flow control. The only potential concern is the use of external visualization libraries and interactive features, which are typical for scientific visualization and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific analysis tool for modeling and visualizing spectra from the Sonora grid. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It loads data from local files, provides visualization, and accepts user inputs for parameter adjustments. The overall security risk is very low.",
