{
  "purpose": "To provide classes for handling and processing precomputed telluric spectra from skycalc and TelFit sources, enabling spectrum manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading spectrum data from external URLs or local files via pandas.read_csv; input file paths provided through constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data that could cause data leaks or system effects. No network transmission or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external file sources into pandas DataFrames, then into spectrum objects after unit conversion and filtering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Warnings are suppressed for known issues. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines spectrum classes that load data from specified paths, possibly URLs, then process and convert wavelengths to Angstroms, filtering by wavelength range. The use of pandas.read_csv with external URLs does not execute code but reads data. No indications of malicious actions, such as system access, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. Warning suppression is justified by known library issues. The method for air-to-vacuum conversion appears mathematically correct and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as spectrum data loaders and processors with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It safely reads spectrum data, performs conversions, and provides spectrum objects. No security risks are apparent.",
