{
  "purpose": "The code loads spectral data from URLs or local files, processes it, and creates spectrum objects for scientific analysis.",
  "sources": "read_csv calls reading from specified URLs or local file paths, using pandas.read_csv with delimiters and column names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration; the code does not send data over the network or modify system files.",
  "flows": "Data is read from external sources, converted (wavelength units), filtered by wavelength range, and passed into spectrum objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Warnings are suppressed for known benign issues.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific data loading and processing, with no dynamic code execution or malicious logic. External URLs are used for demo data, and the physics-based conversions are legitimate. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The suppression of warnings is justified. The data flow is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign scientific data loader with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data sources, which are known demo URLs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context.",
