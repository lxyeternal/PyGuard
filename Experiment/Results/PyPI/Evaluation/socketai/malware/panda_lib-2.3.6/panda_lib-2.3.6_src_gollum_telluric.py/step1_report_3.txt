{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for loading and handling precomputed telluric spectra for astronomical data analysis, specifically from skycalc and TelFit models.",
  "sources": "The code reads spectral data files from URLs or local paths using pandas.read_csv, including a default URL for demo spectra.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally without writing or transmitting untrusted data externally, but it may load potentially untrusted files or URLs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pandas.read_csv inputs (from URL or file path) into dataframes, then through transformations to spectral_axis and flux attributes, with no external output or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Warnings are suppressed for known Astropy deprecations and runtime warnings. The code includes no obfuscated constructs or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and external scientific packages. It loads spectral data from specified paths or URLs, processes the data (unit conversions, filtering), and initializes spectrum objects. The conversion from air to vacuum spectrum uses a known formula based on Morton (1991). No malicious or suspicious operations are evident, and no external data exfiltration or harmful system modification is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific data processing code with no malicious intent. It loads spectral data, processes it, and provides methods for spectrum conversions. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
