  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly increasing the overall risk score to 0.2 accounts for limited context and structural ambiguities, but overall, the security posture remains low risk."
