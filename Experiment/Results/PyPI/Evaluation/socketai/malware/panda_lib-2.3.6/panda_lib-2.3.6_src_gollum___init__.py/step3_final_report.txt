  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, standard libraries, data processing functions, network or file sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, data exfiltration points, environment variables, output streams.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) to sinks (network, files), with no suspicious or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious routines identified; some structural ambiguity noted but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security issues. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature of the code snippets. Confidence levels are high (0.7-0.9), appropriate for the evidence. The reports are thorough and cautious, with no false positives or overlooked signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Slightly increasing the overall risk score to 0.2 accounts for limited context and structural ambiguities, but overall, the security posture remains low risk.",
