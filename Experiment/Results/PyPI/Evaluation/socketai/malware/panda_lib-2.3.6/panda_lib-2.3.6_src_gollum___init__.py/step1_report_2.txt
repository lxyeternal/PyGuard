  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific operation or computation, but the exact intent cannot be determined due to the lack of explicit comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, file reads, or user input, possibly through functions or external modules.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data may reach network calls, file system writes, or system commands, potentially leading to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file system, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are detected. Unusual language features or misuse of modules are not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to import standard or third-party modules without unusual patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and formatting are straightforward, with no obfuscated or encrypted sections. Usage of environment variables or input is typical. No hardcoded secrets or unusual control flow are detected. Without further context or more code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no indications of malware, data theft, or supply chain attacks. The overall security risk is low.",
