  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'panda_lib' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed at the beginning; standard setuptools setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code which may perform arbitrary actions; package installation and metadata declaration.",
  "flows": "Decoded base64 payload executes arbitrary code, then proceeds to run setuptools.setup() which defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() combined with compile() and base64 decoding to execute hidden code; potential obfuscation. No explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious package data found.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setuptools and then executes dynamically decoded code from a base64 string. The decoded code imports 'tempfile', 'warnings', 'sys', and 'os' modules, and makes network requests to 'http://54.167.173.26/inetq/i09xHUvmQ245P8bK'—which is suspicious. These network calls are made via 'http' (unencrypted), and the decoded payload appears to be designed to fetch and possibly execute remote code or perform malicious actions. The setup() function is standard for packaging but is preceded by obfuscated code, which is suspicious. The package configuration itself appears benign, but the initial payload’s behavior is potentially malicious, likely used to fetch malicious scripts or exfiltrate data.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of external code from a remote server, indicating malicious intent. The presence of network activity to an untrusted IP and dynamic code execution raises significant security concerns. The overall security risk is high due to the initial obfuscated payload executing arbitrary network code before proceeding with package setup.",
