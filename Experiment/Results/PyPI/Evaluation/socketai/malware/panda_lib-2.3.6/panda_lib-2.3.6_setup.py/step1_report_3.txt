  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'panda_lib' with specified metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed at the beginning of the script; standard setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "The decoded and executed code; potentially executes arbitrary code that could perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Base64 decode -> compile -> execute -> import modules -> perform HTTP request and execute code based on response -> setup package.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code at the start using base64 decoding and dynamic execution; code appears to fetch and execute code from a URL, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated code that decodes a base64 string, compiles it, and executes it dynamically. The decoded code imports modules for system and URL handling, makes an HTTP request to a remote server, and executes the response as code. This behavior is suspicious as it can allow remote code execution, potentially malicious. The rest of the script is a standard setuptools setup configuration, which appears benign. The presence of remote code fetching and execution constitutes a significant security risk, indicative of malicious intent. This pattern matches common obfuscation techniques used in malicious packages to hide harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that fetches and executes remote code at install time, representing a high security risk. The rest of the setup code is typical for a Python package, but the initial obfuscated segment is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
