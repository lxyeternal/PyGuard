  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated remote code fetching and execution, confirmed by network requests to untrusted IPs and dynamic code execution. The scores should be set to maximum (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 1.0, security risk: 1.0) to reflect the severity. This package should be considered malicious and handled accordingly."
