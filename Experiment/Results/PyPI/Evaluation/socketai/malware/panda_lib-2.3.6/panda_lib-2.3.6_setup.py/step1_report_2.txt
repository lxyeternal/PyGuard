  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'panda_lib', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded strings and decodes embedded base64-encoded data to execute dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes arbitrary code via exec() after decoding base64 payload; could lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded data is compiled and executed dynamically, which can run malicious code if the payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded base64 data indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent. No other suspicious activities are visible.",
  "analysis": "The initial import statement uses a semicolon to execute a block of code that imports base64, decodes a base64-encoded string, compiles it, and executes it via exec(). The base64 string is an embedded payload that is decoded and run dynamically. This pattern is suspicious and typical of obfuscated or malicious code. The rest of the code is a standard setuptools setup script with no apparent malicious activity, but the embedded dynamic code execution raises a red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic execution of code via exec() on a base64 payload, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The rest of the script appears to be a normal package setup. Due to the embedded decoded code, there is a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
