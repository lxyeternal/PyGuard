  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an interactive spectral visualization dashboard with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, but justified given the code's nature. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly notes that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slightly elevated security risk score is reasonable, considering the code creates an interactive UI that could potentially be misused if embedded in a malicious environment, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard visualization class for stellar spectra, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Comments:** The report emphasizes that the code performs spectrum visualization and parameter adjustments locally, with no suspicious behaviors. The confidence is high (1), and the scores are consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs an interactive spectral grid visualization, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — similar to previous reports, slightly elevated but justified given the UI and spectrum processing.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms no network activity or malicious code. The code manipulates spectral data internally, consistent with its purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, a spectral visualization tool with user interactions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no external data transfer or suspicious activity.\n- **Comments:** The report notes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is for scientific visualization only.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines a spectral grid class with visualization features, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by standard practices and lack of external network activity.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms the code's benign purpose, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, justified by the interactive nature but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The overall security risk is low, and the code appears to be a legitimate scientific visualization tool.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to UI components but no external threats.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation, serving a legitimate scientific purpose.",
