{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing and visualizing an experimental PHOENIX spectral grid, including an interactive dashboard for spectral analysis and parameter manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes external Spectrum1D-like objects passed to the show_dashboard method, and internal slider/toggle widget interactions that modify spectral parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code generates plots using Bokeh and updates spectra data in response to widget interactions, but does not write data externally, send data over networks, or invoke external commands.",
  "flows": "User interactions (slider/toggle adjustments) update spectral parameters via callback functions that modify the spectral data and visualization; no external data transmission or file access is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code relies on standard plotting libraries (Bokeh) and numerical manipulations; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a visualization interface built with Bokeh for spectral data, with callback functions that modify spectral parameters based on user input. It performs spectrum normalization, shifting, broadening, and overlaying data without any network communication or data exfiltration. The spectral manipulations use established physics models; no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be for scientific visualization purposes only, with no hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a spectral visualization tool with user-controlled spectral modifications. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code's intent appears benign, focused on scientific analysis. No malware or security risks are identified.",
