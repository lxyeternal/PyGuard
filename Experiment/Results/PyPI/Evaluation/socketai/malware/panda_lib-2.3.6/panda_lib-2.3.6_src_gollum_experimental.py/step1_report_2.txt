{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for visualizing and interacting with an experimental PHOENIX stellar spectral grid, including sliders and toggles for spectral parameter adjustments and visualization.",
  "sources": "Data is read from self attributes (like self[0].flux and self[0].wavelength), user inputs through sliders and toggles, and external Spectrum1D data provided to the show_dashboard method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data could influence spectrum visualization; however, no direct data leaks or harmful data exfiltration are present. No external sinks like network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "User interactions with sliders/toggles update spectrum parameters (source-to-sink: spec_source data updates), which then update visualizations. Data inputs from Spectrum1D objects are processed and visualized but do not flow into any malicious sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are observed. The code performs typical data visualization setup with no obfuscated language features or misleading variable names. No malicious or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a visualization class that uses Bokeh to create an interactive spectral grid. It reads spectral data from internal attributes and optional user data, then allows parameter adjustments via sliders and toggles. The code performs spectrum normalization, shifting, and broadening for visualization purposes. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious system commands are present. The functions involve spectrum processing and visualization, with callbacks updating spectra based on user input. All data processing appears benign and relevant to spectral visualization, with no indicators of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization tool for stellar spectra with user-interactive adjustments. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain sabotage. The code appears safe and intended for scientific visualization purposes.",
