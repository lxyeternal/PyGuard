{
  "purpose": "The code defines an experimental PHOENIX spectrum grid with an interactive visualization dashboard for stellar spectra modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'gollum.phoenix', use of getLogger(__name__), user-provided 'data' parameter in show_dashboard.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling is internal, with no network or file I/O; visualization rendering is local and does not involve untrusted data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' parameter into the plotting functions, with spectrum data being manipulated and passed through various spectrum transformations; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code uses standard plotting libraries (Bokeh), spectrum processing, and UI controls. No obfuscation or malware-like behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs an interactive dashboard for stellar spectra visualization, with spectrum transformations such as normalization, rv-shift, and rotational broadening. All operations are performed locally in memory with no network or file access that could facilitate malicious activity. The code adheres to typical data processing and visualization patterns in astronomy applications. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified, and the code appears to serve its intended purpose of spectrum visualization and modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, intended for spectral data visualization and modeling. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks is found.",
