{
  "purpose": "A spectral visualization and manipulation tool for stellar spectra, providing interactive dashboards and spectrum processing features.",
  "sources": "Internal spectral data (self[0]), user input spectra, class attributes for parameter points.",
  "sinks": "Local visualization outputs, spectrum data updates; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "User interactions (sliders, toggles) modify spectrum parameters; callbacks update spectrum data in real-time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard spectrum processing methods (normalize, tilt, rv_shift, rotational_broaden) and visualization via Bokeh. All operations are local, with no external data leaks or malicious behaviors. The code structure is straightforward, readable, and intended for scientific visualization. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign spectral visualization tool with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard spectrum processing and visualization locally, with no external network activity or suspicious behaviors.",
