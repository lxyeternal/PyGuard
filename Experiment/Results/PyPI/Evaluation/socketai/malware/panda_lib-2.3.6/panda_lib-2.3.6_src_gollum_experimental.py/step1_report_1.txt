{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interactive visualization dashboard for a spectral model grid, allowing users to manipulate stellar parameters and visualize the resulting spectra.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include the 'data' parameter for overlay spectra, and the class attributes such as self[0].wavelength and self[0].flux for spectral data. Environment variables or external inputs are not explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted. The code generates a visualization and UI components locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from spectral data objects into visualization components; user interactions update spectral parameters and spectra via callback functions. No data is transmitted externally or stored outside the local environment.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes comprehensive interactive visualization code, which is typical for such applications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration methods are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports spectral modeling tools and visualization libraries to create an interactive dashboard for stellar spectra. It manipulates spectral data internally, providing sliders and toggles for parameter adjustments. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or system modification. The code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool tailored for astrophysical spectral analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, specialized visualization tool for stellar spectra with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious network activities, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall security risk is low.",
