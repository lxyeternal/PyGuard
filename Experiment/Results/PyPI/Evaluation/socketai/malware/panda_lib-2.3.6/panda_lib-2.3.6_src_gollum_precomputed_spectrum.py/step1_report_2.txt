{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'PrecomputedSpectrum' for handling, manipulating, and analyzing spectral data, primarily for astrophysical applications, including normalization, broadening, shifting, resampling, and plotting spectra.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from spectrum inputs (self.wavelength, self.flux), metadata, and external libraries. It also imports modules like numpy, scipy, astropy, and specutils.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'log.info' statements which output warnings; however, these are benign. No code explicitly writes data to external sources, network, or files. No use of subprocess, os.system, or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from spectrum input data through processing methods (resampling, broadening, shifting, normalization), with no external data or untrusted input sources actively processed in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code ignores specific warnings and has a straightforward structure. The only potential concern is the use of 'deepcopy' and 'np.convolve', but these are standard practices. The import of 'apply_numpy_mask' from 'gollum.utilities' is external; without its implementation, it cannot be assessed, but its usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides spectral manipulation functions with proper use of scientific libraries. Warnings are suppressed for known issues with 'astropy'. No external data or commands are executed. No malicious functions or data leaks are evident. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications. The focus is on physics-based data processing, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a scientific spectral analysis module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears well-structured and uses standard scientific computing practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Minor warnings are suppressed for known library issues, which is common in scientific code.",
