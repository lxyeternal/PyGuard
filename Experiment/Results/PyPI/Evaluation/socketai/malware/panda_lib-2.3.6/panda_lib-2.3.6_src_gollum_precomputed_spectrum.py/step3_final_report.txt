{
  "purpose": "A scientific library for handling precomputed spectral data, providing methods for normalization, broadening, shifting, resampling, and analysis of spectra.",
  "sources": "Reads data from internal attributes such as self.wavelength and self.flux; imports external libraries for numerical and scientific computations.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network connections, or file I/O; primarily processes data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input attributes (wavelength, flux) through processing methods (e.g., resampling, broadening) without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of known warnings related to library deprecations; no suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured spectral data container extending Spectrum1D, with methods for normalization, broadening, shifting, and fitting. It uses standard scientific libraries and suppresses specific warnings for known issues. No network activity, external data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. External utility 'apply_numpy_mask' is imported but not suspicious. The code's purpose is scientific data processing, and it does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific spectral analysis library with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The suppression of warnings is typical in scientific software and does not indicate malicious intent. External dependencies appear benign. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
