{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for handling precomputed spectral data, including operations like normalization, shifting, resampling, broadening, and fitting.",
  "sources": "The code reads spectral data from attributes like self.wavelength and self.flux, and imports modules for scientific computation and plotting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data over network connections, write to files, or access external systems. No sink functions or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from spectral attributes into various processing functions (normalization, broadening, shifting, fitting). The methods manipulate and return new spectra; no external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are identified. The code relies on standard scientific libraries and has no suspicious file I/O or network activity. It ignores specific warnings for known issues, which is typical in scientific software.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured spectral data handler with methods for common spectral operations. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. It mainly performs mathematical transformations and plotting, using reputable libraries like astropy, scipy, and specutils. It explicitly ignores certain warnings and issues informative logs when velocity sampling appears non-uniform, which is benign. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The functions are consistent with scientific data processing and do not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific spectral data processing module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and performs typical spectral analysis tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
