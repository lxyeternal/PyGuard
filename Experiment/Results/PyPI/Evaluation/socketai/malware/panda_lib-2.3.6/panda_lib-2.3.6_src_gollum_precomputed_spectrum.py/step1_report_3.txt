{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling precomputed spectral data, providing methods for normalization, resampling, broadening, shifting, and fitting spectral features, primarily for astronomical spectral analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include spectral wavelength and flux data, and external parameters such as velocity, resolving power, and blackbody temperature. Data reading occurs indirectly via class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks involve spectral manipulations such as convolution, resampling, shifting, dividing by models, and fitting, but no direct data leakage or untrusted data outputs are observed.",
  "flows": "Input spectra are processed through various transformations (resampling, broadening, shifting). The spectral data flows from input attributes to modified spectra, with internal calculations and model fitting. No external data flows, network communications, or file I/O are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code ignores specific Astropy warnings, which is typical in astronomical code to suppress deprecation notices but could mask underlying issues. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or backdoors are evident. The code is straightforward with standard scientific computations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured spectral analysis class extending Spectrum1D, providing methods for spectrum normalization, broadening, shifting, resampling, and fitting. It uses trusted scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, astropy, specutils). There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration. Suppressing warnings is common in scientific code to avoid clutter but does not suggest malicious intent. The code performs legitimate spectral data manipulations without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific tool for spectral analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It focuses on data processing and fitting, using standard scientific libraries and methods. No malicious signals or malware indicators are present.",
