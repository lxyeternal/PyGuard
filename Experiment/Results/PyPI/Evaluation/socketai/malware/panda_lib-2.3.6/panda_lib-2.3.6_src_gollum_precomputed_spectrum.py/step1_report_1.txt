{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling precomputed spectral data, including various processing methods such as normalization, resampling, broadening, and fitting. It appears intended for scientific spectral analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`gollum.utilities`, `scipy`, `specutils`, `astropy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `logging`), and class methods accessing attributes like `self.wavelength`, `self.flux`, and `self.meta` for data manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate or modify spectral data, including `normalize()`, `resample()`, `apply_boolean_mask()`, `divide_by_blackbody()`, and plotting functions, primarily operating on self's spectral data attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input spectral attributes (`wavelength`, `flux`) through processing methods like normalization, broadening, shifting, and fitting, ultimately producing modified spectra or visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. The code primarily consists of scientific data processing routines. No hidden or obfuscated code features are detected. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive spectrum data container with methods for normalization, broadening, shifting, resampling, and fitting. It uses well-established scientific libraries (astropy, specutils, scipy). No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors, are present. The warnings suppressed relate to known issues in external libraries and do not indicate malicious intent. The data handling appears to be purely scientific and local. No hardcoded secrets, external command execution, or other malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate scientific library for spectral analysis. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code focuses on spectral data manipulation and visualization, employing standard scientific libraries and practices.",
