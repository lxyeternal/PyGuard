{
  "purpose": "This code provides a container class for handling precomputed spectra, including methods for normalization, broadening, shifting, resampling, fitting continuum, and plotting spectra, primarily for astrophysical applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from object properties such as self.wavelength and self.flux, as well as from input arguments like target_spectrum, spectrum objects, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be exposed if properties like self.meta contain secrets; however, no explicit data exfiltration or network activity is present. No insecure data sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input spectra (self and target_spectrum), through transformations (resampling, normalization, shifting, broadening), and into output spectra or plots. No external untrusted data sources or outputs to network are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The warnings are suppressed for known astropy issues, which is standard practice. The code appears clean and typical for spectral data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class extending Spectrum1D for spectral analysis, with methods for physical and instrumental manipulations. It includes proper use of scientific libraries, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling. The suppression of warnings for known library issues is standard for maintaining compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code or backdoors, nor any attempt to exfiltrate data or perform unauthorized actions. The functions operate on scientific data in a controlled manner. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended for spectral data analysis, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spectral data handling class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected scientific operations, and no suspicious activity or malware is detected.",
