{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing Spectrum1D objects, including masking and wavelength range truncation.",
  "sources": "Input Spectrum1D objects and external parameters like masks or wavelength ranges.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions; no data output, network transmission, or external storage observed.",
  "flows": "Input Spectrum1D objects are masked or truncated based on provided parameters; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Use of assertions could be exploited if assertions are disabled, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manipulates Spectrum1D objects using standard library functions and asserts. No external network or data exfiltration, no code injection, and no suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The functions perform masking and wavelength truncation with typical numpy and specutils operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, focusing on spectrum data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate spectrum processing utility code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
