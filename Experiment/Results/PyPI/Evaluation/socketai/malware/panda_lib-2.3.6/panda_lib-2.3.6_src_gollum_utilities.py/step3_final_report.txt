{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for applying masks and truncating spectral data in Spectrum1D objects.",
  "sources": "Reads input Spectrum1D objects, spectral_axis values, mask arrays, and wavelength data from Spectrum1D objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration, network, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Reads spectral data from Spectrum1D objects; applies boolean masks; filters spectral ranges based on wavelength limits.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard use of assertions; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral data manipulation with proper validation, deep copying, and unit handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. Assertions are used for validation, which can be disabled but are common practice. No external communications or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for spectral data processing. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
