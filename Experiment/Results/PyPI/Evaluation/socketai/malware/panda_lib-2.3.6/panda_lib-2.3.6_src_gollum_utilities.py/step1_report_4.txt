{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to manipulate Spectrum1D objects, such as applying masks and truncating wavelength ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads spectrum data from Spectrum1D objects (spec.wavelength, spec.flux, spec.meta) and mask inputs; reads from grid objects for truncation.",
  "sinks": "Returns new Spectrum1D objects with modified spectral data; no direct data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (Spectrum1D objects, masks, wavelength ranges) are processed locally; output spectra are generated without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The functions perform standard spectrum manipulation. No obfuscated code or unusual logic found.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform input validation, shape checks, and data manipulation for spectrum objects. They use assertions to enforce input types and conditions. The code relies solely on standard scientific library functions and deep copies for metadata. No data is transmitted externally, and no system commands or network operations are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for spectral data processing with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of spectral data processing functions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
