{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to manipulate and truncate spectral data using the specutils Spectrum1D object, mainly for spectral analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'spec', 'mask', 'grid', and 'data', which are Spectrum1D objects or related data structures.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs modified Spectrum1D objects; it does not contain explicit network, file, or system command operations. No apparent data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (spec, mask, grid, data) flows into functions, undergo processing (mask application, wavelength truncation), and produce new Spectrum1D objects as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code employs standard library functions and typical spectral data handling. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spectrum masking and wavelength range truncation, both common in spectral data analysis. It asserts input types and shapes, and creates new Spectrum1D objects based on masks or wavelength limits. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system commands, or harmful operations. The code is clean, well-structured, and uses standard libraries with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for spectral data manipulation with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
