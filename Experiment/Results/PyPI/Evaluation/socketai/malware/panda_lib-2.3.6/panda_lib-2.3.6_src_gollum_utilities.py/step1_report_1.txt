{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing Spectrum1D objects, including applying masks and truncating spectra based on wavelength ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Spectrum1D objects (spec.wavelength, spec.flux, spec.meta, spec.mask), and input parameters such as mask and wavelength_range.",
  "sinks": "Returns modified Spectrum1D objects; no data is sent externally or over the network, and no sensitive data is written to files or output streams.",
  "flows": "Inputs (spec, mask, data, wavelength_range) flow into processing functions, and processed Spectrum1D objects are returned. No external data flows or command executions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Assertions and deep copies are standard safety measures.",
  "analysis": "The code uses straightforward data processing functions, with appropriate input validation. It performs spectrum masking and truncation based on wavelength ranges. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The assertions and input checks align with safe practices. The code does not include network operations, system modifications, or external command calls. Overall, the logic appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe utility for spectrum data manipulation with no malicious intent detected. It primarily operates on spectrum objects, applying masks and truncating data within specified wavelength ranges, with proper input validation and data handling.",
