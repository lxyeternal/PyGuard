  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, operates on Spectrum1D objects, and performs masking and wavelength truncation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation, is detected.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (numpy, specutils) and uses assertions and deep copies appropriately.\n- The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or mistakes that would impact security or functionality.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that could be exploited; the code is robust with input validation.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The assertions could theoretically be disabled if Python is run with optimizations, but this is standard practice and unlikely to be exploited.\n- The code does not perform any external operations, so the security risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1** (a minimal, acceptable risk due to assertions that could be disabled, but not malicious)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The code performs data manipulation on Spectrum1D objects with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- No external communications, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.  \n- The code uses standard practices, assertions, and deep copies for safety.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, legitimate, and appropriate for spectral data processing. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
