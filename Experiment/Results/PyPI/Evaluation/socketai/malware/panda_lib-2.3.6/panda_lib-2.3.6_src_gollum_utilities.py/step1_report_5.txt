{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to manipulate Spectrum1D objects, including applying masks and truncating wavelength ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Spectrum1D objects such as spec.wavelength, spec.flux, and spec.meta.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning modified Spectrum1D objects with masked or truncated data, and copying metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Spectrum1D objects through masking or truncation functions, resulting in new Spectrum1D objects with modified spectral axes, flux, and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of deep copy for meta is standard practice. No network activity or system modification code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries and specutils to process spectral data. The functions perform input validation, shape checks, and data masking/truncation with appropriate handling of units and metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden code. The code appears to be safe and designed for spectral data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, legitimate utility for spectral data manipulation. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates on Spectrum1D objects in a standard manner, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
