      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and conditional trigger point to a supply chain security threat. The scores in the reports are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
