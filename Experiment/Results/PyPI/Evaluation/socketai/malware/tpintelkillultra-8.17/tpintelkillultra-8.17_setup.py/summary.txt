  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, with indicators consistent with malicious activity. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL justify high malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further payload decoding confirms its intent."
