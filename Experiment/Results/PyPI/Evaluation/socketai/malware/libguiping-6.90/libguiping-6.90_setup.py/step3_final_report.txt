{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory, and if absent, executes a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command that contacts an external URL, likely for malicious purposes. It also defines package metadata for 'libguiping'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for 'tahg' directory; it imports subprocess and os modules; it uses subprocess.Popen to execute encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or downloading malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory (source), then executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess (sink), which contacts an external URL ('esquelesquad.rip') (external contact), potentially downloading or executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors; execution of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell commands; contact with suspicious external URLs; silent, hidden execution with no window; comments referencing malicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command contacting external malicious URLs, based on the absence of 'tahg' directory. The command is base64-encoded, hiding its true intent. The silent execution and error suppression further conceal malicious activity. The setup metadata appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious payload delivery. The code's behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as stealthy remote code execution and external command-and-control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily through obfuscated PowerShell execution contacting external malicious domains, with stealthy execution and error suppression. It should be treated as malicious, and the package should not be used or distributed until further analysis confirms payload safety.",
