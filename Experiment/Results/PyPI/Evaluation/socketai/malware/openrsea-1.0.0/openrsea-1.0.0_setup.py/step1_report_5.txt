{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and decrypts and executes embedded encrypted code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can run arbitrary commands or malicious payloads if the decryption output is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed at install time, use of obscure class names and variable names, encrypted data embedded directly in the code, execution during setup process, and no clear legitimate purpose for the dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package. It contains a custom install command that, on Windows systems, imports the requests and Fernet modules, decrypts an encrypted string using a hardcoded key, and executes the resulting code via exec(). The encrypted data appears to be an encrypted payload designed to run arbitrary code at install time. The use of encrypted code and runtime execution suggests malicious intent or sabotage. There is no visible legitimate reason for decrypting and executing code during package installation, especially with such obfuscation. These are strong indicators of malicious behavior aimed at executing arbitrary code, possibly for backdoor or malware purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. The obfuscated encrypted payload and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
