{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts and executes an encrypted payload during installation on Windows systems, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload and decryption key embedded in the code; the `exec()` function executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "The `exec()` function executing decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoors.",
  "flows": "The code reads the encrypted payload and key, decrypts them using Fernet, then executes the resulting code via `exec()` during installation on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; hardcoded encrypted payload and key; use of `exec()` on decrypted data; conditional execution only on Windows; import of modules (`requests`, `fernet`) but minimal apparent use.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, on Windows, imports modules, decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via `exec()`. The obfuscation and encrypted payload suggest concealment of malicious behavior. The use of `exec()` on decrypted data is a significant security risk, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The presence of hardcoded secrets and conditional execution on Windows further indicates malicious intent. The high scores assigned in reports (around 0.9 for malware and risk) are justified by these behaviors. The code's pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or backdoors, making it highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation, with obfuscation and concealed secrets. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. This package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
