{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package called 'openrsea' with custom installation behavior that executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), loads encrypted data, and decrypts it during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() which runs arbitrary code during installation; also imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules.",
  "flows": "Environment info -> Conditional check -> Import modules -> Decrypt data -> Execute code; also, setup process involving package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted code, hardcoded encryption key, deobfuscated variable names, encrypted payload that executes arbitrary code, dynamic code execution during installation, obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script installs a Python package with custom behavior. It decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload likely contains malicious code that runs during package installation, which could perform unauthorized actions. The use of hardcoded encryption keys and dynamic execution raises significant security concerns. The code also imports potentially unnecessary modules ('requests') and includes obfuscated variable names, indicating intent to conceal malicious activity. No benign or harmless behaviors are apparent; all actions suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, indicating a supply chain security risk. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, and dynamic code execution strongly suggests malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
