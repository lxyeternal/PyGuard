{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'openrsea' with a custom installation step that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for version, description, long description, and an encrypted Fernet key; it also imports modules 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'. The encrypted data is decrypted and executed during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code, potentially malicious, during installation.",
  "flows": "The encrypted string is decrypted with Fernet, then executed via exec(), potentially running malicious code in the install environment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encrypted payload executed at install time, the use of obfuscated variable names, and the inclusion of a potentially malicious execution step during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install class that, upon installation on Windows ('nt'), decrypts an embedded encrypted payload and executes it dynamically. The use of Fernet encryption suggests the payload is concealed intentionally. Running exec() on decrypted code during setup is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The code does not perform any benign or necessary setup tasks with this payload, indicating malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains a malicious backdoor that executes decrypted code during installation, likely for malicious purposes. The code's obfuscation and encrypted payload significantly increase the risk of malicious behavior. Overall, this package should be considered highly dangerous and not suitable for use.",
