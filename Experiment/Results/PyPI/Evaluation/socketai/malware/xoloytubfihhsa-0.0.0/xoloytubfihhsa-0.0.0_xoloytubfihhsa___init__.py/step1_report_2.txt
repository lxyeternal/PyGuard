  "purpose": "The script logs Roblox cookies from the user's browser, validates the cookie, retrieves user info, and sends this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies via browser_cookie3 for domains related to Roblox; user IP address via api.ipify.org; Roblox API endpoints for user info and verification.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data (cookies, user info, IP address) to a Discord webhook using requests.post.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie collection → Cookie validation → User info retrieval → Data compilation → Webhook POST with all user data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie extraction methods for Roblox cookies, and sending sensitive data (Roblox cookie, IP address) to an external webhook. No obfuscated code, but the code is focused on stealing user credentials and private info.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and setting up a Discord webhook. It defines functions to clear the console and to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers. It then collects cookies, IP address, and verifies the cookie's validity. If valid, it retrieves user information such as UserID, RAP, friends count, account age, creation date, username, Robux balance, and premium status via Roblox APIs and the robloxpy library. Finally, it sends all this information, including the Roblox security cookie and IP address, to a Discord webhook. The code’s purpose is to steal Roblox account credentials and associated private data, indicating malicious intent. It does not employ obfuscation techniques but is clearly designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a cookie logger and information stealer targeting Roblox accounts. It collects user cookies, verifies them, retrieves personal data, and exfiltrates all data to an external server via Discord webhook. It poses a significant security threat due to the theft of private user data and credentials.",
