{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies and user information from the user's browser, verify the cookie validity, and send the collected data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser cookie storage for domains related to Roblox (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) and retrieves external IP address via an API.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected cookies and user information to a Discord webhook, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Cookie data is retrieved from browser storage -> Cookie validity is checked -> If valid, user info is fetched from Roblox API -> Data is posted to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Code is explicitly designed to extract and exfiltrate Roblox cookies and user info without user consent. Uses multiple browser cookie sources for redundancy. No obfuscation or misleading variable names but highly suspicious intent. The script runs system commands but does not specify their use, potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The script collects cookies from various browsers for the Roblox domain, targeting sensitive authentication cookies. It validates these cookies, and upon validation, retrieves user data including username, user ID, Robux balance, account age, friends count, and profile links. It then exfiltrates all this information, including the cookies, to a Discord webhook. The purpose appears to be malicious data theft or account hijacking. There are no signs of obfuscation or benign functionality; all activities aim to harvest and transmit user credentials and private information without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is clearly malicious, designed to steal Roblox cookies and user data, then exfiltrate it via Discord webhook. It operates covertly, collecting sensitive data from the user's browser and validating it before sending. The overall security risk is high due to the explicit malicious intent and sensitive data exfiltration.",
