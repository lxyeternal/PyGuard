{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Roblox account info logger that extracts cookies from the user's browser, validates the Roblox cookie, and if valid, retrieves user information and sends it to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), external API requests (ipify, roblox API, robloxpy), user input (cookies), and environment (network).",
  "sinks": "Sending data to a Discord webhook URL; printing information; making HTTP requests that include sensitive cookie data.",
  "flows": "Browser cookies are read and stored; cookies are validated with Roblox; user info is fetched via Roblox API; all data, including cookies and IP address, are sent to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects Roblox cookies and IP address without user consent; it sends potentially sensitive user information and cookies over a third-party webhook; it attempts to hide malicious intent by disguising as a 'grabber'. Hardcoded webhook URL and lack of user notification are suspicious. The code does not sanitize or obfuscate data transmission, and it directly accesses cookies from multiple browsers.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to steal Roblox cookies by extracting cookies from various browsers, validate the cookies' authenticity, and if valid, gather user data such as username, UserID, Robux balance, and account creation date. It then posts this sensitive data, along with the IP address and cookies, to a specified Discord webhook. The approach indicates malicious intent aimed at account hijacking or data theft. The use of multiple browser cookie sources, direct data transmission to an external webhook, and lack of user consent demonstrate malicious behavior. The code does not contain obfuscation but performs actions typically associated with malware targeting Roblox accounts. The script also includes a fake 'Loading...' message to distract users, which further supports malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox account cookies and personal information by extracting browser cookies, validating them, and exfiltrating data via a Discord webhook. It exhibits typical malicious behaviors such as unauthorized data collection and transmission. It should be considered malware with high security risk and warrants immediate caution and blocklisting.",
