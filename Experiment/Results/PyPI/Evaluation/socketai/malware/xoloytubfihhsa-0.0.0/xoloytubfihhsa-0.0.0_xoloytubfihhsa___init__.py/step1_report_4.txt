{
  "purpose": "The script collects Roblox account cookies and user information, then sends the data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 library reads cookies from various browsers; requests to IP and Roblox API endpoints for user info; user input is not directly taken, but cookies are accessed from browser storage.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected cookies and user info to a Discord webhook; potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser storage -> cookies are validated with Roblox API -> if valid, user info is fetched -> data (including cookies) is sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The script persistently searches multiple browsers for '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies, which can be used for account takeover; the code sends cookies and user info to a third-party webhook without user consent; no obfuscation, but the intent to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers, which are used for Roblox account authentication. It validates the cookie and, if valid, retrieves user details such as user ID, RAP, friends count, account age, and profile info. All sensitive data, including cookies and IP address, are then sent to an external Discord webhook. The process involves collecting potentially private information and exfiltrating it without user knowledge. The code does not contain obfuscation, but its intent is malicious in context as a credential harvesting tool. The code relies on well-known libraries and API endpoints, but the purpose aligns with malicious data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a credential stealer for Roblox accounts, harvesting cookies and user info and exfiltrating this data via a webhook. It exhibits behaviors typical of malicious activity aimed at account compromise and privacy invasion.",
