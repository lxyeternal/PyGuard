{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to harvest Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate them, retrieve user information, and exfiltrate all collected data—including cookies, user info, and IP address—to a Discord webhook for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for domain 'roblox.com'; external IP address via api.ipify.org; Roblox API endpoints for user info and validation.",
  "sinks": "Sending all collected data via POST request to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from multiple browsers -> cookies are validated with Roblox API -> user info is retrieved from Roblox API -> all data (cookies, user info, IP) is sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Explicitly malicious intent; no obfuscation; multiple browser sources; use of os.system() functions (though not actively used here); direct exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs unauthorized collection of Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validates the cookies, retrieves user profile information, and exfiltrates all data to an external Discord webhook. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or misleading variables, indicating malicious intent. It leverages browser_cookie3 for cookie access, requests for API calls, and directly posts data to a webhook, confirming data theft behavior. The absence of obfuscation and the explicit data exfiltration confirm high malicious potential. The code's purpose aligns with typical credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious credential logger and data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox accounts. It performs unauthorized cookie harvesting, validation, user info retrieval, and exfiltration, posing a high security threat. The malware score is 1, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 1, consistent with its malicious behavior.",
