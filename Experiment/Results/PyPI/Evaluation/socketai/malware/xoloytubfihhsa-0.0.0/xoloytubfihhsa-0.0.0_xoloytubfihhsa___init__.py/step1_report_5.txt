{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies and user information from the victim’s browser, validate the cookie, and then send detailed user information, including the cookie, to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies for domains related to Roblox (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome), HTTP GET request to ipify.org for IP address, and Roblox API endpoints for user info.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via POST request to a Discord webhook URL, potentially leaking sensitive Roblox cookie and IP address to an external server.",
  "flows": "Cookies are gathered from browser cookies (source), validated using Roblox API, user info fetched, then the collected sensitive data (cookie, IP, user info) is sent to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes the collection of cookies from multiple browsers, usage of a webhook to exfiltrate sensitive data, and no user consent or notification—indicative of malicious intent. The code also hardcodes the webhook URL, and the purpose appears to be stealing user credentials and personal info.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers cookies from various browsers for the Roblox domain, which is inherently suspicious as it aims to steal login tokens. It validates the cookie, then retrieves sensitive user info, including user ID, Robux balance, premium status, and profile details. All this information, along with the victim’s IP address, is exfiltrated via a webhook to an external server. The usage of 'os.system' for command execution, although not exploited here, indicates potential for malicious commands. The overall structure indicates an intent to hijack user accounts and leak private data, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it harvests user cookies and personal info, then exfiltrates it to an external server via webhook. Its purpose aligns with credential theft, privacy invasion, and potential account hijacking. The code structure and behavior are typical of a malicious data-stealing script.",
