  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code's purpose is explicitly malicious: it collects Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validates them, retrieves user info, and exfiltrates all data via a Discord webhook.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, and the intent is clearly malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently set to 1 across reports, which aligns with the malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is also high (1), which is justified given the data theft and exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code reads cookies from browsers, IP via API, and Roblox API for info.\n- **Sinks:** Correct; data sent to Discord webhook.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Correct; no obfuscation, highly suspicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; malicious code designed for data theft.\n- **Scores:** Malware=1, SecurityRisk=1, Confidence=0.9. These seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correct; multiple browsers, no user consent, malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the code is a credential stealer.\n- **Scores:** Malware=1, SecurityRisk=1, Confidence=0.9. These are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report correctly assesses the malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correct; the code is clearly malicious, exfiltrating sensitive data.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=1, SecurityRisk=1, Confidence=0.95. Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correct; the code collects cookies, no user consent, exfiltrates data.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=1, SecurityRisk=1, Confidence=0.9. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correct; the code is designed for malicious data theft.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=1, SecurityRisk=1, Confidence=0.9. Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Critical Points:**\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code explicitly exfiltrates cookies and user info to a webhook, confirming malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Potential False Positives:** The reports correctly identify malicious behavior; no false assumptions.\n- **Scores Higher Than 0.5:** All are appropriate given the malicious intent and data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **1** for all reports, as the code is clearly malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **1**, reflecting high security risk due to data theft and account hijacking potential.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their reasoning and scoring. They correctly identify the code as malicious, with high security risk, and no obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **1**   | **0**        | **1** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's behavior.",
