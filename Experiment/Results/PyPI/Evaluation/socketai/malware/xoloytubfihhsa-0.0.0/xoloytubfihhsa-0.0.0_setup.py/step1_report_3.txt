  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'xoloytubfihhsa' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input data; it mainly defines package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields, but this alone isn't suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No input reading, no data processing, no network connections, and no code execution mechanisms present. The dependencies include popular libraries: browser_cookie3, discordwebhook, robloxpy, requests. These libraries are standard and their inclusion is typical for functionality related to web requests, cookies, and Discord webhooks, not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward and follows common setup conventions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are detected based on this snippet.",
