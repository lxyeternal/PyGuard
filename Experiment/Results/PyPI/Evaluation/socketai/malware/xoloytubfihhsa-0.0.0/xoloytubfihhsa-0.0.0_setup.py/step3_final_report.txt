  "sources": "Package name, dependencies list, author fields (though empty).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static setup configuration, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical package name 'xoloytubfihhsa'; empty author fields.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no malicious code, data leaks, or network activity. The only suspicious aspect is the package name, which appears obfuscated, potentially to hide intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are common libraries, not inherently malicious. The malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity. The obfuscated score can be moderate (~0.4), reflecting suspicion due to the package name. The security risk score remains low (~0.1-0.2). The reports correctly identify the benign nature but note the obfuscation, which warrants cautious review if part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the obfuscated package name, which is not sufficient to assign a high malware or risk score. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and low security risk (~0.15). Monitoring downstream usage is recommended if additional code is provided.",
