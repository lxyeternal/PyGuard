  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with no malicious behavior detected. The only concern is the obfuscated package name, which is not sufficient to assign a high malware or risk score. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and low security risk (~0.15). Monitoring downstream usage is recommended if additional code is provided."
