  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'ForgyPs', used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the script itself, including author info, dependencies, and other metadata.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; standard setup process without user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A - typical setup configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Author email and description fields contain email addresses; no secrets or credentials embedded. License and URL fields are empty, which may indicate incomplete info but not malicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Dependencies specified are standard packages, no suspicious versions or sources.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, specifying metadata and dependencies. No code execution, data input, or external network activity occurs here. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code snippets are present. The dependencies are common and from legitimate sources. Overall, this appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious code or data leaks.",
