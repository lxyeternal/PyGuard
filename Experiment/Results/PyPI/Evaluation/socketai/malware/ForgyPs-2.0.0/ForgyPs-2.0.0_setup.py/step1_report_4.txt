  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ForgyPs Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and author information; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or cause side effects; primarily metadata definition.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or systems.",
  "anomalies": "License and URL fields are empty; description appears to contain an email address instead of descriptive text, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration defining package name, version, packages, dependencies, and author info. Dependencies are specified with exact versions, which is typical. No malicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated constructs are present. No code injections or insecure patterns are detected. The only atypical aspect is the 'description' field containing an email address, which may be a misconfiguration but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate and intended for packaging purposes.",
