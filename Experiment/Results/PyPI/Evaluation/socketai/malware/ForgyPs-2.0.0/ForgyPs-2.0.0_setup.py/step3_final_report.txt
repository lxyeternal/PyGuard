  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings within the setup() call, including package name, version, author, author_email, description, url, license, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of email addresses in 'description' and 'author_email' fields; 'url' and 'license' fields are empty, indicating incomplete metadata. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static, hardcoded package metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or external data handling occurs. The email addresses are likely placeholders or misconfigurations. Dependencies are standard and from reputable sources. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The anomalies are superficial and related to incomplete metadata, not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The anomalies are minor and do not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1 due to incomplete metadata.",
