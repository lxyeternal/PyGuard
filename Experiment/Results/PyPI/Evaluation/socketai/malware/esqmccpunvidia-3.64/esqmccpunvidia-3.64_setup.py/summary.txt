  "conclusion": "The code executes an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command referencing a suspicious domain during setup, indicating high malicious potential. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery or backdoors. The package should be considered malicious or compromised, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation. The high malware and risk scores are justified by the obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL."
