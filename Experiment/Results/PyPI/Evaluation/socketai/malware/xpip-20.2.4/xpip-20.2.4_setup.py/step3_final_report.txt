  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'xpip' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata during execution; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, no obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, typical setup script that calls setup() with fixed parameters and uses find_packages() for package discovery. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimate given the static, safe code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments are accurate; the malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0.",
