  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'xpip' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the script itself during execution of the setup function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points are present; the code only performs package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows or input handling beyond standard setup invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of find_packages() is typical for package discovery.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup with fixed package name and version, and auto-discovery of packages. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
