  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating high malicious potential. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain tactics, warranting a high malware score (~0.85), high obfuscation (~0.85), and high security risk (~0.8). Further analysis of the decoded payload is recommended, but based on current evidence, the package should be considered dangerous."
