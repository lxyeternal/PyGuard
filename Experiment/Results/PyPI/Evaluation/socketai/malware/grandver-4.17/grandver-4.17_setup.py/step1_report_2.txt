{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'grandver' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment state (checks for 'tahg' directory), and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command, which could be used to run arbitrary code or perform malicious actions if manipulated.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, and the use of subprocess with creationflags to hide window suggests an attempt to conceal activity. The script suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils' to set up a package. Before setup, it attempts to check for a directory 'tahg'. If missing, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is suspicious. The PowerShell command's purpose cannot be determined without decoding, but such obfuscation and silent execution of external code are common in malicious scripts. The setup call itself appears legitimate but is preceded by potentially malicious activity. Error handling is silent, which may conceal failures or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution that is triggered based on the presence of a directory, which is suspicious. The setup process appears legitimate, but the pre-install behavior indicates possible malicious intent or backdoor setup. The overall risk is moderate to high due to obfuscation and concealed execution.",
