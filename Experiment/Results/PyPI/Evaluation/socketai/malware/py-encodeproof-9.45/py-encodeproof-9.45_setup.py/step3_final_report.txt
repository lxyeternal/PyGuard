  "purpose": "Detects and executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "PowerShell command execution via subprocess; potential remote code download or execution.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, runs obfuscated PowerShell command silently.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded command; silent execution with suppressed errors; suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently when 'tahg' is missing. The command is base64-encoded, run with no window, and errors are suppressed, indicating an attempt to conceal activity. The presence of a suspicious URL comment further raises concern. The obfuscation and silent execution are typical of malicious payloads, though the actual payload is not decoded, so malicious intent cannot be confirmed definitively. The broad try-except blocks and hidden command suggest malicious or sabotage intent, aligning with high suspicion. The scores assigned (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed covertly during setup, indicative of malicious activity. While the exact payload remains unverified without decoding, the obfuscation, silent execution, and red flags warrant treating this package as potentially malicious. The high scores reflect the significant security concern.",
