      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed covertly during setup, indicative of malicious activity. While the exact payload remains unverified without decoding, the obfuscation, silent execution, and red flags warrant treating this package as potentially malicious. The high scores reflect the significant security concern."
