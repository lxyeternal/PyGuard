  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox account cookies and user information from the browser, verify their validity, and then send detailed user data including cookies, IP address, and account details to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads browser cookies from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chromium) related to 'roblox.com'. It also makes HTTP requests to external services to obtain IP address and user info, and reads environment data like cookies from the browser.",
  "sinks": "The code sends extracted data to a Discord webhook, including sensitive Roblox cookies and user account information. It also makes HTTP GET requests to external APIs for IP and Roblox user info, which could be data leaks if misused.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from the browser (sources), validated via Roblox API, and then the information is sent to the webhook (sink). IP address is fetched and combined with user info, then transmitted through the webhook. The Roblox cookie is included directly in the message payload.",
  "anomalies": "The script hardcodes the webhook URL (potentially sensitive), extracts cookies directly from browsers without validation, and sends sensitive data (cookies, IP, account info) to an external server. It also uses os.system calls, which can be risky if manipulated. The purpose is clearly malicious, focusing on credential theft and account scraping.",
  "analysis": "The code loads browser cookies for Roblox, searches for a specific cookie (.ROBLOSECURITY), and retrieves it. It then validates this cookie with Roblox's API. If valid, it fetches user details and account info, including Roblox and external data (IP). All sensitive data, including cookies, user ID, and IP address, are sent to an external Discord webhook. The code does not sanitize inputs or obfuscate data, directly exposing sensitive information to a third-party service. The script’s intent is clearly malicious, aiming to harvest Roblox account data and send it externally without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal Roblox account cookies and personal data, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook. It operates by collecting browser cookies, validating them, and then sending sensitive account details externally. The overall purpose is malicious credential harvesting and information theft.",
