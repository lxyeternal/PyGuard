{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates the cookie, retrieves user information and IP address, and exfiltrates this data via a webhook, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials and personal data.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies from Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, and Chrome; external IP address via api.ipify.org; Roblox API endpoints for user info.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook POST request; potentially system commands via os.system (though unused here).",
  "flows": "Cookie extraction from browsers → cookie validation → user info and IP retrieval → data exfiltration via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; direct exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent; presence of unused functions ('command', 'cls') suggesting possible obfuscation or extension; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple steps to harvest Roblox cookies from various browsers, validates the cookie, retrieves user details and IP address, and then exfiltrates all this information to an external webhook. The code lacks error handling, uses a hardcoded webhook, and directly sends sensitive data, indicating malicious intent. The functions for executing system commands are defined but unused, which could be for obfuscation or future malicious features. The overall behavior aligns with credential-stealing malware. No obfuscation techniques are evident, and the code is straightforward, though some functions hint at potential future obfuscation. The exfiltration of cookies and user data without user consent confirms malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Roblox users, exfiltrating cookies, user info, and IP addresses via a webhook. It operates covertly, with no user consent, and presents a serious security threat.",
