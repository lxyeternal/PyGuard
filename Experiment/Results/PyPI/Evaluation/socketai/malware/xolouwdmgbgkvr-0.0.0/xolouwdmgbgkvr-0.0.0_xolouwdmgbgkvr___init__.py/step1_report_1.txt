  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox account cookies from various browsers, validate the cookies, retrieve user information from Roblox, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 functions reading cookies from Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome for the domain 'roblox.com'; external requests to 'https://api.ipify.org/' and Roblox APIs for user data.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request to send gathered user info including cookies and IP address; system calls (os.system) for command execution, potentially malicious if misused.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie extraction → cookie validation via robloxpy → data retrieval from Roblox API → data sent via webhook; cookie value used directly in requests and webhook payload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, use of os.system commands without sanitization, extraction of cookies without user consent, including cookies directly in webhook messages, no error handling for failed requests or data, potentially enabling malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script loads cookies from multiple browsers targeting 'roblox.com', focusing on the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, which is sensitive. It performs validation of this cookie via robloxpy, and upon success, retrieves user info including user ID, Robux balance, account age, and IP address, then exfiltrates all this information to a Discord webhook. The code also contains a system call function that could be used to execute commands, which might be malicious if misused, though not explicitly used in the provided snippet. Hardcoded webhook URL and direct inclusion of sensitive cookie data in messages strongly suggest malicious intent, as the script appears designed to steal user data covertly. The code lacks error handling for network failures or invalid responses, further indicating malicious design to silently exfiltrate data. Overall, the code is highly suspicious, with clear intent to compromise user accounts and leak sensitive data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, designed to extract Roblox cookies and personal data, validate and use this information to gather user details, and exfiltrate everything via a webhook. Its structure and behavior strongly indicate a spyware or credential-stealing purpose.",
