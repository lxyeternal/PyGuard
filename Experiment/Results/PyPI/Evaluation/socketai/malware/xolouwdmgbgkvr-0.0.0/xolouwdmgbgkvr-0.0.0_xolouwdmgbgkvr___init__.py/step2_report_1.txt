  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Clearly states the code is designed to extract Roblox cookies, validate, retrieve user info, and send data to a webhook.\n- **Sources:** Browser cookies from multiple browsers, external IP and Roblox APIs.\n- **Sinks:** Webhook POST, system commands (potentially malicious).\n- **Flow:** Cookie extraction → validation → data retrieval → exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded webhook, no error handling, cookies exfiltrated directly, use of os.system.\n- **Analysis:** The code's behavior indicates malicious intent—covertly stealing cookies and user data, exfiltrating without user consent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious, credential-stealing, high risk, malware score 1, security risk 1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing cookie theft, validation, data exfiltration.\n- Notes the same issues: hardcoded webhook, multiple browser cookie access, no sanitization, exfiltration of sensitive data.\n- Malware score 1, security risk 1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on cookie extraction, validation, user info gathering, and exfiltration.\n- Mentions the presence of unused functions ('command', 'cls') possibly for obfuscation.\n- Clearly malicious intent, high confidence, malware 1, security risk 1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: cookie extraction, validation, info gathering, exfiltration.\n- Slightly lower malware score (0.8), but still high.\n- Noted that the code is not obfuscated but performs malicious data collection.\n- Malware 0.8, security risk 0.85, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also describes cookie theft, validation, info gathering, exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation, straightforward malicious behavior.\n- Malware 0.9, security risk 0.85, confidence 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** All reports agree the code exfiltrates Roblox cookies and user info to an external webhook.\n- **Functionality in code:** The core functions—cookie extraction, validation, data gathering, exfiltration—are present and active.\n- **Error handling:** Missing or minimal, which is typical for malicious scripts aiming for silent operation.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present explicitly, but some functions (like 'command') suggest possible future obfuscation or extension.\n- **Malware and risk scores:** Consistently high, justified by malicious intent and data exfiltration.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain at or near 1, given the clear credential-stealing behavior.\n- The security risk is high due to data exfiltration of sensitive user information.\n- The obfuscation score can be low unless further obfuscated code is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **1** (confirmed malicious intent)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **1** (high security threat due to credential theft and data exfiltration)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Roblox users, exfiltrating cookies, user info, and IP addresses via a webhook. It operates covertly, with no user consent, and presents a serious security threat.\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per individual report or further analysis.",
