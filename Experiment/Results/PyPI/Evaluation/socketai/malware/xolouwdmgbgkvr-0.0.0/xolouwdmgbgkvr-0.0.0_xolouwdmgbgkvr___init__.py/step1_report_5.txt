  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate the cookie, gather user information via Roblox APIs, and send the collected data to a specified Discord webhook. It functions as a cookie logger and information collector.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser cookies (via browser_cookie3 library), makes HTTP requests to external APIs (ipify, Roblox API), and reads environment data (cookies).",
  "sinks": "The code sends sensitive data (cookie, user info, IP address) directly to a Discord webhook using requests.post, which could leak data if webhook URL is compromised.",
  "flows": "Cookie data is gathered from browser cookies -> validated via Roblox API -> user info fetched from Roblox API -> data sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system calls for command execution but does not execute any commands; however, it collects cookies and sends them externally, which is suspicious. The presence of functions named 'cookieLogger' and 'command' with no apparent use of command execution is benign but noteworthy. The variable 'webhookk' is hardcoded with a suspiciously named message; the code operates silently and exfiltrates data without user consent. No obfuscation present. No obfuscated code detected. The code includes multiple try-except blocks for cookie extraction, which can obscure failures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs malicious actions by silently collecting Roblox cookies from various browsers, validating their authenticity, and then exfiltrating sensitive user information (including the cookie, IP address, and account details) to an external Discord webhook. The code does not implement any safeguards or user prompts, indicating an intent to secretly harvest and leak user data. The usage of external API calls for IP and Roblox user info, combined with direct transmission to an external webhook, signifies malicious exfiltration. No obfuscation or evasion techniques are used. The code’s structure is straightforward but designed for malicious data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it performs secret collection of user cookies and sensitive information, then exfiltrates the data to an external webhook without user consent. It functions as a cookie stealer and information logger, representing a clear security threat.",
