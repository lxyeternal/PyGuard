  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate the cookies, gather user information from Roblox, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook. It appears to be used for capturing user credentials and personal information for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie storage accessed via browser_cookie3 for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chromium. External API calls to get IP address and Roblox user info.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request sending sensitive information (Roblox cookies, user info, IP address) to an external server. System commands via os.system (though not actively used for malicious activity here).",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser cookies -> validated via Roblox API -> user info fetched -> data compiled -> sent via webhook to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code extracts Roblox cookies directly from user browsers, including multiple browser types. It logs and transmits cookies and account details without user consent. The 'dummy_message' is used to distract or obfuscate. The code uses os.system for executing commands but does not do so maliciously here, though it might be a vector for further malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by defining a function to log cookies from multiple browsers, specifically targeting Roblox cookies. It then retrieves the Roblox cookies and validates them via the Roblox API. If valid, it proceeds to gather extensive user info, including user ID, RAP, friends count, age, account creation date, and profile links. It also fetches the user's IP address. All collected data, including the Roblox cookie, is sent to an external Discord webhook, indicating a clear exfiltration of sensitive user data. The code does not include obfuscation, but it performs potentially malicious data collection and exfiltration activities. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of sensitive data without user consent are significant red flags.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a cookie stealer and user data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox users. It collects browser cookies, validates them, gathers personal account details, and sends the information to an external webhook, which could be used maliciously. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads beyond data theft. Overall, it exhibits high malicious intent with significant security risks.",
