{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to steal Roblox cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY), gather user information, and exfiltrate it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for roblox.com; network requests to ipify.org, roblox API endpoints, and external webhooks.",
  "sinks": "Webhook POST request, reading cookies from browser, and accessing Roblox user info APIs.",
  "flows": "Cookies are collected from browser cookies, validated via Roblox API, then user data is fetched and sent to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie extraction methods, collecting sensitive cookies, and exfiltrating user info without consent. The variable 'webhookk' contains a suspicious message format. The code includes functions for executing shell commands ('command', 'cls') but they are unused here, indicating possible obfuscation or partial code.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by printing a distractor message 'Loading...'. It then attempts to extract Roblox cookies from various browsers, specifically looking for the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie. If found, it stores all cookies and the specific security cookie. It then retrieves the public IP address. The Roblox cookie is validated for authenticity. If invalid, a notification is sent via webhook. If valid, user info is fetched from Roblox's API, including user ID, username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, creation date, friends count, and profile images. All this information, along with the cookie and IP address, is sent to a specified Discord webhook. The code actively exfiltrates sensitive user data, indicating malicious intent.\n\nAdditional observations include the presence of unused functions ('command', 'cls') that execute system commands, possibly for obfuscation or future extensions. The code is focused entirely on data theft related to Roblox accounts, with no legitimate functionality beyond this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest Roblox cookies and user info, then send them to an external webhook. It involves multiple cookie extraction methods and network requests to validate and gather sensitive data. Its intent is clearly to compromise user accounts without consent.",
