  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as environment variables, user inputs, command-line arguments, network requests, file reads, and imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system operations, environment variable access, system commands, dynamic code execution, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables, network) to sinks (network transmission, file writes, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; no malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets or descriptions lack concrete implementation details, making detailed static analysis impossible. The reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign nature of the code, assigning low malware and security risk scores. The confidence levels reflect the limited information, and no suspicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The cautious approach is justified given the lack of actual code, and the scores are consistent with the descriptions provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments are appropriate, and the supply chain risk appears minimal. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
