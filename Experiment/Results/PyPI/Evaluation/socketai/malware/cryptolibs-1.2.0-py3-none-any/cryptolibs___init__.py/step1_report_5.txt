{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious information stealer and data exfiltration tool that collects cookies, passwords, browser history, system information, and potentially Roblox and Minecraft credentials, then uploads the data to remote servers or services under the guise of monitoring or spying activities.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system information, browser data (local state files, cookies, passwords, history, credit card info), clipboard content, and processes running on the system; reads files in user directories and browser profiles; intercepts clipboard data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs (including Discord webhooks, transfer.sh, and other domains), uploading of collected data files (passwords, cookies, system info, screenshots), execution of system commands (killing processes, modifying files), and file creation in TEMP and application data directories.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, browser storage, clipboard, and process lists feed into collection functions; data is then encrypted/decrypted or directly read; then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests or uploaded files to remote servers; some data is also written to local files before upload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL pointing to suspicious domain, extensive use of system commands to kill processes, copying and zipping browser data without user consent, checking for virtual machine indicators, manipulating browser files (e.g., removing or modifying 'Local State' files, 'betterdiscord' files), obfuscated/complex code structures, and multiple attempts to intercept, decrypt, and upload sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a multi-stage malware with capabilities including browser data extraction (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), Discord token theft, system info gathering, process termination, clipboard monitoring with address replacement, and file uploads. It utilizes threading for concurrent data collection, encrypts/decrypts sensitive data, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file hosting services. It also employs VM and sandbox detection techniques, likely to avoid analysis. The code’s structure is complex, with several suspicious functions such as process killing, system modification, and data exfiltration, all targeting user credentials, cookies, and system info for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a data stealer and surveillance tool aimed at extracting user credentials, cookies, system details, and tokens, then exfiltrating the data to attacker-controlled servers. Its multiple methods for evasion, data collection, and exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent and it should be considered dangerous and unsafe for use.",
