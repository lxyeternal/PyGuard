{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python package 'tpsplitgui', with embedded malicious behavior involving remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call executing an encoded PowerShell command when 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell process that runs silently with encoded commands, potentially downloading or executing remote payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> conditional execution of encoded PowerShell command -> remote code execution or payload download.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded, base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently during setup; external suspicious domain; silent error suppression.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check and, if the 'tahg' directory is absent, executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command referencing an external domain. The command is obfuscated, indicating malicious intent, likely to download or execute remote payloads. The subprocess call uses flags to hide activity, and errors are suppressed silently. The setup() function appears normal but is exploited to run malicious code during installation. The obfuscation and external domain strongly suggest remote control or backdoor behavior. The code's behavior aligns with known supply chain attack tactics, with high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The external domain and stealthy execution confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
