  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code that appears to execute or decode multiple layers of encoded strings, possibly to hide malicious payloads or behaviors.",
  "sources": "Decoding functions that read base64-encoded data, encoded strings, and potentially encrypted payloads, especially within the decode and eval eval(eval()) constructs.",
  "sinks": "Eval function calls with decoded and decoded (double-decoded) data, which can execute arbitrary code or commands. Base64 decoding of strings that likely contain code or data, and the use of eval(eval()) to execute decoded strings.",
  "flows": "Data is read from base64-encoded strings, decoded twice, and then passed to eval() which executes it. The flow involves decoding strings and executing the resulting code dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple layers of base64 decoding, eval() calls with decoded data, and obfuscation techniques such as hex, octal, and base64 encoding. The presence of seemingly random encoded strings and the layering of decoding steps are typical of obfuscated malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with eval(eval(eval())), which indicates multiple levels of execution of dynamically decoded code. It extensively uses base64-encoded strings, which are decoded twice (decode(decode(b64decode(...)))) and then executed via eval(). The decoded data likely contains further code or commands, which could include malicious operations such as command execution, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The layered decoding and execution strongly suggest malicious intent, especially since the code is heavily obfuscated and uses eval(), a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The entire structure is designed to conceal the true payload and execute it at runtime, making it high risk and suspicious for supply chain sabotage or malware delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to its heavy obfuscation, multiple decoding layers, and use of eval() to execute dynamically decoded code. Its primary purpose appears to be to hide malicious payloads and execute arbitrary code on the host system, representing a significant security threat.",
