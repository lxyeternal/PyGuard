  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior observed. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, with no indication of malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code. It simply specifies dependencies and package metadata. No security risks identified.",
