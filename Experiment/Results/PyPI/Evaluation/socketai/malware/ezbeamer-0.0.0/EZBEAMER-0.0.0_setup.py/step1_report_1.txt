  "purpose": "To configure and set up the Python package 'EZBEAMER' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, assignment of VERSION, and setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or user input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns. Use of standard setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It imports necessary modules, defines a version, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The dependencies listed are common packages and do not indicate malicious intent. The lack of author information could be considered incomplete but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines the package metadata and dependencies.",
