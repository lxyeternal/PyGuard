  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It imports `setuptools`, defines a version, and calls `setup()` with package metadata and dependencies.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or network activity is present.\n- The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The dependencies listed are common Python packages: `browser_cookie3`, `discordwebhook`, `robloxpy`, and `requests`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a typical setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- Some reports note the empty author fields as unusual but not malicious.\n- A few reports mention the dependencies potentially being used maliciously, but the script itself does not execute or invoke them.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.** They are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.2, which is reasonable. The highest is 0.2, reflecting that dependencies could be misused elsewhere, but not in this script.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1 or 0.9, which is justified.\n\n**No adjustments needed here.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- All scores are 0 or very low, reflecting no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Since the code is purely a setup script with no runtime behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that dependencies like `discordwebhook` and `browser_cookie3` could be used maliciously. While true, the script itself does not do anything malicious; these are just dependencies.\n- No assumptions are made that go beyond the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in this setup script)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward package setup script, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The dependencies could be misused in the actual package, but that is outside the scope of this configuration file.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
