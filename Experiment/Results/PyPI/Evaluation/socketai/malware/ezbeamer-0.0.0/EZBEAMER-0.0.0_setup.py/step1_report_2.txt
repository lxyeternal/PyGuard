{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'EZBEAMER' with specified dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the script only contains setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata and dependencies without including any runtime code, data processing, or network interactions. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The dependencies listed are common for package setup and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares a package with specified dependencies for distribution.",
