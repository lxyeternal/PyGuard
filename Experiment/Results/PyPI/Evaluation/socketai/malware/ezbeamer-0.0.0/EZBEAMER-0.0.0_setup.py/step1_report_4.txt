{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'EZBEAMER'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' module for package setup, and reads the 'install_requires' list to specify dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not execute untrusted input or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration is static; dependencies listed are installed but not executed or invoked here.",
  "anomalies": "The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. 'discordwebhook' and 'browser_cookie3' could be used for web automation or data collection, but their mere presence does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata. There are no suspicious code behaviors, such as data collection, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The dependencies could potentially be used for malicious purposes in the package’s runtime, but this script alone does not perform any such actions. The overall structure is typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with no direct malicious behavior or security issues. The dependencies could potentially be misused in the actual package implementation, but that is outside the scope of this configuration file.",
