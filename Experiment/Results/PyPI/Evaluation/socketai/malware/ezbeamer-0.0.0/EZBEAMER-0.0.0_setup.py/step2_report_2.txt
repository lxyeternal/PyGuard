  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python setup script, importing `setuptools`, defining a version, and calling `setup()` with package metadata and dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The dependencies listed are common Python packages, some of which could be used for web automation or data collection (`browser_cookie3`, `discordwebhook`, `robloxpy`, `requests`).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malicious code:** None of the reports find any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Data flow or untrusted input:** No data flows from untrusted sources; no user input handling or network activity within this script.\n- **Dependencies:** While some dependencies could be used maliciously in runtime code, their mere presence in `install_requires` in a setup script does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Overly cautious language:** Several reports mention the potential misuse of dependencies like `discordwebhook` or `browser_cookie3`. While these libraries can be used maliciously, their inclusion alone in a setup script does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Author fields:** The empty author and email fields are noted as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Security risk scores:** Some reports assign a small but non-zero security risk (e.g., 0.2), citing potential misuse of dependencies. This is speculative; without runtime code, these are not actual risks in this script.\n\n### Scoring review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Most assign 0 or 0.2, with some considering potential misuse of dependencies. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0.1–0.2 seems slightly high but acceptable if considering potential runtime misuse.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- Since the script itself contains no malicious code, scores higher than 0.0 for malware or obfuscated code are unwarranted.\n- The small security risk score (0.2) is justified if considering that dependencies could be misused in the actual package implementation, but this is outside the scope of this script.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign.** The reports are consistent in their analysis, correctly identifying the script as a standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, considering dependencies could be misused in runtime, but not in this setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no security issues. The minor concerns about dependencies are speculative and do not warrant higher risk scores in this context.",
