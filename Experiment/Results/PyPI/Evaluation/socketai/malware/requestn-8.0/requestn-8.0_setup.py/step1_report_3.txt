  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package named 'requestn'.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; reads package metadata and finds packages to include.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup script; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Description field includes a Telegram handle '@rrrrrf' which is unusual in a package description but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or obfuscated code. The description includes a Telegram handle, which may be for contact purposes but does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package setup file with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The presence of a Telegram contact in the description is unusual but not malicious.",
