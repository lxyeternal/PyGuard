  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with metadata including package name, version, author, and description.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the setup() function parameters: name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The author description mentions a Telegram handle '@rrrrrf', which is unusual metadata but not malicious. No obfuscation or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious elements. The mention of a Telegram handle in the description is benign metadata, potentially used for contact or promotion. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. Malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk score is low (0.2) in some reports due to the Telegram handle, but this is a metadata concern rather than a security vulnerability. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated components. The mention of a Telegram handle is metadata and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
