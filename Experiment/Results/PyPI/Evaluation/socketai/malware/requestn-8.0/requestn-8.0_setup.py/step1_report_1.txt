  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'requestn' to facilitate distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package discovery via setuptools.find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious operations; typical setup process.",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata) used during setup, no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual description mentioning a Telegram handle '@rrrrrf' which could be used for malicious purposes such as advertising or phishing; minimal technical anomalies otherwise.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script for packaging a Python project. It includes typical metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package discovery. The author description references a Telegram handle, which might be used for malicious promotion or contact but is not inherently malicious in code. No code execution, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script follows conventional packaging practices with no obfuscated or malicious code components.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with a potentially suspicious author description but no malicious behavior or security risks identified within the code itself.",
