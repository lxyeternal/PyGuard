{
  "purpose": "Import the 'promain' function or object from the local module 'requestn'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'requestn' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink or untrusted data handling evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly shown; this code only imports a component.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'requestn' is unusual and potentially suspicious due to its similarity to 'request'. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement that imports 'promain' from a module named 'requestn'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or secret handling. The module name is slightly unconventional, but that alone is not suspicious. As this is only an import statement, it lacks operational logic or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual module name warrants a check of the actual 'requestn' module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious activity.",
