  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow analysis possible from this snippet alone",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed in this fragment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'promain' from a relative module 'requestn'. There is no data processing, input/output, or dynamic execution shown. With such a limited snippet, it cannot be determined if 'promain' performs malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are visible here. The code appears standard for module import.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is a standard import with no suspicious activity identified.",
