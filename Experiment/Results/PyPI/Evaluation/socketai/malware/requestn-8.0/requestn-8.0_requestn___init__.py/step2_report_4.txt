  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: a relative import of 'promain' from a local module 'requestn'.\n- None mention any dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is straightforward and matches the reports. No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n- **Potential flaws:** The reports correctly identify that, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Module name 'requestn':** Slightly unusual but not inherently suspicious; it could be a benign module or a typo of 'request'.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the minimal code.\n- The confidence scores vary but are generally high (0.8-0.9), which is reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n\n### Critical points:\n- Since the reports are all consistent and the code is minimal, there's no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The mention of the module name 'requestn' as potentially suspicious is noted, but without further context, it cannot be flagged as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 seems appropriate, given the unusual module name but no evidence of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign and straightforward.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed unless additional context or code is provided.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's simplicity.",
