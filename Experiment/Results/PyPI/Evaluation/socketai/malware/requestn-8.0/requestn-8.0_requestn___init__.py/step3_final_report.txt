{
  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of a minimal import statement from a local module 'requestn' in Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'requestn' noted but no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code, assign low malware and obfuscation scores, and assign a very low security risk score (~0.1). The module name 'requestn' is slightly unusual but not suspicious enough to alter the benign assessment. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
