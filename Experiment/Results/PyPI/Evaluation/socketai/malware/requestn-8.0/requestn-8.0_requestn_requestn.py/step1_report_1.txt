{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to enumerate files in the current directory and exfiltrate them by sending each as a document to a Telegram bot, while also sending a message to a specific chat.",
  "sources": "Reading files in the current directory via os.listdir() and os.path.isfile(), reading files when opening with open().",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram Bot API endpoints to send messages and documents, which can transmit exfiltrated data over the network.",
  "flows": "Directory files are collected, then each file is read and uploaded via requests.post() to Telegram, potentially exposing all files to the attacker's Telegram bot.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are sensitive credentials embedded in the code. The code also attempts to install modules dynamically, which is unusual. Sending all files unconditionally to a remote server indicates malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script enumerates all files in the current directory and uploads each file to a Telegram bot, which could be used for unauthorized data exfiltration. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID are prime indicators of malicious intent. The try-except block's fallback installs modules, which is unusual and may be suspicious. Additionally, the script sends a message '@is_brother' to a Telegram chat, further indicating command/control communication. Overall, the code is designed to covertly collect and send data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating local files to a remote Telegram bot using hardcoded credentials, indicating it functions as data theft malware. The presence of hardcoded secrets and automated file transmission confirms malicious intent.",
