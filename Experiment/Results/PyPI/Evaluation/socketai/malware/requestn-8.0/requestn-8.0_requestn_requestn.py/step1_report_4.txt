{
  "purpose": "The script enumerates files in the current directory and uploads each file to a specified Telegram chat via bot API, also sending a message for each file.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.path.isfile(), open(), requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() calls to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents",
  "flows": "os.listdir() -> file iteration -> requests.post() (sending messages and documents to Telegram)",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, unnecessary import attempts within try-except, use of system commands to install packages, lack of error handling for file access and network requests, uploading all files in directory without filtering, potential data exfiltration via Telegram.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import modules and install them if missing, which is unnecessary for 'webbrowser' and 'socket' as they are standard modules. It hardcodes a Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are used to send all files from the current directory to a Telegram chat, effectively exfiltrating data. The use of requests to send messages and files to Telegram indicates potential malicious behavior for data theft. The script writes filenames to 'SIN.txt' but does not perform any validation or filtering, increasing the risk of unintentionally sharing sensitive files. There is no indication of obfuscation or code hiding techniques. Overall, the script performs an unintended data exfiltration operation by uploading all files in the directory to a remote server.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating directory files via Telegram using hardcoded credentials. It is a data theft script with no legitimate purpose shown. It should be considered malicious with high security risk.",
