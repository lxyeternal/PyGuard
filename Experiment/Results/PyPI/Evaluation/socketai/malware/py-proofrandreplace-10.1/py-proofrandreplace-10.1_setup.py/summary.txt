  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during setup, with indicators pointing toward malicious activity. The high scores are justified, and the package should be flagged as potentially malicious pending further payload decoding."
