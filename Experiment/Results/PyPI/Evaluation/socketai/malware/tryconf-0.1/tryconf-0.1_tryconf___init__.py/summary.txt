  "conclusion": "No code present for analysis; all reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. The speculative report (Report 5) makes reasonable assumptions but remains unconfirmed. Overall, the dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with minimal risk scores due to lack of evidence."
