  "sources": "The code may read input from user inputs, environment variables, files, network responses, or data passed through functions. However, no explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include places where data is outputted, written to files, sent over the network, or executed as code. Without actual code, these cannot be precisely identified.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be established without specific code content. No source-to-sink paths are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behaviors, are observable due to the absence of code.",
  "analysis": "There is no code present to analyze, which limits the ability to identify security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscated segments. The review is inconclusive without code content.",
