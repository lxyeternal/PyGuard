  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, obfuscation signs.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate missing or empty code, preventing any source, sink, or flow analysis. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the lack of evidence. Report 5 makes assumptions based on typical patterns but explicitly states no actual code is available, making its higher confidence and cautious risk scores acceptable but speculative. Overall, the absence of code means no malicious or obfuscated activity can be confirmed. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and risk scores at or near 0, unless concrete code or behavior is provided.",
  "conclusion": "No code present for analysis; all reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. The speculative report (Report 5) makes reasonable assumptions but remains unconfirmed. Overall, the dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with minimal risk scores due to lack of evidence.",
