  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is missing or empty.\n- All analysis fields are appropriately marked as unavailable.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No code, no analysis possible.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, no code provided.\n- All fields indicate no information.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No code, no analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, no code content.\n- The report states no purpose, sources, sinks, or anomalies detectable.\n- Scores: confidence=0, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- No code provided.\n- The report assigns low confidence (0.1), no obfuscation, malware, or security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the lack of code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more detailed; the report assumes typical behavior based on described sources and sinks.\n- It notes no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is higher (0.7), security risk is low (0.2), malware=0.\n- **Assessment:** While the report makes assumptions without actual code, it reasonably concludes no malicious activity based on typical patterns. The low security risk score aligns with this.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of code and appropriately assign zero or minimal scores where applicable.\n- The only point to consider is the **securityRisk** score in report 5: given the lack of actual code, a security risk of 0.2 might be slightly optimistic unless the description explicitly mentions suspicious behavior. However, since the report states no anomalies or suspicious patterns, a low risk score is justified.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation Scores:\n- All reports correctly assign 0 malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with the absence of code and suspicious features.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- Given the absence of actual code, the reports' conclusions are reasonable.\n- The only potential adjustment is in report 5's securityRisk score, which could be lowered to 0, considering no suspicious activity is identified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no signs of obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and appropriate. Without actual code, the risk is minimal, and scores should remain at zero or near-zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review actual code for precise security assessment. These reports correctly reflect the limitations posed by missing code snippets.",
