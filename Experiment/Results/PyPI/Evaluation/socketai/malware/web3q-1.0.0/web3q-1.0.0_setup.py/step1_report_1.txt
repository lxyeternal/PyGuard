  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'web3q' that installs dependencies and executes potentially malicious code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment information (os.name), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', and decrypts and executes code via 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers import of 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it, potentially leading to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed dynamically, obfuscated class and variable names, unusual long description strings, and code execution based on OS detection. The code decrypts and executes code at runtime without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package with deliberately obfuscated class names and description strings. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code dynamically is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with this decrypted payload, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The package metadata appears standard but is paired with risky runtime behavior that could compromise the system.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows, indicating likely malicious behavior. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are strong signals of malicious intent. It should be considered unsafe for use.",
