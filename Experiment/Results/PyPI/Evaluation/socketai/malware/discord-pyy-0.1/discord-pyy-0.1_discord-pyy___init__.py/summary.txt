  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion, with reports 1 and 5 showing signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution that justify moderate concern. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but the indicators warrant cautious review. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence, with a slight adjustment to report 5's malware score to better reflect its suspicious features. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution, and further investigation is recommended before deployment."
