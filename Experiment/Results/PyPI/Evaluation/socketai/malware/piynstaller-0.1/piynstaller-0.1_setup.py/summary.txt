  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and exhibits behaviors consistent with malware or malicious supply chain payloads. It likely aims to escalate privileges, manipulate system files, install backdoors, or perform covert system modifications. Given the heavy obfuscation, system interactions, and conditional logic, it should be classified as malicious with a very high security risk."
