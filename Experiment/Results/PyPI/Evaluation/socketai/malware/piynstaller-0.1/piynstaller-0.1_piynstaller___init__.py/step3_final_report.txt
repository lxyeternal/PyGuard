  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, files, network communication, system commands",
  "sinks": "File writes, network connections, system commands, environment variables",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system calls), potentially via indirect or obfuscated code segments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, indirect code patterns, minimal suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The provided reports indicate mostly benign code with standard data processing and environment interactions. No concrete malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are observed. Obfuscation is minimal and present only in some reports, justified by indirect code patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the described code and analysis. Slight obfuscation and indirect code patterns justify a marginal increase in malware and obfuscation scores, but no definitive malicious activity is detected. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting the limited code context but no suspicious indicators. Overall, the security risk remains low, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no significant security threats or malware detected. Minor obfuscation in some reports is noted but does not elevate concern. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
