{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script designed for data processing or manipulation, potentially part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, files, or network sources (if present). Specific input sources are not clearly visible due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Writes to files, outputs to console, or sends data over network connections (if present). No explicit sinks are identifiable from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or files to processing functions, then potentially to sinks like output streams or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident in the provided snippet. Lack of visible dynamic code execution or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is mostly standard and does not show signs of malicious behavior. It lacks explicit network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The absence of concrete input/output operations limits thorough source-to-sink flow analysis. Without additional context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard and does not contain malicious intent. Confidence is moderate due to limited information.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
