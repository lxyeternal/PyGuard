{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a sample or template for a Python script, but no specific purpose is explicitly defined within the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables and possibly user input via standard input; no explicit data sources are evident in the code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of environment variables and data passed to functions; no explicit dangerous sinks like network connections or file modifications are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions into variables; no further flow towards sinks such as network, file, or system commands is observable in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not include operations that could indicate malicious intent. It reads environment variables and possibly user input, but without any processing that suggests malicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious constructs. Lack of visible dangerous sinks or malicious logic suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple, with no suspicious patterns detected. It appears safe, but limited context restricts absolute certainty.",
