      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicative of malicious or backdoor activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is compromised by this hidden behavior. All evidence points to a high security threat, warranting treating this package as malicious until further analysis (e.g., decoding the PowerShell command) confirms its intent."
