  "purpose": "Implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading data from socket via sock_recv, sock_sendall; resolving addresses using getaddrinfo; reading configuration (host, port, user credentials).",
  "sinks": "Sending data to socket via sock_sendall; receiving data via sock_recv; address resolution; potentially processing user credentials.",
  "flows": "Input (host, port, credentials) → address resolution or hostname encoding → sending proxy commands → receiving responses → establishing connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward network operations. No hidden or obfuscated code present. No data exfiltration or unauthorized system actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous use with asyncio. It includes address resolution, connection establishment, and optional authentication. The functions handle network communication, error handling, and address formatting. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident. The code uses standard modules and practices for proxy connections. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for proxy socket communication without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs expected network and address resolution operations in a typical manner without suspicious or harmful logic.",
