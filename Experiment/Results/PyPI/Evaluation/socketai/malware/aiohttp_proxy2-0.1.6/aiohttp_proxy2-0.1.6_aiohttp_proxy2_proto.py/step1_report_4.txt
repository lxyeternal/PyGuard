{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include host and port parameters for proxy and destination addresses, and data received from the network socket during negotiation and communication.",
  "sinks": "Data sent via socket.sendall, socket.connect, and socket.recv; address resolution via getaddrinfo; and exception handling which could influence control flow.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication steps; network data flows from server responses to validation and exception handling; control flow proceeds based on server responses and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Authentication and connection procedures follow standard SOCKS protocol logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. No embedded secret keys or tokens. Error messages and exception handling are standard and do not leak sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and server response handling. The implementation appears standard and compliant with protocol specifications. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The error handling and data flows are typical for network proxy clients. No signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or covert malicious activity are evident. The code focuses solely on establishing proxy connections and does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations beyond its stated purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant network utility module. No malware, sabotage, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
