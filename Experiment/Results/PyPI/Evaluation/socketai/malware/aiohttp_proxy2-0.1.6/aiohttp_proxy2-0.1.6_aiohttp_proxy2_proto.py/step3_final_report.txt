  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, handling address resolution, authentication, and network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from network sockets, resolves hostnames via DNS, and processes protocol-specific negotiation messages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes data during network transmission; no untrusted data sinks such as file writes or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames/IPs) flows through address resolution and protocol negotiation functions, leading to socket connection establishment and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, asyncio-based implementation of SOCKS proxy clients supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. It correctly handles address resolution, authentication, and protocol negotiation with proper exception handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are present. The network operations and protocol adherence are typical for such utilities. The security risks are minimal, mainly related to DNS leaks or proxy misuse, which are inherent to proxy implementations but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the analysis. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
