  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The low malware and risk scores are justified. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no malicious behavior, with DNS resolution possibly leaking info.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The potential DNS info leak is a typical concern but not malicious. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll observations are consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but all very low (0.1–0.2). The code's purpose is clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious features are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the overall assessment aligns with the code review.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to DNS resolution leaks which are typical and not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client for asyncio, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
