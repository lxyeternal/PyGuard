{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate connection through proxies with optional authentication, primarily used for network communication and tunneling.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials provided during class instantiation, DNS resolution via getaddrinfo, and data received from the proxy server.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the proxy server through socket connections, and responses are received and processed from the proxy server. No data is directly written to external locations or files within this code.",
  "flows": "The data flow begins from user inputs (host, port, credentials), proceeds through DNS resolution or IP address handling, then to proxy negotiation and connection establishment, with data passing through socket send/recv operations. Authentication flows (if needed) also follow source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code employs standard socket and asyncio practices. Error handling is appropriate. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden code present. Usage of socket functions and async methods is standard for network proxies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including authentication and address resolution. The classes perform network operations such as connecting, resolving hostnames, and negotiating protocol-specific handshakes. Error handling is correctly implemented, raising relevant exceptions for network or protocol issues. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The code does not include any suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs. It relies solely on standard libraries and well-known patterns for network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs expected proxy negotiation and connection functions securely, without evidence of malware or malicious behaviors.",
