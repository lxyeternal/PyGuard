{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols to enable proxy connections in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include host and port parameters, and potentially user_id, username, password, and hostnames resolved via DNS or local resolution. Data is read from the network via socket.recv calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via sock_sendall, socket connections, and address resolutions. Potential data leakage if sensitive info is mishandled in logs or exception messages.",
  "flows": "Host/port data flow from parameters -> DNS resolution or direct IP conversion -> proxy negotiation requests -> network data transfer through socket connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. The code uses standard socket operations and proper exception handling. No unusual or obfuscated code is present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for asynchronous socket communication and SOCKS proxy negotiation. It correctly handles address resolution, proxy authentication, and connection establishment. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious payloads are observed. The exception handling is appropriate, and all network operations are performed through the asyncio event loop. The code structure appears clean and maintainable, with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs. The focus is solely on proxy communication without any malicious or privacy-invading behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asyncio-based applications. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior and appears safe for use. The security risk remains very low, with no signs of sabotage or malware present.",
