  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- It performs URL parsing, socket creation, and asynchronous connection establishment.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n- Inputs are validated, and errors are raised appropriately.\n- The functions interact with external modules (`aiohttp_proxy2`) but appear to use standard patterns.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code relies on user-provided data (proxy URLs, host, port), which is typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Validates inputs, parses proxy URL, creates socket, connects, and returns an asyncio connection.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the creation of proxy sockets.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar, focusing on establishing connections via SOCKS proxies.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same general purpose.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar, with emphasis on user input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical evaluation of scores**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is a cautious but reasonable score, considering the code handles untrusted input but doesn't perform malicious actions.\n\n### **Potential adjustments**\n\n- The **risk score** could be slightly lowered to 0.1, as the code itself doesn't introduce significant security concerns beyond typical proxy handling.\n- The **malware score** remains at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and justification**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard proxy handling, minimal security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and cautious. The code is a legitimate utility for SOCKS proxy connection management, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Keep malware score at **0**.\n- Keep obfuscated score at **0**.\n- Slightly reduce security risk to **0.1** for even more conservative assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n\nThis reflects the code's benign, transparent nature and standard functionality.",
