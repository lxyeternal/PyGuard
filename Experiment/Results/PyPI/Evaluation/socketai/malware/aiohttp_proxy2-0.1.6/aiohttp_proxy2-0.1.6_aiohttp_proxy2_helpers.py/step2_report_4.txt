  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Utility functions for SOCKS proxy connection management.\n- Parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- Establishes connections via proxies using asyncio.\n- Validates inputs, raises errors on invalid data.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Proxy utility functions.\n- Findings: Inputs from parameters, sinks in socket connection functions.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, reasonable, and aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Facilitates SOCKS proxy connections.\n- Findings: Inputs from parameters, sinks in network connection functions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Proper validation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, no malicious behavior, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connection setup.\n- Findings: Inputs from parameters, sinks in asyncio connection functions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Well-structured, legitimate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connection utility.\n- Findings: Inputs from parameters, sinks in connection functions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard pattern.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, safe, legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connection utility.\n- Findings: Inputs from parameters, sinks in network connection setup.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity, proper validation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, standard, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code only handles proxy setup and connection establishment with proper validation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, primarily due to reliance on user input and network operations, but nothing alarming.\n\n**Potential concerns (though none are evident here):**\n- If the code were to be used maliciously (e.g., exfiltrating data), that would raise malware concerns. But the code itself is straightforward.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard network code with typical input validation)\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the analysis.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
