  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections, parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and managing network connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as socks_url, host, port, username, password, and other connection settings.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection establishment via sock.connect() and asyncio.open_connection(), which could potentially be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers, which connect to proxies and ultimately establish network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Input validation is appropriate. No unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection setup with proper validation and error handling. It uses external libraries appropriately, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The functions handle user-controlled inputs securely, and the overall structure is straightforward. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
