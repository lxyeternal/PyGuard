{
  "purpose": "Implements a configurable proxy connector for aiohttp, handling proxy URL formation, socket wrapping, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters (host, port, username, password), external helper functions (create_socket_wrapper, parse_proxy_url), network request objects (req).",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, proxy URL usage, socket connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> proxy_url property -> socket creation via create_socket_wrapper -> connection setup in _wrap_create_connection -> request update in connect.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External functions are assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector supporting multiple proxy types and custom DNS resolution. It constructs proxy URLs from parameters, wraps socket creation, and manages connections accordingly. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code's clarity and structure do not suggest obfuscation. External helper functions are not provided but are presumed safe. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
