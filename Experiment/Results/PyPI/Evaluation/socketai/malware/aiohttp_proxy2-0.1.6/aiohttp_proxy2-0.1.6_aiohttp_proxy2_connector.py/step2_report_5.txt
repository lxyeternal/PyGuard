  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; logic and reasoning seem sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code remains consistent with standard proxy handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None apparent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no adjustments.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.2, fitting.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is typical for proxy management.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk at 0.2 is consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the implementation is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; risk is 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports show no obfuscation, scores at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Consistently low at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern given the code's nature.\n\n**Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — a low but non-zero score, considering the code interacts with network sockets and external helpers, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond normal operational considerations.",
