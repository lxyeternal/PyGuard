  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error definitions, and helper functions for establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto; no external input sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points within this code snippet; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines imports and exports, with no runtime data flow, external data processing, or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code structure is straightforward, with standard import/export statements; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, error class definitions, and setting module version and export variables. There are no functions executing untrusted data, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic. The module appears to serve as an interface or API for a proxy connection library, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and typical for such a library.",
