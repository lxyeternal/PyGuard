  "purpose": "This source code appears to define an interface for a SOCKS proxy connection library, including imports, versioning, and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present; the code only sets up module exports and imports functions/classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed; the code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports components and exports them. It includes versioning and organizes symbols for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code structure is standard for Python modules and lacks any malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup script that only manages imports and exports. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
