  "purpose": "Module initializer importing internal components, setting version, and defining public API for a proxy connection library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), setting __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition; no data flow or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export setup with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module setup file, importing classes, errors, helpers, and constants, defining __version__ and __all__. It contains no runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0, with a conservative 0.1 in some reports which is acceptable. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
