  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward `__init__.py` file that imports modules, sets a version, and defines exports. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the report's conclusion.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.  \n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with standard import/export setup for a proxy library. No untrusted data handling or network activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the report.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified as the code is benign but perhaps considering minimal risk due to the context of proxy handling.  \n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, a module setup with imports and exports, no dynamic code or data flow.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — standard code.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security concerns.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar pattern; no suspicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — safe.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as others; pure import/export setup.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, with a minimal 0.1 in one report, which is acceptable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nThis code is a standard module initializer for a proxy connection library. It involves no data processing, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk:** 0 for all, perhaps 0.1 in some cases to account for the context of proxy handling, but still very low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
