{
  "purpose": "Define and expose classes, functions, and error types related to proxy connections, including versioning information.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports modules and defines exports",
  "flows": "Import statements and module attribute definitions; no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and then defines a version string and an __all__ list for exports. There are no input sources, no sinks where untrusted data flows, and no dynamic or obfuscated code present. This appears to be a standard module initialization file setting up exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely organizes and exports internal components for a proxy-related package.",
