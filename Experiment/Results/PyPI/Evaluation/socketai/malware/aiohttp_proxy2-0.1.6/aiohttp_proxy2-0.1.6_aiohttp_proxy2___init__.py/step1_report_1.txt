{
  "purpose": "This source code defines the public API and versioning information for a Python package related to proxy connections, including importing necessary components from other modules.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version declaration, and public API exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only imports modules, defines version, and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily manages imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code structure appears standard for a package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components from local modules, sets a version string, and defines the public API exports. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations in this snippet. The import statements and symbol exports are typical and do not exhibit malicious intent. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward package initializer, defining version info and public API exports without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard, low risk, and likely safe.",
