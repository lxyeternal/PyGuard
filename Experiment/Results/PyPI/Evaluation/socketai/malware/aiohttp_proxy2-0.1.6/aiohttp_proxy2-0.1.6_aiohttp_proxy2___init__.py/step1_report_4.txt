  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components for a SOCKS proxy client, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto; constants like __version__.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication functions present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up module exports and does not contain runtime data flows; no input/output flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary components and exposes them via __all__, setting a module version. No functions or dynamic execution present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization code with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. It simply prepares and exports components for a SOCKS proxy client library.",
