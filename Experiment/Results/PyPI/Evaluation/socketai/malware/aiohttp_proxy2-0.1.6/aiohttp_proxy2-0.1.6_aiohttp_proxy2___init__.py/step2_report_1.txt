  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or module setup file, importing internal components, setting a version, and defining exports.\n- There are no runtime data flows, no untrusted data handling, no network operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is standard, low-risk, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup, which aligns with the actual code. There are no issues like hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - **Malware score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n  - **Security risk:** mostly 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n  - **Obfuscated:** all 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n  \n  These scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for any higher scores:\n\n- Since the code is purely import/export setup with no malicious activity, there's no justification for higher malware or risk scores.\n- The low security risk (0.1 in some reports) might be a conservative default, but given the code's simplicity, even 0.1 seems slightly high; a 0 would be more accurate.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n\n- The reports mention \"securityRisk\": 0.1 in some cases. Given the code, I would suggest this should be 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n- The malware score should remain 0, which it does.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their conclusions. The scores are reasonable, though I would recommend setting the security risk score to 0 for complete accuracy. No modifications needed based on the current code.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscation, and risk scores I assign:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and standard.",
