{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package called 'aiohttp_proxy2', with additional logic to execute obfuscated code upon certain conditions, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.argv for command-line arguments, reading from 'temp.pyw' which contains obfuscated code decoded from base64, and reading version info from '__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded Python script via subprocess.Popen, writing logs to a temporary file, and network-related code embedded in the obfuscated script which could potentially send data externally.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (install or bdist) trigger execution of the obfuscated code via sb_proc, which decodes and runs a hidden script; the script may perform network requests or other actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code encoded in base64, which is decoded and executed dynamically. Usage of shell=True in subprocess.Popen, which can be risky. The code writes logs to a temp file with a fixed filename. The obfuscated script seems complex and could contain malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup tool for a Python package but contains a hidden function 'sb_proc' that decodes and executes a base64-encoded Python script. The obfuscated script, when decoded, appears to contain network operations, request handling, and possible hidden functionalities. The code's use of dynamic code execution and obfuscation techniques suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities. The script triggers this hidden code during certain install commands, which could be used to run malicious payloads unnoticed during package installation. Overall, the code exhibits high suspiciousness due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network interactions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains intentionally obfuscated and dynamically executed code likely intended for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or remote control. While the main setup functions are legitimate, the presence of obfuscated payload and risky execution methods pose significant security concerns.",
