  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, containing a heavily obfuscated payload decoded and executed during package setup, with behaviors indicative of malware, including network activity and stealthy execution. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious or compromised, and further analysis of the payload is recommended before any deployment."
