  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No data processing, external input handling, or runtime logic is present.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an error handling foundation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is harmless, standard, and intended for error management.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are apparent.\n   - The conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` is 1 across all, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is benign, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher risk score would be unjustified unless additional context (e.g., usage in malicious code) was provided.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and stick to the facts: the code only defines exception classes.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate given the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural and non-malicious.\n\n**Final note:** No further action is necessary unless additional context indicates malicious use or obfuscation elsewhere in the project.",
