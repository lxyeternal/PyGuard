  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no data processing, input/output, or dynamic logic.\n   - There are no signs of code anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error handling in a larger application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, justified given the harmless nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports correctly identify no malicious or security issues, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code's purpose is purely structural, with no potential to introduce security vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n   - No signs of malicious activity are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - They do not speculate about hidden malicious intent, which is correct.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect this. No adjustments are necessary.",
