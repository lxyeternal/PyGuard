  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the validity of their claims, the appropriateness of the scores, and considering any potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- The code is static, contains no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and an obfuscated score of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward class definitions with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, purely structural, and standard.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, focusing on the static class definitions.\n- No unwarranted security claims are made.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall,** the code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, benign, and intended for structured exception management.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current assessment aligns well with the code's nature. The exception classes are harmless and standard, with no security concerns.",
