{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flows; just class inheritance hierarchy",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external calls. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The classes serve to categorize different SOCKS proxy error conditions, which is a standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling with no malicious intent or security risks.",
