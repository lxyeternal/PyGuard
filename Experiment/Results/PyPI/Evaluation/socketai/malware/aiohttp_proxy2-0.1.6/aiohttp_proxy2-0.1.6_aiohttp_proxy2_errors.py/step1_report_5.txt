{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions do not include data sources",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows, as these are simple class definitions for exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations. Each class inherits from built-in exception types and serves as specific error identifiers. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a standard and benign part of a larger system that uses exceptions for error management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The structure is clear, and no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error handling and appears to be a benign, non-malicious component with no security risks.",
