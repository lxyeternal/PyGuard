  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward set of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, no risk scores should be higher than 0.\n   - The reports' assessments align with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
