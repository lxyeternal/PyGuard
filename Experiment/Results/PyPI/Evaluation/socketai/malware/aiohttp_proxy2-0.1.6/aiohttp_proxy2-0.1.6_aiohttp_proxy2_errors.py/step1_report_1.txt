  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic flow is present; only class definitions exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. These classes inherit from standard Python exception types and are used for error handling within a larger application or library. There are no dynamic code constructs, no data handling, and no external interactions. The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for exception management. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions used for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and intended for structured exception management.",
