  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance does not involve data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types related to SOCKS proxy errors. It does not process data, read inputs, or perform any runtime logic. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content, and no discrepancies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The reports are accurate, and the scoring appropriately reflects the harmless nature of the code.",
