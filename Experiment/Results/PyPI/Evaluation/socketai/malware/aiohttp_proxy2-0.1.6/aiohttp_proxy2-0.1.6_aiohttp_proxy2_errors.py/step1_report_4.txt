{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a set of exception class definitions with no runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, primarily related to SOCKS proxy errors. No functions, data handling, or logic are present. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The classes serve as error indicators and do not perform any actions or data manipulations. Given the simplicity and purpose, the code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling in proxy-related operations. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
