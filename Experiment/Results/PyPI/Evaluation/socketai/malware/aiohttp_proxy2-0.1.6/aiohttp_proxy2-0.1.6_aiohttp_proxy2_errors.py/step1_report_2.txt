  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No data input, data reading, or external input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, storage, or output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs present; the code appears to be straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types, intended to be used for error handling within a SOCKS proxy implementation or related network code. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The classes serve as a structured way to handle various error conditions in a SOCKS context. Overall, the code is simple, clear, and lacks any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling without any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
