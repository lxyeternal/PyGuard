{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts and executes a payload during installation on Windows, obfuscated with nonsensical class and variable names, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'os.name' condition, importing 'requests' and 'Fernet', and decrypting the hardcoded encrypted payload.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec()' function executing the decrypted code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment info ('os.name'), then on Windows, imports modules, decrypts payload, and executes it via 'exec()'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, hardcoded encryption key, encrypted payload, and runtime execution during setup only on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The code is obfuscated, checks for Windows OS, then decrypts a hardcoded payload with Fernet and executes it via 'exec()'. The obfuscation and encrypted payload suggest malicious intent. The use of 'exec()' on decrypted code during setup is a high-risk behavior, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoors. The static encryption key and payload further indicate malicious concealment. The high scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9-1, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9-1) are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, executing encrypted payloads during installation with obfuscation. Scores are consistent with this behavior, and the package should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious.",
