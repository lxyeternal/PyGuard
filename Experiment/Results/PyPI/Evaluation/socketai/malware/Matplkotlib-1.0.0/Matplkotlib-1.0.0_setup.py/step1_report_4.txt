{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'Matplkotlib' with custom installation behavior that includes executing encrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules (requests, fernet), executing decrypted code with exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which can run arbitrary code on the host system",
  "flows": "The code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it directly during installation on Windows systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted code executed via exec() during installation; obfuscated class name and variable names; absence of clear functionality; decrypts and runs code without validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that installs a package with potentially malicious behavior. The custom install class checks if the OS is Windows, then imports requests and Fernet, and executes decrypted code via exec(). The decrypted payload is unknown but is likely malicious due to its encrypted nature, execution at install time, and absence of validation. The class and variable names are intentionally obfuscated. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a high-risk behavior, indicating potential malware activity. The package name 'Matplkotlib' is a misspelling of 'Matplotlib,' possibly designed to mimic a legitimate package and deceive users. The overall behavior suggests malicious intent to execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The package aims to run hidden code, potentially harmful, at setup time. Due to the encrypted payload and suspicious design, this package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
