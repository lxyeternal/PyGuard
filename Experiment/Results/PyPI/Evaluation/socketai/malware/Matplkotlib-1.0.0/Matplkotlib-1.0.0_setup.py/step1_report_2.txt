{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation command that executes decryption and code execution during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name (checks for Windows), the Fernet decryption key and ciphertext, import statements for requests and Fernet, and the exec() function executing decrypted code",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary and malicious code during installation",
  "flows": "os.name check triggers import of requests and Fernet, decryption of ciphertext, and execution of resulting code via exec() during install on Windows",
  "anomalies": "The use of Fernet to decrypt a ciphertext and execute the resulting code during installation; obfuscated class and variable names; the decrypted code is not visible in source, indicating obfuscation; the exec() call can run arbitrary code, posing a significant security risk",
  "analysis": "The script configures a Python package with intentionally obfuscated code. During installation on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a ciphertext with a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The use of exec() on dynamically decrypted code is a common tactic for malicious payload delivery, especially given the obfuscation and lack of transparency. The code does not reveal what the decrypted payload does, but executing arbitrary code during package installation is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The package metadata appears benign, but the core behavior introduces a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a high-risk malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes code dynamically during installation on Windows systems, which could be used for malicious purposes. The obfuscation, use of exec(), and hidden payload strongly suggest malicious intent. It should be treated as malware, and caution is advised against using this package.",
