{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'Matplkotlib' with custom installation behavior that includes executing encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The source reads from the 'os' module for environment detection, and in the custom install class, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet'. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(). The decrypted code is likely to be arbitrary and can perform any system action, including malicious activities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves detecting Windows OS, importing modules, decrypting a payload with Fernet, and executing it directly with exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code structure with obfuscated class name 'ialFOqPipkxaprBeNHbFEkArQftMPDTKDgEOzCIjmGyUcshVczePEuMjJqbZgRUTyjmPidpIRKKRswhhGlPkaYuehZBcnxkvaDbB' and encrypted payload. Hardcoded encryption key and encrypted data are suspicious. The use of exec() on decrypted data poses significant security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves to set up a package with a custom install step that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes an embedded payload. The payload is encrypted with Fernet, and both the key and ciphertext are hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of 'exec' to run arbitrary decrypted code can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The overall structure and encrypted payload strongly suggest obfuscation and malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a malicious behavior where, upon installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes arbitrary code, which can be used for unauthorized actions. The hardcoded encrypted payload and the use of exec() are key indicators of malicious intent.",
