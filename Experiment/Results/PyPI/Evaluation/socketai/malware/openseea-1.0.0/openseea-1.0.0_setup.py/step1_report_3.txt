{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'openseea' Python package, including custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and performs an import of requests and fernet modules within a custom install class; also reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code retrieved via Fernet encryption, which can lead to code execution of potentially malicious payload.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows (nt), the code decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(), originating from the encrypted string within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and use of exec() for decrypted code are suspicious. The encrypted payload is embedded directly in the code, which is uncommon and suggests obfuscation. The long description and description fields are nonsensical strings, potentially masking malicious intent or obfuscation. The class name is a nonsensical string, indicating possible obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom install command that, upon execution on Windows systems, decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and use of exec() pose significant security concerns as they allow execution of arbitrary code at install time. The use of encrypted data suggests an attempt to hide malicious code. No other obvious malicious activity is visible, but the presence of obfuscated payload and dynamic code execution is highly suspicious. The long description and description fields are gibberish strings, likely masking malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall structure indicates an attempt to conceal malicious code that executes silently during installation on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and potentially malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing hidden payloads during installation on Windows. The use of encrypted data and exec() suggests malicious intent, possibly to deliver payloads or backdoors at install time. Caution is advised against using this package.",
