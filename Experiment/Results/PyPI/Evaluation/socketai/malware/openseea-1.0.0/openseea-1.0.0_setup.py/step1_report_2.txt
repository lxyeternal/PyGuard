  "purpose": "Set up and install a Python package named 'openseea' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting and executing code via Fernet.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially untrusted code execution based on the Fernet decryption output.",
  "flows": "os.name check → import requests and Fernet → decrypts data with Fernet → executes decrypted code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet decryption to execute potentially encrypted payload during installation, no visible validation or checksum. Decrypted payload is executed directly, which can be malicious. The long description and description are nonsensical strings, possibly obfuscation or noise.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that, upon installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts an encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it with exec(). The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string. This behavior is suspicious because it decrypts and executes code at install time, which could be malicious. The overall setup includes normal package metadata but the core logic indicates potential malicious activity. The long description and description fields are nonsensical, likely to obfuscate or mask malicious intent. The use of runtime decryption and execution is a significant red flag, suggesting potential malicious code execution during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. This is a high-risk behavior indicative of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. The package could run harmful code on target systems without detection. Due to the execution of decrypted code during install, this package should be considered unsafe until further analysis of the payload.",
