{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that, on Windows, decrypts and executes a payload during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and contains hardcoded encrypted payloads and keys.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoors.",
  "flows": "Source: os.name check and hardcoded payload; Sink: exec() of decrypted code; Flow: OS check → import modules → decrypt payload → execute payload.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, nonsensical description strings, hardcoded encryption key and payload, conditional execution only on Windows, use of exec() on decrypted data.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated class that, during Windows installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a hardcoded payload with a static key, and executes it via exec(). The long, meaningless description strings and nonsensical class name suggest obfuscation. The decrypt-and-execute pattern is a classic malicious tactic, indicating high malicious potential. The high malware score (0.9), obfuscation score (0.8), and risk score (0.9) are justified based on these behaviors. The code's behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, and the encrypted payload's content remains unknown but suspicious. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall conclusion is that this package is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads supporting malicious intent. The high scores are justified, and the package should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious for further review.",
