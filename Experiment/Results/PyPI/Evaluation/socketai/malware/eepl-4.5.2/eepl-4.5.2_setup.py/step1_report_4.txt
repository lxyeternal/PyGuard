{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and, during installation, attempts to send environment information and download and execute a file from a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', HTTP GET requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'",
  "sinks": "Opening and executing a downloaded executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system('start '+filename)",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET request -> Downloads executable -> Executes the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Unconditionally attempts to send environment data and download/run an executable during package installation without user consent or validation, presence of remote URLs that could be malicious, using a broad try-except block that suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, and if on Windows, downloads and executes an executable from a remote server. The execution is triggered during the 'PostInstallCommand', which runs after installation. The URLs used are suspicious, and executing downloaded files without verification constitutes malicious behavior. The broad exception handling masks errors, making detection more difficult. The code performs network communication and executes external code during installation, both typical signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by transmitting environment data and downloading/executing remote executables without user consent, indicating high malicious intent. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
