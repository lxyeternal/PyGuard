{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and executes a custom post-installation process that involves fetching data from a remote server and potentially executing a downloaded file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; accessing external URLs via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe'; executing the downloaded file using os.system.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs are used as sources; the retrieved content is saved as an executable file and then run, constituting a data flow from external sources to local system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code behavior includes fetching external content and executing a downloaded file without validation; use of a potentially malicious URL ('python-release.com') and executing an EXE file during installation. The try-except block suppresses errors silently, which can hide malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a 'send' function that accesses the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it as part of a GET request to a suspicious URL ('linkedopports.com'). It then conditionally downloads and executes an executable file from another suspicious URL ('python-release.com') if running on Windows. The setup configuration uses a custom post-install class that triggers this 'send' function during installation. The behavior of downloading and executing an external file during package installation is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity, such as delivering malware or backdoors. The use of silent exception handling further conceals any errors, which can be exploited to hide malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by executing external code during package installation, with suspicious URLs and execution of downloaded files. It is likely malicious or at least extremely risky, designed to compromise the host system during installation.",
