{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes an installation process which may execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file with os.system() which runs an executable on Windows.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read, then a GET request is sent to a remote server, then an executable is downloaded and executed if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Code attempts to send environment info to a suspicious domain, downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable during install, uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors silently, and the URL domains appear suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages for package configuration, along with requests for network activity. It defines a send() function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends this info to a remote URL, then downloads and executes a file if on Windows. The execution of a downloaded executable during installation is highly suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent such as remote code execution, system compromise, or backdoor installation. The broad exception handling masks errors, increasing difficulty in detection. The setup configuration runs this code during install, embedding malicious behavior into the package lifecycle.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info, communicating with a suspicious domain, downloading, and executing a potentially harmful executable during package installation. This poses a high security risk, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
