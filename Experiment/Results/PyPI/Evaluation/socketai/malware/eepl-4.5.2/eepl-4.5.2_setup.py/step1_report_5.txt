{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with custom post-install behavior that involves sending environment information and downloading/executing an external file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs via requests.get",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) executes downloaded file, potential data exfiltration via HTTP request",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to send data -> Downloaded file executed via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except without specific exception handling; downloading and executing an external executable during installation; suspicious URL patterns and file names; no validation or verification of downloaded content",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL, potentially leaking system information. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it without validation, which is a common technique for malware. The use of os.system to run the file and the inclusion of network activity during setup are concerning. The exception handling is broad and suppresses errors, possibly to hide failures or malicious activity. Overall, the script exhibits behaviors typical of malicious supply chain attacks, such as stealthy data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious intent by collecting system info, exfiltrating it, downloading, and executing external malware during package installation. It poses a significant security risk.",
