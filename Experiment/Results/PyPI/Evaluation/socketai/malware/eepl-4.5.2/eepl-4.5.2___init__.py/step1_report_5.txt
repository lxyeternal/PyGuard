  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes a hardcoded print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement is a sink, but it does not handle untrusted data or pose security risks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists, as the function contains only a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a fixed message 'installed'. It then calls the function immediately. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple print operation with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a basic, harmless script.",
