  "purpose": "Simple function to print a message indicating installation",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code executes a predefined function call",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output, not a security sink",
  "flows": "Function call ina() triggers the print statement, no untrusted data involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a static message 'installed' and immediately calls this function. There are no data inputs, no external dependencies, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward, simple, and contains no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, benign script that outputs a message. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks identified.",
