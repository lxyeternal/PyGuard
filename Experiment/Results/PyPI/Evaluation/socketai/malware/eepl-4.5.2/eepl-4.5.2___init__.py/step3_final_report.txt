  "purpose": "A simple script defining a function that prints 'installed' and then calls it.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code with no data sources.",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; static output only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is trivial, defining a function 'ina()' that prints a message and then invoking it. It involves no external data, no data flow, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and harmless. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. No logical errors or flaws are present in the assessments. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial script with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
