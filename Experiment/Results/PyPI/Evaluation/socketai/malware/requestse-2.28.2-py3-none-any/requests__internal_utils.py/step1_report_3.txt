{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for internal use in the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'string' in 'to_native_string' and 'u_string' in 'unicode_is_ascii'. It also reads class attributes and regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the 'decode' method in 'to_native_string' and 'encode' in 'unicode_is_ascii', which handle string encoding/decoding operations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded to native strings in 'to_native_string'. In 'unicode_is_ascii', a unicode string is encoded to ASCII to check for ASCII compliance. These are simple input-to-processing flows with no external or untrusted data flow noted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious regex patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses straightforward regex validations and string conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string handling and header validation. The regex patterns are standard for header name/value validation. The 'to_native_string' function converts various input types to a native string, assuming ASCII encoding by default. The 'unicode_is_ascii' function verifies if a unicode string contains only ASCII characters by attempting to encode it in ASCII, catching exceptions if not. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive operations are present. The code is clean, simple, and uses standard Python practices with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for header validation and string conversion, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs safe, expected operations without side effects.",
