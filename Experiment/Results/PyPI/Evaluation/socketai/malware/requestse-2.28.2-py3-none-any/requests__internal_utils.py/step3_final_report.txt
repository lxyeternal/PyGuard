  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for header name and value validation; input parameters to functions (strings, bytes).",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform internal validation and conversion without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or str) flows into to_native_string and unicode_is_ascii functions, with decoding or validation steps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard regex and string handling, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex for header validation, a string conversion function that decodes bytes to native strings, and an ASCII check. All functions are standard, safe, and serve internal validation purposes. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. Regex patterns are correct and used solely for validation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The malware score is 0, risk score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for header validation and string handling, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with appropriate scoring. No further action needed.",
