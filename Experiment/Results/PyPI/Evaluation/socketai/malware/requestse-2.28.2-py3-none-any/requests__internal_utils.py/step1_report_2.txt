{
  "purpose": "Provides internal utility functions for the Requests library, mainly for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "Imports re for regex operations, and imports builtin_str from a compat module. No input reading sources are present within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions are utility helpers for string manipulation and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The regex patterns are standard for header validation, and the string functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines regex patterns for header validation, a function to convert strings to native strings, and a function to check if a unicode string is ASCII. All operations are standard, safe, and do not involve external data or sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code serves utility purposes only and does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be benign utility code with no malicious intent. It contains no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The functions are safe, straightforward, and typical for handling string validation and conversion in the context of HTTP headers.",
