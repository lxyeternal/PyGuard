  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling imports and Python version differences.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and optional dependencies ('chardet', 'simplejson') with fallbacks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The code only manages imports and sets version flags; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for the 'requests' library, handling Python 2/3 differences, optional dependencies, and import resolution. It performs no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for such purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. All dependencies are handled gracefully, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
