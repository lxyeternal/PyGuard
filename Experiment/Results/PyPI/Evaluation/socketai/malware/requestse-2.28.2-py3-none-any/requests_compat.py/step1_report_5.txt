{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility imports for handling various Python versions and modules, primarily for the requests.compat module.",
  "sources": "Imports standard and third-party modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data directly; no data leak points or insecure data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code primarily manages imports and compatibility shims without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, handling imports and compatibility without unusual patterns or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of modules (chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json), manages Python version detection, and sets compatibility variables. It imports standard libraries and defines type aliases. No data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely utility and compatibility code, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign part of a compatibility layer for a Python package.",
