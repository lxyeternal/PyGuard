{
  "purpose": "Compatibility and import resolution for Python 2 and Python 3, along with fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib modules)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No use of untrusted input or network connections.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; primarily static import resolution and compatibility handling.",
  "anomalies": "Standard compatibility code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on handling compatibility between Python 2 and 3, importing optional modules with fallbacks, and defining common types for cross-version support. It does not perform any network activity, file access, or data processing that could be malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. All imports and logic are typical for maintaining compatibility in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to ensure proper imports and version handling without executing any untrusted or harmful operations.",
