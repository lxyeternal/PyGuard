  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for the `requests` library, handling Python version differences and optional dependencies.\n- All reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code only performs import resolution, version detection, and type aliasing, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above; consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Correct; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations; thorough and correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar reasoning; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others; consistent assessment.\n- **Scores:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard compatibility module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No adjustments needed.",
