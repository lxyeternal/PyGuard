{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling imports and Python version differences in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request), optional third-party library 'chardet', and local variables.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly handles imports and compatibility assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and primarily standard compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and attempts to import 'chardet' with fallback to 'charset_normalizer'. It defines Python version checks and conditional imports for 'simplejson'. It maintains compatibility with older Python versions by importing specific modules and functions. No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present that could be malicious. Overall, this appears to be a benign compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import resolution layer for the 'requests' library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is safe and typical for library support code.",
