{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for requests library, handling different Python versions and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet/charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow involving untrusted input; primarily setup and compatibility code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson) with fallback options. It detects Python version and sets flags accordingly. Imports standard libraries for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a compatibility shim for the requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with standard imports and version checks. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
