  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code offers cookie compatibility utilities; sources are internal modules and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Functions handle cookie extraction, header creation, removal, and setting, with internal data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected. The code is standard cookie management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility, high confidence (0.9), malware and obfuscated scores at 0, risk at 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard cookie handling functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal manipulation, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, very high confidence (0.95), malware score at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management; no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal data manipulation, no external or malicious interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious code; standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility, maximum confidence (1.0), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling and compatibility; no untrusted external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal cookie creation, extraction, and header generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (1.0), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utility functions; sources are request and response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, setting, and merging—internal operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard, well-structured cookie management utilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are uniformly 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as no external or system-level operations are present.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are thorough, justified, and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, primarily due to the utility nature; no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
