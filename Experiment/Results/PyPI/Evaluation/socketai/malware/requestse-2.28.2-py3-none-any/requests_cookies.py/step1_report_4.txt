  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, setting, deletion, and conversion between formats.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include HTTP response headers, request objects, and dictionaries for creating or updating cookies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cookie creation, modification, and deletion functions; cookie header generation; and cookie extraction into jars.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into cookie jars; cookies are added or removed based on input data; cookie headers are generated for requests; and cookies are merged or copied between jars.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden network activities, or malicious system manipulations. The code primarily handles cookie management and compatibility, with no hidden or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured with clear functions dedicated to cookie management tasks, including converting between cookies and dicts, handling cookie headers, and maintaining cookie jars. It imports standard modules and handles threading safely. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions perform expected, benign operations related to cookie handling, and there are no signs of malicious backdoors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for cookie management within the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is designed for compatibility and utility without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
