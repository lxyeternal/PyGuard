  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for cookie handling, importing standard modules and internal utils.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious external data or network activity; functions perform standard cookie extraction, creation, and management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is a legitimate utility module.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — consistent with benign utility code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on cookie extraction and manipulation.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external network or file operations; standard cookie handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility layer for cookie management.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Internal operations, no external data or suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, benign cookie utilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie extraction, setting, merging, and conversion.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external network or malicious code; operations are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious external interactions; standard handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate. No indicators of sabotage or supply chain compromise are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-documented utility module for cookie management in the requests library.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration observed.\n- The functions operate solely on internal data structures, with no network or file system manipulation beyond standard cookie handling.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese are consistent with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for cookie management with no signs of compromise or malicious intent. The scores should reflect this assessment.",
