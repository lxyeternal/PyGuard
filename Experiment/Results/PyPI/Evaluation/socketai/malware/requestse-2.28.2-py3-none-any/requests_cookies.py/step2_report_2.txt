  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the assessment details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as cookie compatibility utilities, importing internal modules and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focused on cookie extraction, header management, and cookie removal; no external network or file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses threading locks and serialization appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates the code as legitimate utility code with high confidence (0.9). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The malware score should remain at 0, and obfuscated at 0. Given the high confidence, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard cookie utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal cookie handling; no external data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Functions operate on standard data structures.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95). No malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0.0. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; utility functions for cookie management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal cookie creation, manipulation, and serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. Scores remain appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as cookie compatibility utilities.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, manipulation—all within standard scope.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0). No malware or security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; utility functions for cookie handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal cookie management, header creation, and extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still valid.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is a standard utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — standard utility code with negligible security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.",
