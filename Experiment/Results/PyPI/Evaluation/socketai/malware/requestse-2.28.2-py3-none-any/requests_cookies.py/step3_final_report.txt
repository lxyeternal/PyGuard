  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie management, extraction, header creation, and cookie jar manipulation within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Internal modules, standard libraries, request and response objects, HTTP headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction, header generation, cookie setting/removal, internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input request/response objects -> internal cookie handling functions -> cookie jar updates or header outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard cookie management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured cookie utility functions used in the requests library. It handles cookie extraction, creation, merging, and management without external network or file system access. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The functions operate solely on internal data structures and headers, with appropriate use of threading locks and serialization. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are justified based on the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cookie management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe within its intended scope.",
