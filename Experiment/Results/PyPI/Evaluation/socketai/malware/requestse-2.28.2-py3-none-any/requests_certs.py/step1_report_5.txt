{
  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'certifi' library's 'where' function provides the path to the CA bundle; executed when the script runs.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'where()', which outputs a file path; this could be used to locate certificate files but is not inherently unsafe.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> execution of 'print(where())' in main block; data flows from library function to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. The script simply outputs a path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi' and prints its output when run directly. No data manipulation, user input, or network activity occurs. The code performs a straightforward task without any obfuscated or malicious code. It doesn't access sensitive data, execute untrusted code, or contain backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from certifi. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It serves a legitimate purpose related to TLS certificate management.",
