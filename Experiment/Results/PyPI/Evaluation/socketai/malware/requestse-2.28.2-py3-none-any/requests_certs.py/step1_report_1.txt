{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package to obtain the CA bundle path via 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path to standard output when executed directly.",
  "flows": "The source is the call to 'where()' from certifi, and the sink is the 'print' statement that outputs this path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi to determine the CA bundle location, and if run as a script, prints this path. It contains no external inputs, no data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and intended for configuration or informational purposes. No security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA certificate bundle path. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
