{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> execute print(where()) -> output CA bundle path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for fetching CA bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known, trusted library (certifi) to retrieve the path to the CA certificates bundle. It then prints this path when run as a script. No user input is processed, and there are no data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors. The code is simple, intended for utility purposes, and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script to display the default CA bundle path from the certifi package. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
