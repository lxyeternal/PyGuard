{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports from certifi package (where function), print statement in main block.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print output in main execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of certifi to output CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path if executed as a script. The implementation is simple and intended to reveal the CA bundle location, likely for informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The only operation is reporting a static resource location.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving as a utility to display the CA bundle path from certifi. There is no malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified.",
