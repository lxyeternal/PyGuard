  "purpose": "To output the default CA certificate bundle path used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from certifi, executed when run as a script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints a value, no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from certifi -> print(where()) when executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The purpose is purely informational. All security signals are benign, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that reports the location of the CA bundle from certifi. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
