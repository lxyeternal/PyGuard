  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the certifi package; calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'where()' is printed to standard output; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path, which is then printed. This is a straightforward source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library (certifi) and outputs the location of the CA bundle. It contains no untrusted data handling, no network communication, and no malicious logic. The code's purpose appears to be to display the CA bundle path for informational or configuration purposes. The structure is simple and conventional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a simple retrieval of a trusted CA bundle location. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
