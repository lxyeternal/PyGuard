{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor arguments and method calls such as update, get, __getitem__, and __init__.",
  "targets": "Methods that access or modify internal dictionaries: __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, copy, and get.",
  "flows": "Input data (constructor or update) -> internal _store or __dict__ -> accessed via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily implements standard data structures with case-insensitivity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which provides a case-insensitive dict-like object, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary with a name attribute. Both classes use standard Python data handling patterns. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data processing is present. The code does not contain obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs. It appears to be standard, well-documented, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries for internal use within a library. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
