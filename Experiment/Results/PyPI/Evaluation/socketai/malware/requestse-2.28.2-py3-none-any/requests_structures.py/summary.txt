  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing common data structures for internal use with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minor bug in the copy() method is a correctness issue, not a security concern. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate as zero. The only adjustment is to note the bug for correctness, but it does not impact security assessment."
