  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary and lookup dictionary used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), key access methods (__getitem__, get), and update method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no output, network, or data exfiltration code.",
  "flows": "Data is stored internally in _store (for CaseInsensitiveDict) and in __dict__ (for LookupDict), with key normalization for case insensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code strictly implements standard data structure behaviors with case-insensitive key handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard, well-structured, and do not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. No external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution. The methods perform standard dictionary operations, with the primary purpose of managing headers or lookup values case-insensitively. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionary data structures used within the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
