      "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that reports the location of the CA bundle from certifi. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, transparent, and standard implementation of an HTTP request/response module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the nature of the code as a core library component."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation via multiple base64-encoded 'exec()' calls, which could execute malicious payloads. While the surrounding setup appears legitimate, the obfuscated parts pose a high security risk. Further analysis of the decoded payloads is necessary to confirm malicious intent. Until then, this code should be treated as potentially malicious with high caution."

      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing common data structures for internal use with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The minor bug in the copy() method is a correctness issue, not a security concern. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate as zero. The only adjustment is to note the bug for correctness, but it does not impact security assessment."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for backward compatibility, employing techniques that are unusual but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation and security risk due to module aliasing. No active malicious activity is evident, but the techniques could be exploited if environment security is compromised."
