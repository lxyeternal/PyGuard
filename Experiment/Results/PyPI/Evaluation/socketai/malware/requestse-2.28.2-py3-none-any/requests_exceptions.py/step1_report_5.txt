  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes related to HTTP requests, errors, and warnings for the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and imports; no direct input sources are used within this module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks, as the code only defines exception classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard for exception handling and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions and defines custom exception classes for HTTP request errors, warnings, and related error handling. It adheres to normal structure, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The classes extend built-in exceptions and incorporate external exceptions in a standard manner. There are no suspicious code constructs, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions and imports, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of the Requests library's error handling framework.",
