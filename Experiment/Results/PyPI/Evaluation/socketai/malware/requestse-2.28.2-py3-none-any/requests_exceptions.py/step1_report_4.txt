{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external data through exception handling, potentially from network responses or user input when errors occur.",
  "sinks": "Error classes could be used to raise exceptions based on untrusted data, but no direct data sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and raised during network request processing; no explicit source-to-sink data flows are evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines exception classes and inheritance hierarchies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a network request library. It imports exceptions from third-party modules and defines various custom exception subclasses. The class constructors and inheritance follow typical patterns, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration. All code appears to be straightforward, primarily defining error types for the library to use during error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical implementation of exception classes for a Python HTTP request library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code patterns, and no signs of malware. It simply defines error types to be used by the library. The risk is negligible, and no security concerns are evident.",
