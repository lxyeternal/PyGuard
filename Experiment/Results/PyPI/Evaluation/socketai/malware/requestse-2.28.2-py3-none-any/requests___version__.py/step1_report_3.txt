  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely metadata declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only metadata with no suspicious or unusual behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative emojis. There are no input/output operations, no execution of dynamic code, and no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. The content appears standard for Python package metadata, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard metadata for the 'requests' package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package info declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
