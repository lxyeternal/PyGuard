{
  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, including descriptive variables and decorative comments.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.) and comments in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata variables do not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment without dynamic or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comment and Unicode emojis (__cake__), which are decorative and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static variable assignments defining package information, with no functions, input/output, or executable logic. The ASCII art and emojis are stylistic and do not introduce security concerns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores and analysis are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
