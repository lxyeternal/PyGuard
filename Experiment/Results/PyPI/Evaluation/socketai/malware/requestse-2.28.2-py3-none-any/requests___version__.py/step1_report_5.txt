  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used or leaks occur",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; this is metadata only",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art at the top, which is decorative but unusual in production code",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains package metadata variables defining name, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative ASCII art. No input, output, data processing, or executable logic is present. The ASCII art does not influence code execution and appears to serve an aesthetic purpose. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is static and only describes package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as metadata documentation for the requests library. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
