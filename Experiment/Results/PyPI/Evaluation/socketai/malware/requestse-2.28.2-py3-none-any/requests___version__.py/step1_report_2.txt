  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, and __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns static string and numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes ASCII art comment and a Unicode emoji string (__cake__), which are harmless and standard for package metadata. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata definitions for a Python package, with no input processing, data handling, or execution logic. It does not contain any code that could be exploited or that exhibits malicious behavior. The inclusion of ASCII art and emojis is typical in some open-source projects and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves only as metadata for the 'requests' package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
