  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for backward compatibility, employing techniques that are unusual but not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation and security risk due to module aliasing. No active malicious activity is evident, but the techniques could be exploited if environment security is compromised."
