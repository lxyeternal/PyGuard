  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the module as handling request/response creation, with sources being user inputs and internal functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that data flows through encoding and request preparation to transmission, with response data being read via streaming and JSON parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Code Quality:** Finds no suspicious or malicious patterns; code relies on standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes a very low security risk (0.1), with high confidence (0.9), no obfuscation, and no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The score of `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0.1` are reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the module's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Identifies data flow from user inputs into encoding and request building, with response handling via streaming.\n- **Anomalies & Code Quality:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also concludes a very low security risk (0.2), high confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores align with the analysis; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes data flow from parameters into encoding, URL processing, and response parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Code Quality:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Again, low security risk (0.1), high confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from inputs into request construction and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Code Quality:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk at 0, malware at 0, very high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes data flow into encoding, headers, cookies, and response processing.\n- **Anomalies & Code Quality:** No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Security risk at 0.2, malware at 0, confidence at 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** All `0`, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which is appropriate given the standard nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, consistent with standard request handling code.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard secure implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No evidence of malicious intent or security issues is present in this code snippet.",
