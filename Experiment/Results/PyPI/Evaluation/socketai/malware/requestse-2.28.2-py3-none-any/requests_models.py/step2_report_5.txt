  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and the consistency of scores with the detailed descriptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP request/response handling, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is very low (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed appears to be a straightforward implementation of a well-known library (requests), with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors. The detailed reasoning aligns with the low malware and obfuscated scores.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request construction, encoding, and response handling, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms the absence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk score (0.2) is slightly higher than Report 1 but still reflects a minimal risk, perhaps due to the inherent complexity of request handling.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as a standard, secure implementation with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score remains 0, and confidence is high.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code's nature. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Continues the pattern of recognizing the code as a standard, secure request/response handler with no malicious or obfuscated code. The confidence is perfect (1.0), malware score 0, and security risk minimal.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning matches the code's characteristics.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirming the code's legitimacy, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Slightly higher security risk (0.2), possibly due to the general nature of request handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's structure.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content—no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:** Based on the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client library, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n- **Additional note:** The detailed reasoning across all reports is consistent and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (as per reports, acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk beyond minimal inherent complexity.",
