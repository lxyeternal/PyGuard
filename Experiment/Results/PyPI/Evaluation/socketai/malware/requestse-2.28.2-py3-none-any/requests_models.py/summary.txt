  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, transparent, and standard implementation of an HTTP request/response module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the nature of the code as a core library component."
