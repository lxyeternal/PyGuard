{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via os.uname, os.expanduser, os.environ, and os.getcwd.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network using urllib.request to a remote URL.",
  "flows": "System info (sources) is collected and encoded, then transmitted to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes system and environment data, possibly for exfiltration. The URL used for request appears suspicious due to custom headers and URL parameters. No validation or encryption is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers potentially sensitive system info, encodes it with base64, and transmits it to a remote server. The data collection includes hostname info, user directory, environment variables, and current working directory, which are typical for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The request is constructed with custom headers and an encoded payload. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payload execution, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration without user consent. The code does not perform any malicious actions on the system itself, but it does collect and transmit data potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covert data collection and exfiltration, which could be malicious depending on context. There are no active destructive or backdoor behaviors, but the data harvesting and transmission pattern is suspicious and warrants caution.",
