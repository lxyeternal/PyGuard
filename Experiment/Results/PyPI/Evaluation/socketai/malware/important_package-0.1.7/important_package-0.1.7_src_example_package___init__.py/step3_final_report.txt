{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, user directory, environment variables, current directory), encodes it in base64, and transmits it via an HTTP request to a remote server, potentially for covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.uname(), os.path.expanduser('~'), os.environ, os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "request.Request() with data payload, request.urlopen() to external URL",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info) -> data encoding -> HTTP request with encoded data -> remote server",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling suppresses errors; data is transmitted without user consent; suspicious URL and headers suggest covert exfiltration; no obfuscation in code structure",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info, encodes it with base64, and sends it via HTTP POST to a remote URL with custom headers. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present. The broad exception handling can hide errors. The data collection and transmission pattern is consistent across reports, indicating potential privacy invasion. The URL and headers are suspicious but not definitively malicious. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.2-0.4, risk 0.4-0.6) are justified given the behavior. No obfuscation is evident. The main concern is covert data exfiltration without user consent, which warrants a higher security risk but not a high malware score.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious privacy-invasive behavior through covert system info collection and transmission but does not contain active malicious payloads or code execution. The behavior justifies moderate security concern but not active malware. The scores in reports are appropriate; a malware score of around 0.3 and risk score of approximately 0.55 reflect the behavior accurately.",
