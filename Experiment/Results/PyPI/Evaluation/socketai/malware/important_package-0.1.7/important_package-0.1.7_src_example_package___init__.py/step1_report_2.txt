  "sinks": "HTTP request to 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' with encoded data payload",
  "flows": "Source data (system info) is collected, encoded in base64, then sent via POST request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info encoded in base64 to an external server without user consent; the URL and host headers seem obfuscated or suspicious",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as hostname, user home directory, environment variables, and current working directory. These are packaged into a JSON object, base64-encoded, and sent as a request body to a URL mimicking PyPI. The URL path and host header suggest possible obfuscation or misuse, and the code does not include any user prompts or safeguards. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration of system info, potentially malicious if done without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system information to an external server covertly. While it does not execute malicious actions like file modification or code execution, its data collection and transmission pattern suggest malicious intent related to privacy invasion or data exfiltration. The suspicious URL and headers raise concern about covert communication.",
