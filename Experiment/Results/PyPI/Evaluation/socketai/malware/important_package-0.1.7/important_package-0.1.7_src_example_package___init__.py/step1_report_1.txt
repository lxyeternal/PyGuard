  "purpose": "Collects system information and encodes it for transmission to a remote server.",

  "flows": "System info collected from sources, encoded with base64, sent via HTTP POST request to remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling which may hide errors; encodes sensitive system info; sends data to an external server without clear user consent",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, user home directory, environment variables, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64. It constructs an HTTP request to a remote URL with this data, potentially leaking system info. The request uses a custom 'Host' header. Exception handling is broad, hiding potential errors. The code does not perform any malicious actions like data theft or executing harmful commands but does collect and transmit sensitive environment data without transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect environment and system data and send it to an external server, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. There are no direct malicious behaviors like code execution, data exfiltration of user data beyond environment info, or malicious commands, but the data collection and transmission without user awareness is suspicious.",
