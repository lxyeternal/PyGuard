  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review for Security Issues:**\n   - The setup script appears standard. It reads a README file for the long description and uses `setuptools.setup()` with typical parameters.\n   - The only dependency specified is `'dnspython'`, which is a common package. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No code injection, dynamic code execution, or other security vulnerabilities are evident here.\n   - The package directory is set to `\"src\"`, which is a common practice, and the package requirements specify a minimum Python version of 3.6.\n\n2. **Error and Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - All reports have the error \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n   - This suggests that the reports did not contain any substantive analysis, possibly due to a failure in the reporting tool or an incomplete report submission.\n   - Therefore, there is no additional information or reasoning to evaluate from these reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no issues or malicious activity are identified, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be minimal, as there's no evidence of code obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should reflect the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior; thus, it should be close to zero.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern could be the dependency on `dnspython`, which, if compromised, could pose a risk. However, there's no evidence here that the dependency is malicious or compromised.\n   - The code itself is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and the lack of detailed reports, I would assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to dependency management, but not risky in itself)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears safe and standard.\n- The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of issues.\n- Scores should be very low, reflecting no detected malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Assign a very low risk score (~0.1) to account for general dependency considerations, but overall, the package seems secure.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a detailed report or further analysis!",
