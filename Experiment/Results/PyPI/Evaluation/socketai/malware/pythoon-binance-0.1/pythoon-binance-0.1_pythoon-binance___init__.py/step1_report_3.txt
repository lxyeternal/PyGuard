  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without actual code provided, the exact intent cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "The code may read input from function parameters, environment variables, or external files, but no specific source code is provided to identify these points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network requests, file writes, or system commands if the code performs such actions, but none are explicitly visible without actual code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, no source-to-sink flow can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "There are no visible anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs in the provided empty input. However, absence of code prevents thorough analysis.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of actual code, no step-by-step analysis is possible. Normally, this would involve checking for hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, suspicious function calls, or unusual behavior, but none can be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for analysis; therefore, no malicious activity or security risks can be determined. The absence of code precludes any suspicious findings.",
