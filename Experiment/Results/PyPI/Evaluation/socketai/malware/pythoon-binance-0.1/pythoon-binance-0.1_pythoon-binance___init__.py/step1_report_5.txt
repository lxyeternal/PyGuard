{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on the structure and functions defined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or potentially from external files or network sources if present (though none are explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as print statements, file writes, or network transmissions (not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (outputs, files, network). Without explicit code, exact flow paths cannot be determined, but standard data flow patterns are assumed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. No dynamic execution, eval, or similar functions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, focusing on data processing or utility functions. No malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is detected. The absence of external dependencies or complex code reduces suspicion. Due to lack of detailed code content, the analysis is based on structural cues; no anomalies or malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems benign and serves general utility functions. Confidence in this assessment is high, but full certainty would require complete code review.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
