{
  "purpose": "The code appears to create a Python package that, upon installation, writes a script which establishes a reverse remote access connection to a specified IP address, potentially allowing full control over the infected machine.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description; the 'remote-access.py' script is written and executed locally during setup; socket operations read network data; subprocess calls execute external commands.",
  "sinks": "The socket connections send and receive command data; subprocess.Popen executes remote shell commands; writing and executing 'remote-access.py' introduces persistent remote control; os.rename and file operations modify local filesystem.",
  "flows": "The setup script writes 'remote-access.py', then executes it via subprocess; the 'remote-access.py' establishes a socket connection to IP '82.157.252.61' and opens a remote shell depending on platform, enabling remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded IP address '82.157.252.61' hardcoded; code creates a reverse shell that connects to this IP; the script runs during installation, executes remote code, and persists by copying to user directory; minimal error handling and obfuscation; the package description and purpose suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to perform remote access by establishing a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address. It writes a separate Python script ('remote-access.py') that, when run, connects back to the attacker's server and provides remote command execution capability. The package's setup process automatically executes this script after installation, making it a persistent backdoor. Hardcoded IP and the nature of remote control code indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscation is present, but the code intentionally implements unauthorized remote access functionalities. These behaviors align with typical remote access trojans (RATs).",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent by embedding a reverse shell that connects to an external IP and automatically runs upon package installation, creating a backdoor. It demonstrates high malicious behavior risk with potential for system compromise. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered dangerous.",
