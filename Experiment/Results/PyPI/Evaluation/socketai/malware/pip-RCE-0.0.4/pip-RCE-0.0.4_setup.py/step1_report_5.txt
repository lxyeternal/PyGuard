{
  "purpose": "The code creates a Python package designed to execute a remote access tool that connects to a specified IP address and establishes a reverse shell, allowing remote control of the host system.",
  "sources": "Reads input/output from socket connections, reads and writes files ('remote-access.py'), and executes subprocesses (e.g., 'python3' to run the script).",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses ('subprocess.Popen'), writes to files ('remote-access.py'), and performs network communication via socket connections (sending/receiving data).",
  "flows": "The code writes the malicious script ('remote-access.py') to the user's directory, then executes it via subprocess, establishing a network connection back to the attacker-controlled IP, enabling remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded IP address ('82.157.252.61'), the reverse shell code within the 'Code' string is designed for remote access, and the package setup automatically downloads and executes a remote access script without user consent. The code also overwrites existing files without explicit warning, and the package description is misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a malicious reverse shell payload within a string, writes it to a file named 'remote-access.py', and automatically executes it upon package installation. It uses threading and subprocess to maintain a persistent connection, enabling remote command execution. The presence of hardcoded IP, automatic script deployment, and execution indicates malicious intent. It bypasses user approval and could be used for unauthorized access or control of affected systems.",
  "conclusion": "This package is malicious, designed to establish unauthorized remote access to systems upon installation. It contains a reverse shell, hardcoded attack IP, and automatic execution mechanisms. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
