{
  "purpose": "The code creates a Python package that, when installed, writes a script for remote access and executes it, effectively providing remote control over the host machine.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'Code' string to write a script to a file; it also reads the README.md file during setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'remote-access.py' script via subprocess.Popen; socket connections and remote command execution are potential sinks.",
  "flows": "The package installation triggers writing and executing 'remote-access.py', which then establishes a network connection to a hardcoded IP address, enabling remote shell access.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds a full remote access backdoor script within a package, hardcodes an external IP address, and automatically executes a script that provides remote shell access without user consent. It also overwrites existing files without warning.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a backdoor payload ('Code') that establishes a reverse shell to a specific IP address, allowing remote command execution. During installation, it writes this code to 'remote-access.py' in the user's directory and attempts to run it automatically. The remote access code, in both Windows and Linux, opens a shell connected to an external server, enabling complete control over the host. The package setup and installation process are manipulated to deploy and execute this malicious code without user knowledge. No legitimate functionality is provided, and the behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by embedding and executing a reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control of the compromised host. It operates covertly, exploiting the installation process to deploy remote access capabilities. The code is highly malicious with high confidence, and it poses an extremely dangerous security risk.",
