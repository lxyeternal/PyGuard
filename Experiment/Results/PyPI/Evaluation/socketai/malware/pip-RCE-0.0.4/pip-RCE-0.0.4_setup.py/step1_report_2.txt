{
  "purpose": "Create a Python package that, upon installation, writes a script enabling remote access to the machine, potentially allowing malicious control.",
  "sources": "Reading system platform info, hostname, and network connection attempts to a hardcoded IP address; writing and executing a remote access script.",
  "sinks": "Executing subprocesses to run remote access code; writing and renaming files; establishing socket connections to a hardcoded IP; running a persistent reverse shell.",
  "flows": "The code gathers environment info, creates a remote access script, writes it to disk, then executes it; the remote script connects to a specific IP and opens a reverse shell, providing remote control.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address ('82.157.252.61') for remote connection, persistent reverse shell code with no user consent, writing a Python script during package install, executing remote code automatically, and attempting to establish persistent remote access without user knowledge.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to execute during the installation process of a Python package. It writes a Python script ('remote-access.py') containing reverse shell functionality that connects back to a fixed IP address ('82.157.252.61') and opens a reverse shell on the target machine. It then moves this script to the user's home directory (or Documents on Windows) and attempts to execute it asynchronously. The embedded script establishes a network connection to the specified IP and provides remote command execution capabilities. The presence of hardcoded IP, automatic script execution, and persistent reverse connection strongly suggest malicious intent, aimed at gaining unauthorized remote access. The code's structure, including aggressive file operations and network activity during package installation, confirms malicious behavior rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish unauthorized remote access to the host system by installing and executing a reverse shell script during installation. The hardcoded IP, automatic execution, and persistent connection capabilities classify this as malware with a high security risk.",
