{
  "purpose": "The code creates a reverse shell backdoor that connects to a hardcoded IP address and executes automatically during package installation, providing remote control to an attacker.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from socket connections, writes a script file ('remote-access.py'), and executes it; it also reads system information and network details.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into socket communication, subprocess execution, and file writing, enabling remote command execution and data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code establishes a socket connection to a remote IP, writes and executes a reverse shell script, and maintains a persistent connection for remote command control.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address, automatic execution during setup, creation of a persistent reverse shell, minimal error handling, and no obfuscation; the code is straightforward but malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly implements a reverse shell backdoor by writing a script ('remote-access.py') that connects to a fixed IP ('82.157.252.61') and executes it during installation. It uses platform-specific methods to establish remote access, with socket communication and subprocess management. The code contains no obfuscation, making its malicious intent clear. The reverse shell provides full remote control, which is a typical malicious behavior. The hardcoded IP and automatic deployment during setup indicate deliberate malicious activity. The code's behavior aligns with known remote access trojans, and the intent is clearly malicious. No vulnerabilities outside this code are exploited; the code itself is malicious. Scores are consistent: malware score of 1, security risk of 1, obfuscated score of 0, and high confidence in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, malicious backdoor establishing persistent remote access via a reverse shell, with hardcoded IP and automatic execution during installation. It poses a severe security threat, and the assigned scores accurately reflect its malicious nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
