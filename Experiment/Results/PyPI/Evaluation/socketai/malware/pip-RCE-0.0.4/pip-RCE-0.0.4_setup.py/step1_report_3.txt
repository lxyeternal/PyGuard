{
  "purpose": "The code installs a package that creates and executes a remote access backdoor, allowing remote control of the infected system via socket connection.",
  "sources": "Code reads and writes files ('remote-access.py'), accesses environment variables (os.path.expanduser), and executes subprocesses (subprocess.Popen, subprocess.call). It also reads network data via socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Execution of remote-access.py script, creation of persistent socket connection, subprocess invocation to open reverse shell, file operations (rename, delete), and subprocess.Popen for executing the backdoor code.",
  "flows": "The setup process writes the malicious code to a file, moves it to the user's directory, then executes it via subprocess. The remote access code establishes a socket connection to a hardcoded IP, then opens a reverse shell depending on the OS, allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address ('82.157.252.61'), the code creates a reverse shell that connects back to this IP, and the code is embedded as a string inside the package's setup process. The code runs during installation, automatically establishing remote access without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script embeds a malicious reverse shell payload within the package setup process, writing it to disk and executing it automatically. It contains OS-specific functions to spawn remote shells, uses hardcoded IP for connecting back, and attempts to establish persistent remote control. The code appears intentionally designed for unauthorized remote access and control, with no legitimate purpose apparent. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, constituting a backdoor designed for remote exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that creates a remote backdoor, enabling unauthorized control of infected systems. The code's behavior includes hardcoded IPs, automatic execution upon installation, and remote command execution features, all indicative of malware used for malicious purposes.",
