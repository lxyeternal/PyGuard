      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior through obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, triggered conditionally. The evidence justifies high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The package should be considered malicious or compromised, warranting removal and further investigation."
