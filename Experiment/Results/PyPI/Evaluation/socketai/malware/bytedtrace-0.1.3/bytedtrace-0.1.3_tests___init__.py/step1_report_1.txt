  "sources": "Imports SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions, and warnings module.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are configured to always trigger for SNIMissingWarning, but no data sinks are explicitly targeted.",
  "flows": "Import of SNIMissingWarning -> warnings.simplefilter(\"always\", SNIMissingWarning) to enforce warning behavior during tests.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally handles the absence of SNIMissingWarning; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up warning filters for a specific urllib3 warning during testing. It includes compatibility handling for different urllib3 versions by catching ImportError. There are no suspicious or malicious actions such as data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The purpose is solely to configure warning behavior for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for testing warning behavior in urllib3. It does not exhibit malicious activity or security risks.",
