  "purpose": "Configure warning filters for SNIMissingWarning during tests to ensure warnings always fire, handling different urllib3 versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from urllib3.exceptions and the warnings.simplefilter call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; only warning configuration",
  "flows": "Import of SNIMissingWarning -> warnings.simplefilter if import succeeds",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward handling of version differences, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import SNIMissingWarning and sets the warning filter to 'always' if successful, ensuring warnings are always triggered during tests. It handles ImportError to maintain compatibility with urllib3 2.0+. No malicious, maliciously obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The code is purely for test setup, with no data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for test warning configuration, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
