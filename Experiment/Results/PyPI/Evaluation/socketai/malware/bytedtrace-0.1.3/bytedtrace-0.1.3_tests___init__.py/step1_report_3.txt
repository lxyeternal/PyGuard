  "purpose": "Configure warnings behavior for SNIMissingWarning in urllib3 during tests.",
  "sources": "Import of SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions, and the warnings.simplefilter call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no data leaks or effect sources.",
  "flows": "Import of SNIMissingWarning flows into the warnings.simplefilter configuration to modify warning behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.simplefilter to alter warning behavior is typical for test setup; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions. If available, it sets the warning filter to always trigger for SNIMissingWarning to ensure warnings are consistently raised during tests. It accounts for differences between urllib3 versions (1.x vs 2.0). No data inputs, outputs, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's intent appears solely to control warning behavior during testing without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign test setup that adjusts warning filters for consistent test behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
