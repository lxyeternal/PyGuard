  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or external interactions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink identified",
  "anomalies": "Conditional handling for ImportError, no suspicious or malicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions. If successful, it sets the warning filter to always trigger for this warning type, which is used in testing environments. If the import fails (e.g., in urllib3 2.0+), it sets SNIMissingWarning to None and proceeds without configuring warnings. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It only manages warning behavior for testing purposes and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended to configure warnings for testing. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
