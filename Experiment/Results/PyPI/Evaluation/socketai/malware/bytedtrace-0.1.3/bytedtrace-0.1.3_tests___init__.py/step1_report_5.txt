  "flows": "Import of SNIMissingWarning -> Setting warnings filter to 'always' for SNIMissingWarning.",
  "anomalies": "The code adjusts warning filters based on urllib3 version, which is typical; no anomalies or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SNIMissingWarning from urllib3.exceptions if available, then forces the warning to always be triggered during tests. If the import fails (urllib3 2.0+), it sets SNIMissingWarning to None and skips the warning filter. The purpose appears solely to ensure the warning triggers during tests; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply modifies warning behavior for testing purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
