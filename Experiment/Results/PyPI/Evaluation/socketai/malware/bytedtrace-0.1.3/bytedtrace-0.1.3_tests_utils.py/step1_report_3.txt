  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads current environment variables via os.environ and the override values from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Modifies os.environ by updating or deleting environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads os.environ at start -> applies overrides based on kwargs -> yields control -> restores environment to original state.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscation observed. The code cleanly manages environment variable changes without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily override environment variables. It saves the current environment, applies the overrides, and then restores the environment after the context exits. The logic is straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, malicious operations, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing environment variables within a context. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
