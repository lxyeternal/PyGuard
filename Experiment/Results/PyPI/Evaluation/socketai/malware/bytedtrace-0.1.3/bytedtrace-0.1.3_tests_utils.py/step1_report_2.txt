  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables within a block of code.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from os.environ to save current state; writes to os.environ to modify environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables in os.environ, which could affect the behavior of other code running in the same process.",
  "flows": "Reads current environment variables -> modifies environment variables within the context -> restores original environment after context ends.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily change environment variables. It securely saves the current environment, applies changes, and restores the original state after the context. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious logic present. The code’s structure is straightforward and aligns with common practices for managing environment variables in tests or controlled environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for managing environment variables temporarily. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
