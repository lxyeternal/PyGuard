  "sources": "Reads current environment variables with os.environ; receives new environment variables via kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Modifies os.environ by deleting or updating environment variables based on provided kwargs.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables at the start, updates or deletes based on kwargs, then restores original environment variables at the end.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code straightforwardly manages environment variables with standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager to temporarily override environment variables. It saves current environment, applies modifications based on input, and restores the original environment after the context. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code employs standard and safe practices for environment management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, standard operation for temporarily changing environment variables within a context. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
