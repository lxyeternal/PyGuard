  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to temporarily override environment variables within a code block.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables with os.environ (saving their state).",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables in os.environ, which could affect subprocesses or other code relying on environment settings.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables, modifies them, and restores original state after block execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code functions as a standard context manager for environment variable management.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the current environment variables, allows temporary modification within a 'with' block, and restores the original environment afterward. It does not perform any data exfiltration, network activity, or execute untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The use of environment variable override is common and safe if used appropriately, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for environment management, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
