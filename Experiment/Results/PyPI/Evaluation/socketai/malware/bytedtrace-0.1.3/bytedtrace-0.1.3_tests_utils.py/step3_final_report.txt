  "purpose": "A utility context manager to temporarily override environment variables for testing or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "os.environ, function parameters (kwargs) for environment variable modifications",
  "sinks": "os.environ modifications, deletion of environment variables",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> environment variable modifications -> environment restoration",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment management code with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code saves the current environment, applies modifications based on input (setting or deleting variables), and restores the environment after the context. It uses standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code is a common utility pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for environment variable management with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its benign behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
