  "purpose": "Setup of HTTP and HTTPS test fixtures with dynamic certificate generation using trustme, including URL preparation and server threading.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (http.server, ssl, threading), trustme for certs, and pytest fixtures for server setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed into critical sinks; server setup and URL functions do not handle external input.",
  "flows": "URL construction via prepare_url, server creation, SSL wrapping, threading for server execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical testing setup for local HTTP/HTTPS servers, using standard libraries and trustme for certificate management. It does not process untrusted input into sensitive sinks, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The use of threading and SSL is standard for test environments. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
