{
  "purpose": "The code sets up HTTP servers for testing HTTP and HTTPS connections, including secure SSL/TLS configuration, and provides URL preparation for test cases.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data for server setup, imports modules such as ssl, threading, and pytest, and reads server certificate details.",
  "sinks": "Uses ssl.create_default_context() with server certificates, and starts server sockets that could potentially be manipulated if malicious certificates are supplied.",
  "flows": "Imports and initializes modules -> Configures SSL context -> Sets up HTTP server with threading -> Serves secure and insecure URLs for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. The code follows standard testing server setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for setting up HTTP and HTTPS test servers using standard Python libraries. It includes importing modules, configuring SSL contexts with generated certificates, and starting server threads. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The use of trustme for certificate handling is legitimate for testing purposes. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for testing HTTP/HTTPS servers in a controlled environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The setup leverages typical libraries for testing SSL connections, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
