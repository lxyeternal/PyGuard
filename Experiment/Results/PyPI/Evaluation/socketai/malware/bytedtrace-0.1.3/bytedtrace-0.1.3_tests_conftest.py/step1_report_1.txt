{
  "purpose": "The code sets up test fixtures for HTTP server testing, including secure HTTPS server with dynamically generated certificates, for use with pytest.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (http.server, ssl, threading, pytest, requests.compat), defines functions (prepare_url), and creates fixtures (httpbin, httpbin_secure, nosan_server).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or malicious effects; standard server setup and URL manipulation.",
  "flows": "Fixtures generate URLs and start an HTTPS server with dynamically issued certificates; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of trustme library for dynamic certificate creation is standard for testing but requires caution; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The code imports modules conditionally, which is normal for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily prepares test fixtures for HTTP servers, including a secure server with self-signed certificates issued dynamically. It uses standard libraries and practices for testing HTTPS connections and does not contain any malicious code. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of trustme is appropriate for testing environments. The code does not process untrusted input directly or pass data to sinks that could lead to security issues. Overall, it appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for testing HTTP and HTTPS servers with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly uses testing libraries and secure certificate handling for local testing, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
