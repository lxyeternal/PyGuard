  "purpose": "The code appears to be testing access to certain attributes within the 'requests' library's sub-packages.",
  "sources": "Access to 'requests.packages.urllib3', 'requests.packages.idna', and 'requests.packages.chardet' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present.",
  "flows": "The code accesses package attributes but does not process or transmit any data.",
  "anomalies": "The functions do not perform any actual actions beyond attribute access; they are simply referencing internal package components without any validation or further use. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions defined merely access specific sub-packages within the 'requests' library, likely to check for their presence or availability. There are no operations involving untrusted input, data leakage, network communication, or system modification. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior indicators are present. The code does not perform any harmful actions or attempts to hide its intentions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as simple access checks to parts of the 'requests' library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
