{
  "purpose": "The code defines three functions that access specific sub-packages within the 'requests' library to verify their presence.",
  "sources": "Attribute access to requests.packages.urllib3, requests.packages.idna, requests.packages.chardet",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or system modifications",
  "flows": "Attribute access operations without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Functions only perform attribute references; no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple functions that access sub-module attributes within 'requests'. These functions are not invoked and do not process data or perform network activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The functions serve as checks for the presence of certain sub-packages, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a dependency check with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set at 0 or 0.05, reflecting minimal risk due to attribute access. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
