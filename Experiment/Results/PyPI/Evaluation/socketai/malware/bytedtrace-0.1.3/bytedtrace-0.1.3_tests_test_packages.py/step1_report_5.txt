{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to access specific attributes within the 'requests' package's submodules (urllib3, idna, chardet).",
  "sources": "Accesses 'requests.packages.urllib3', 'requests.packages.idna', and 'requests.packages.chardet'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations; mainly attribute access.",
  "flows": "The code reads attributes from the 'requests' package's internal 'packages' namespace; no data flow to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs attribute access without further processing, no input, no output, and no side effects; lacks context or purpose. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions that access specific submodule attributes within the 'requests' library. These accesses are read operations that do not modify state or handle external input. There are no data transmissions, no processing of untrusted input, and no interaction with system resources. The functions are unused, but that alone does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to perform simple attribute access without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward attribute access without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not involve data leakage, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions are unused but do not pose security concerns.",
