{
  "purpose": "The code performs a custom installation routine that exfiltrates system information (user, hostname, current directory) to an external URL during package installation, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname() used during the run() method of CustomInstall class",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to https://0v0.in/pypi/ during installation",
  "flows": "Source functions (getpass, os, socket) collect data -> run() method executes during install -> requests.post() transmits data to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs silently during package installation without user notification or consent; external URL is suspicious; no obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that overrides run() to send system info via POST request to a suspicious URL during installation. The data includes username, current directory, and hostname. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. This behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, as it transmits user environment details without consent. The network request is embedded within the install process, making it covert. The external URL is suspicious and not associated with legitimate package repositories. The activity qualifies as covert data exfiltration, which is a serious security concern. The malware score is justified at 0.75 due to the privacy breach, and the security risk score should be at least 0.8-0.9, reflecting high concern for privacy invasion and potential malicious tracking. The code itself is not obfuscated, so obfuscation score remains 0. The overall assessment indicates high malicious intent based on behavior, warranting high security and malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains covert data exfiltration behavior during installation, representing a significant privacy and security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; however, the malware score could be slightly increased to 0.8, and the security risk score to around 0.85, to better reflect the severity of privacy invasion. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this package should be flagged as malicious due to its covert information transmission.",
