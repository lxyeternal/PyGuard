{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests library for HTTP POST, getpass for username, socket for hostname, os for current directory, setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "requests.post call to an external domain 'https://0v0.in/pypi/' transmitting system info during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code gathers user info, current directory, hostname, and sends it via POST request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The POST request to an external domain during install is unusual and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package but includes a custom install class that sends system information to a remote server. This network activity is not typical for package installation and may be used for tracking or malicious data collection. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present. The external call is hidden within the install process, raising suspicion about user privacy and security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a potentially malicious behavior by transmitting system data to an external server during installation, which could be used for tracking or other purposes. The core setup code is standard, but the custom install behavior warrants caution.",
