{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools and includes a custom install step that reports package installation details to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as username, current working directory, and hostname during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The code performs an HTTP POST request to a remote URL ('https://0v0.in/pypi/') with collected system data, potentially exposing user info.",
  "flows": "During installation, data from system info functions (getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()) flows into the POST request payload sent to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The POST request to an external, non-standard URL ('https://0v0.in/pypi/') is unusual and potentially malicious; the code does not provide user consent or transparency about data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a package with standard dependencies and metadata. The notable malicious aspect is the CustomInstall class, which overrides the run method to send system info to an external server without user knowledge or explicit consent. This action could be used for tracking or data collection. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as backdoors, malware payloads, or obfuscated code, is present. The external URL is not associated with a known safe service and raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup but includes a covert data exfiltration mechanism during installation, which is malicious. It reports system details to an external server without user awareness, representing a privacy and security risk.",
