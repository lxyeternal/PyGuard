  "conclusion": "The package contains covert data exfiltration behavior during installation, representing a significant privacy and security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; however, the malware score could be slightly increased to 0.8, and the security risk score to around 0.85, to better reflect the severity of privacy invasion. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this package should be flagged as malicious due to its covert information transmission."
