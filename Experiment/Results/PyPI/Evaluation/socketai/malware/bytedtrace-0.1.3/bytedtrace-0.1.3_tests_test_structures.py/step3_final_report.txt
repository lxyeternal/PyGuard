  "purpose": "Unit tests for 'CaseInsensitiveDict' and 'LookupDict' classes from 'requests.structures', verifying their behaviors.",
  "sources": "Static test data within test methods, class attribute assignments, and fixture setups.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Test assertions and fixture setups flow within the test functions; no external data flow or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of pytest unit tests for well-known, trusted classes with static data. It performs basic assertions on dictionary behaviors, case insensitivity, copying, and representation. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are involved. The code is clear, readable, and uses standard testing practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data flows are internal and controlled, with no untrusted inputs reaching sinks that could cause harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing known data structures, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The analysis confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
