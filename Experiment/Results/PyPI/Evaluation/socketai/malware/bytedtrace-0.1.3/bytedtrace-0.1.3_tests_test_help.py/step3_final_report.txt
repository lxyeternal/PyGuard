{
  "purpose": "The code performs unit tests on the 'requests.help' module, verifying 'info()' output, system SSL version info, and 'idna' package version handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'info()' function and package attributes, primarily via mocking.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code only performs assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from mocked package attributes into the 'info()' function's output, but no external or malicious flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The import from 'requests.help' is unconventional, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward testing code verifying package version info and SSL settings. It uses mocking to simulate different package states. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The import path is unusual but not malicious. The code is benign, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is 0, and risk is negligible. The unusual import path warrants note but does not indicate malicious activity.",
