{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be test functions for a module providing system SSL information and package version details, likely used for validation and debugging.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'requests.help' module, specifically the 'info()' function and 'idna' attribute, and also utilizes mocker.patch for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. It primarily reads data for testing assertions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves fetching information via info() and accessing 'system_ssl' and 'idna' attributes, with mocked modifications to 'idna' to test different scenarios.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The use of mocker for testing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as test functions that validate the behavior of 'info()' and package version handling. It uses mocking to simulate different package versions. No untrusted data input, network calls, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code solely performs validation and does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for verifying system SSL info and package version detection. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The logic is clear, standard for testing purposes, and contains no suspicious activity.",
