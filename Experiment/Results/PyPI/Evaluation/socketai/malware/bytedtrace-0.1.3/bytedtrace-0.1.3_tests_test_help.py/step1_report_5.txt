{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be unit tests for a module that retrieves system SSL information and package version info, specifically for the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the 'requests.help.info()' function, and mocked 'idna' package attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that handle untrusted input; the code does not process external user input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves information via 'info()' and 'requests.help', and uses mock patches to simulate different package versions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses mocking for testing different package version scenarios but does not appear to include suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of unit tests verifying the behavior of the 'info()' function, particularly regarding 'system_ssl' and 'idna' package versions. It uses mock objects to simulate different package states. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any system modifications or network communications beyond the purpose of the test framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for verifying package version retrieval and system SSL info. There is no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
