      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, which could be malicious. The behavior aligns with typical malicious tactics like stealth execution and obfuscation. While definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed without decoding the payload, the observed behavior warrants caution and further analysis. The assigned scores are consistent with the suspicious nature of the code, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further investigation confirms its safety."
