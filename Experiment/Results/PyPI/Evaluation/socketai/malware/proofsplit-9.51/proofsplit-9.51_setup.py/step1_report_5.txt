{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'proofsplit' with additional potentially malicious code for executing a PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem with os.path.exists; importing subprocess and os modules; reading environment variables indirectly; possibly reading external inputs in subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.Popen with a PowerShell command encoded in base64; potentially executing arbitrary code or commands.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of a file 'tahg', then executes a PowerShell command if the file does not exist, and proceeds to run setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that appears to execute potentially malicious payload; suppression of exceptions; running subprocess with shell=False but passing a string command; no clear documentation or reason for this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'distutils.core.setup' for packaging. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os', and checks for the existence of a file 'tahg'. If the file does not exist, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window via subprocess.Popen, which is suspicious as it can run arbitrary code silently. Exception handling is broad, suppressing all errors without logs. The setup call defines package metadata, which appears normal, but the presence of the encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of potentially malicious intent, possibly serving as a backdoor or dropper. The overall structure suggests hidden malicious activity masked within a seemingly benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally, which could perform malicious actions undetected. This indicates malicious intent and potential backdoor behavior masked as a package setup script.",
