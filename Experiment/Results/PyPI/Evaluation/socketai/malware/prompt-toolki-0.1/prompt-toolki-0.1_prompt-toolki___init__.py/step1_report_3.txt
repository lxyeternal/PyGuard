  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script performing basic operations, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present in the code; it reads no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where data could leak or cause harm are identified; the code does not output to network, files, or external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows, as the code is straightforward and does not handle untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs, are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It lacks external data handling, network operations, or unsafe practices. The simplicity suggests no hidden malicious intent or backdoors. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
