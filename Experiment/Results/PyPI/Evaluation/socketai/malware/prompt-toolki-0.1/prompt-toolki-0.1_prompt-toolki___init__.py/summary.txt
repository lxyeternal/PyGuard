  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; Report 5 exhibits behaviors warranting moderate suspicion. The current scoring is appropriate, with a recommendation to slightly increase malware and obfuscation scores for Report 5 if behaviors are confirmed. Overall, the supply chain appears secure based on these assessments."
