  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with obfuscated, conditional execution of a hidden PowerShell command communicating with a suspicious external URL. The package appears to be a vector for remote code execution or data exfiltration, warranting a malware score of 0.9, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9. It should be flagged and investigated further for potential malicious intent."
