{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for setting up a Python package named 'selfkillguipaypal' with some associated metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data via os.path.exists and potentially executes a subprocess command if a certain file does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could potentially be malicious if the content is harmful or obfuscated.",
  "flows": "If the file 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers a subprocess that runs a PowerShell encoded command, potentially leading to malicious activity; otherwise, it proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess call uses a heavily encoded PowerShell command that is hidden from plain sight, which is suspicious. The code also attempts to execute without error handling, and the setup function is wrapped in a broad except clause, suppressing errors that might indicate issues.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core and tries to import subprocess and os modules. It checks for the existence of a specific file 'tahg'. If the file does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. This command is executed with subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, suggesting an intent to run silently. The setup configuration follows, setting up a package named 'selfkillguipaypal' with various metadata, but this part appears standard. The broad try-except blocks suppress errors, which could hide malicious activities or errors in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command triggered conditionally, combined with broad exception handling that masks errors, strongly indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The code's primary malicious activity is likely embedded in the encoded PowerShell command, which could perform harmful actions. The setup portion appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the suspicious payload execution. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
