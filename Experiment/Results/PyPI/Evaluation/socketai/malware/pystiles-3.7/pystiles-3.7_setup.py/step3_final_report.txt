  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'pystiles' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package name, version, license, authors, email, description, long description URL, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, input, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; all data are static and assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, external data fetching, or obfuscated code is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or supply chain risks are detected. The email address is hardcoded but typical for package metadata. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
