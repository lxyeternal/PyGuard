  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging information for the 'pystiles' Python project.",
  "sources": "User input via setup() parameters, such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data or external data sources are used or processed in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply sets metadata for packaging without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (except email address, which is standard), or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, including authors, email, description, and package list. No dynamic code, user input, or external data processing is present. No potential data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are observed. The email address is hardcoded but appears as standard contact info. Overall, it is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It simply provides package metadata for distribution.",
