{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the packaging configuration for the 'pystiles' Python project, defining metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, such as name, version, license, authors, email, description, long_description, keywords, and package list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging and calls 'setup()' with static arguments that specify package metadata. All data used are hardcoded strings and lists, typical for setup scripts. No input handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The script is standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a normal package setup file.",
