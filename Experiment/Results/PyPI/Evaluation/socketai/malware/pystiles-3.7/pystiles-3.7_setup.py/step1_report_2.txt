  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging details for the Python project 'pystiles'.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata within the setup() function, including name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. The email address is explicitly provided but not suspicious. The code is straightforward and standard for setup.py.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static arguments to define package metadata. No external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a typical setup configuration without any suspicious elements or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
