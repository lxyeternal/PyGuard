      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious data exfiltration during installation, representing a privacy violation and potential malicious surveillance. The high security and malware scores are appropriate, though a malware score of around 0.6-0.7 better reflects the absence of destructive payloads. Overall, the behavior warrants high concern, and the reports' assessments are consistent and justified."
