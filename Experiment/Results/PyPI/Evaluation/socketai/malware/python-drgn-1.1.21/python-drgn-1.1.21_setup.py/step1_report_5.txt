  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, systeminfo; os.system call for POST request to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing curl command with JSON payload containing system info, sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Source: system info commands (os.popen outputs). Data flows into JSON payload in os.system call, which then transmits data to external Slack URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen and os.system to execute system commands and send data externally without user consent or clear purpose; collecting and transmitting sensitive system info such as hostname, user, and network configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install process with a CustomInstall class. During installation, it gathers various system information (OS details, network info, user info) using os.popen and system commands, regardless of platform. It then constructs a JSON-formatted message with this data and sends it via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The code does not sanitize or restrict this data collection, nor does it inform the user. The use of external network communication to an unknown webhook and collection of system details without explicit user consent suggest malicious or at least privacy-invasive intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, but the behavior is suspicious, especially since it leaks system info externally during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information during installation and transmitting it to an external service without user consent. It poses a significant privacy and security risk, indicative of malicious intent.",
