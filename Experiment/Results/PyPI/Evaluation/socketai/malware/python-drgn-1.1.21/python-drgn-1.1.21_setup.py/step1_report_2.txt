  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system commands via os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, systeminfo, tasklist).",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a curl POST request to a Slack webhook with collected data.",
  "flows": "System info collected via os.popen() -> data formatted into a JSON string -> sent through os.system() via curl POST to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() and os.system() to execute system commands and send data externally; no input validation; data is collected unconditionally during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional steps during package installation. It gathers system information like OS details, IP addresses, user info, and hostname through system commands. This info is then formatted into a JSON message and sent via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which might indicate data exfiltration. The script operates unconditionally during installation, potentially capturing sensitive data without user consent. The use of subprocess calls and external network communication raises security concerns, especially since it involves external servers and unvalidated data. The code does not seem to perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration that could be malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and transmits it externally without user consent, which poses security and privacy concerns. Although it does not perform destructive actions, the exfiltration of system data via a hardcoded webhook indicates potentially malicious intent or at least an unwanted privacy violation. The overall security risk is high, and the behavior warrants caution.",
