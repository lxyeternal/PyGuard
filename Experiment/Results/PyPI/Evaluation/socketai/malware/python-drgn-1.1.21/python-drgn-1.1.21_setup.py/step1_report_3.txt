  "purpose": "Custom installer that gathers system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname', and network calls via 'curl' and 'os.popen'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'os.system' to send collected data via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info collected through 'os.popen' and then formatted into a JSON payload sent via 'os.system' call to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Performs extensive system information collection during installation, which is unusual for a typical package; sends data to a Slack webhook with hardcoded URL; no authentication or encryption of data is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to execute additional system commands, collect system details, and send them to a specified Slack webhook URL. It collects OS details, network configuration, and user info, then posts this data without any user consent or validation. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential misuse for data exfiltration. No malicious payload or reverse shell behavior is present, but the data collection and transmission pattern resemble surveillance or information gathering potentially used maliciously or for monitoring without disclosure.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a surveillance tool that collects system information during package installation and reports it to an external Slack channel. While it does not contain explicit malicious payloads like data theft or reverse shells, its behavior is suspicious for an open-source package, indicating possible privacy violations and unintended data exfiltration. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to unconsented data collection and external communication.",
