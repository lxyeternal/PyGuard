{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package, gathering system information and sending it via a webhook, likely for monitoring or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "System commands executed with os.popen (uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, systeminfo, tasklist), and environment variables (sys.platform).",
  "sinks": "os.system call that posts collected data to a Slack webhook URL, sending potentially sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "System commands collect data (sources) -> data stored in variables -> os.system executes a POST request with this data (sink), transmitting sensitive info over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen and os.system to execute system commands and send data remotely; hardcoded webhook URL; collecting and transmitting system info including hostname, current directory, user info, and OS details without any user consent or authentication checks.",
  "analysis": "The script runs during package installation, executing various system commands based on platform detection. It gathers sensitive system data such as OS info, network configuration, user identity, and hostname. Instead of simply gathering info, it sends this data via an HTTP POST to a Slack webhook URL, which could be a privacy breach or used for malicious surveillance. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and data collection during installation are suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious destructive actions like file damage or malware delivery, but it leaks system information, indicating possible malicious intent or at least privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain direct malware such as system damage or backdoors but exhibits malicious privacy violation behavior by collecting and transmitting system info without user consent. The hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration suggest malicious intent or privacy invasion, representing a security risk.",
