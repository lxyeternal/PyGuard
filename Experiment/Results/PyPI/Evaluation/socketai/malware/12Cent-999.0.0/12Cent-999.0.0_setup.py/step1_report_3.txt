{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that, during installation, collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server.",
  "sources": "System information collection via os.listdir() calls, getpass.getuser() for username, socket.gethostname() for hostname.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending collected data to a remote server at 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...'.",
  "flows": "Source: system info collected via os.listdir(), getpass, socket; Flow: data sent via requests.post() to external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting directory listings from sensitive directories and exfiltrating them during package installation, which is not typical for legitimate setup scripts. The URL 'j0j0.xyz' appears suspicious, and the filename 'j0j0.poc' hints at proof-of-concept or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to perform additional actions after standard installation. It gathers system info like hostname, username, and directory listings of root, home, and SSH directories. It then attempts to create a file '/root/j0j0.poc' without handling permissions explicitly. The data is packaged into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external server. The data exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual for benign setup routines and suggests malicious intent aimed at collecting sensitive system data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation. The data collection and transmission are suspicious, and the external server URL raises concerns. This setup script is likely malicious or part of a supply chain attack intended to gather sensitive user information.",
