  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings from '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...').",
  "flows": "Gather system info (hostname, username, directory contents) -> construct payload -> POST to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Performs system reconnaissance by listing directories and creating a file in /root, which may be used for tracking or persistence. The code exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent during package install.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that runs during package installation. It collects various system details, including hostname, username, and directory listings, and creates a file '/root/j0j0.poc'. It then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP POST request. The use of socket, getpass, os, and requests modules is legitimate but malicious in context, as this behavior is hidden within the package installation process and is used for data exfiltration. No obfuscation or encryption is evident; the URL indicates malicious intent, likely for tracking or spying. This pattern resembles malicious supply chain behavior, exfiltrating potentially sensitive system information.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it silently during installation, indicating it is a backdoored package designed for covert surveillance or data theft. It should be considered malicious.",
