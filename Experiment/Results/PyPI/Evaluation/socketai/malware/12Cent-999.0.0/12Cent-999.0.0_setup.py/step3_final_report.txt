{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert system reconnaissance and exfiltration of sensitive data during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, username, current directory, and directory listings from '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'; creating a file in '/root/'; reading environment variables and system info.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/{hostname}/{username}/'.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info collection) lead to the data being sent to the external server (sink) during the run of the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "Covert data collection during package installation, creation of a file in '/root/', use of suspicious URL and filename ('j0j0.poc'), no user consent, and no legitimate purpose for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that executes during package setup, collecting hostname, username, directory listings from sensitive locations, creating a marker file in '/root/', and exfiltrating this data via an HTTP POST request to an external domain. The behavior is covert, with no user notification, and targets sensitive system information, indicating malicious intent. The URL and filename further suggest malicious activity. The code does not obfuscate its logic, and modules used are legitimate but maliciously repurposed. The exfiltration during setup is a classic supply chain attack vector. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~1, security risk ~1, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this analysis. The behavior warrants a malware score of 1, high security risk, and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during package installation. It creates a marker file and communicates with a suspicious external domain, posing a high security threat. The high malware and risk scores are justified and should be assigned accordingly.",
