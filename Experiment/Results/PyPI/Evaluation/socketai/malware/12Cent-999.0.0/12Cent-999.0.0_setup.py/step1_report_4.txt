{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script that performs an installation process, with additional behavior to collect system information and exfiltrate it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system hostname, username, and directory listings of '/', '/root/', '/home/', and '/root/.ssh/'.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/{hostname}/{username}/'.",
  "flows": "System information and directory listings (sources) are collected during the install process and sent directly to the external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code creates a file at '/root/j0j0.poc' without any apparent legitimate purpose, and exfiltrates system data to a suspicious domain. The data collection and transmission happen silently during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the setup's install command to execute additional steps during installation. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and directory listings from specific sensitive locations. It then attempts to create a file at '/root/j0j0.poc' as a side effect. Subsequently, it sends the collected data to an external URL, which is suspicious behavior indicative of data exfiltration. The request is made over HTTPS with verification enabled, but the purpose of the data collection and exfiltration strongly suggests malicious intent, especially considering the context of exfiltration and the use of a domain that appears suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information during package installation and exfiltrating it to an external server. It appears to be intentionally designed to gather data stealthily, representing a security threat in the supply chain.",
