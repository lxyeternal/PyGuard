  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and exfiltrate it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings (/, /root/, /home/, /root/.ssh/). Also attempts to create a file in /root/.poc.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/'+hostname+'/'+username+'/' with collected data, which transmits system info to external server.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory listings) is gathered, stored in 'ploads', and then sent via requests.post() to the remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Collection and exfiltration of sensitive system data during package installation, including directory listings and hostname/username info. The code creates a file in /root/ without verification. The URL used ('j0j0.xyz') is suspicious, and the data exfiltration occurs during install, which is unusual and malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools installation process by executing additional code in the CustomInstall class. It gathers system information such as hostname, username, and directory contents from common sensitive locations. It attempts to create a file in /root/ directory, indicating an effort to test permissions or plant a marker. The collected data is then sent via an HTTP POST request to an external domain, which appears malicious due to its suspicious domain and the context of data exfiltration during package install. No obfuscation is present. This pattern resembles malware that stealthily collects and transmits system data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate system information during installation. It exhibits suspicious activity by collecting sensitive data and sending it to an external server without user awareness. The code demonstrates malicious intent, making it highly risky to use.",
