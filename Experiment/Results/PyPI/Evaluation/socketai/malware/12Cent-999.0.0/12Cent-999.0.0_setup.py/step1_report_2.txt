{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information and exfiltrate it to an external server during the installation process of a Python package.",
  "sources": "Input sources include socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), and os.listdir() for various directories. Data is also gathered implicitly from system environment and filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST request to a potentially malicious domain 'https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...'. The request transmits system info which could be used for profiling or malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, directory listings) flow into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is then sent to the external server via requests.post(), representing data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs hidden data collection during package installation, writing to a file in '/root/', and exfiltrating system data without user consent. The use of an unusual domain and the naming ('j0j0.poc') suggest malicious intent. Also, the package description 'Exfiltration' is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon execution, collects hostname, username, and directory listings from critical system paths. It creates a file in '/root/' potentially as a marker or placeholder. It then sends all gathered data to a remote server 'https://j0j0.xyz', indicating data exfiltration. This behavior is clandestine, hidden within the setup process, and uses sensitive system paths and network activity. No legitimate or benign purpose is evident, and the code could be used to harvest system information maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data during package installation to an external server, with no transparency or user consent. The intent appears to be malicious, aiming to harvest system info surreptitiously. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
