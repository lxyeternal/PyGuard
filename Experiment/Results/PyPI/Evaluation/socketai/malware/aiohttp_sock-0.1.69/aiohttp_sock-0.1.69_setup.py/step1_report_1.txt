{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then download and execute potentially malicious scripts and payloads on the system.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (environ['USERPROFILE']), reading the package __init__.py to get version, reading README.md, reading embedded base64-encoded scripts and files.",
  "sinks": "Writing to system temp directories, creating files with embedded base64 content, executing VBScript file via Popen, possibly executing malicious code from embedded scripts.",
  "flows": "From environment variable and file reads (version, README.md, embedded scripts) to writing files in temp directories, then executing a VBScript file that runs further scripts and potentially malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple base64-encoded scripts and payloads that are decoded and written to disk, then executed; use of environment variables to determine temp directories; creation of multiple potentially obfuscated or encoded scripts; execution of external scripts without clear documentation; embedded code that appears to perform complex, potentially malicious actions like network communications or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs initial setup for a Python package, including extracting version info and verifying Python version. Subsequently, it creates a temp directory and writes multiple base64-encoded scripts and VBScript files. These encoded scripts decode further scripts or binaries, likely malware payloads, and write them into the filesystem. Finally, the script executes a VBScript that runs these payloads or scripts, potentially malicious. The presence of embedded, obfuscated, or encoded payloads, coupled with direct execution via shell, suggests malicious intent, such as silently installing malware, spyware, or backdoors. The code does not perform any legitimate, transparent operation but rather focuses on downloading, decoding, and executing hidden payloads, which is characteristic of supply chain or remote malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to the decoding and execution of embedded payloads, use of environment variables to determine system paths, and the silent execution of scripts and binaries. These behaviors strongly indicate malicious activity, likely to install backdoors, spyware, or other malware without user consent. The setup phase is legitimate-looking but is probably used as a cover or initial stage for malicious payload deployment.",
