  "security_risk": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It decodes and executes obfuscated payloads that can perform network operations, system modifications, or remote commands without user awareness. The use of environment variables, temp directories, and silent execution further supports malicious intent. The overall assessment aligns with a high probability of malware deployment."
