  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy client implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles network communication, authentication, and address resolution properly.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- Proper error handling.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, considering general network code)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's purpose.\n- The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The score assignments are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SOCKS proxy code, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- Proper exception handling.\n- No obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- The malware score is appropriate.\n- The confidence level (0.95) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- Uses standard protocols.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- The scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- Standard network operations.\n- No obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- The confidence level (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Proper handling of inputs and network communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns.\n- The scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is a standard proxy client with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the nature of the code as a network proxy client without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and justified. No further action or concern is necessary based on this review.",
