{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio, enabling connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket, user inputs via parameters, and address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to sockets, potentially untrusted data in request bytes, and address resolution outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed and sent via _send methods, with network responses received through _receive methods; address resolution data flows from getaddrinfo to socket connection; authentication data flows during the negotiate process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears to be a standard implementation of proxy negotiation, with no suspicious or unusual logic. No obfuscation or hidden code is present. Error handling appears standard, with exceptions for network issues and protocol errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy types and socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, handling network connection, address resolution, and authentication. It uses asyncio event loops for non-blocking IO, with proper exception handling for network errors and protocol violations. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. All functions perform expected proxy operations without any hidden or malicious intent. There are no signals of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity embedded within the code. The code’s structure and logic are consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code. It appears to be a legitimate and safe component intended for use in proxy-enabled network communications.",
