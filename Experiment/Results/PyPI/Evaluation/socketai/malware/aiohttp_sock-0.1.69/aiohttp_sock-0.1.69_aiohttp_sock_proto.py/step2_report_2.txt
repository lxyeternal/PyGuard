  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Correctly states that the code implements async SOCKS4/5 proxy classes with negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Mentions standard data flows through socket send/recv, address resolution, and credential encoding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Credentials are handled via `.encode()`, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0.2) seem reasonable, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers for asyncio.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Recognizes data flows through socket operations and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. The implementation appears standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validly states the code is a legitimate proxy client, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The assigned malware and risk scores (both 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Accurately describes the SOCKS proxy wrappers with optional authentication.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Notes data flows during connection, authentication, and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Uses standard protocols.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is sound; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Correctly states the code handles SOCKS4/5 proxy connections with negotiation and optional credentials.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Recognizes data flows during socket operations and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Uses standard asyncio and socket methods.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary & Purpose:** Properly describes the code as SOCKS proxy wrappers with standard handling.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Recognizes typical data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Focused on standard network operations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code provided is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy clients using asyncio. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Error Handling & Logic:** Proper error handling, address resolution, and negotiation procedures are present.\n- **Credentials & Data Handling:** Credentials are handled securely with `.encode()`, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is consistent with the code's transparency.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), reflecting the standard nature of the code and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1-0.2 — minimal risk, mainly due to network operations and credential handling, but nothing concerning.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard proxy code with no known vulnerabilities.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the consistent findings across all reports.",
