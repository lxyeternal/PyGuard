{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous classes for managing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections, including negotiation, authentication, and address resolution, to facilitate proxy communication in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (host, port, username, password, etc.) during initialization, network address resolution via getaddrinfo, and socket data received during proxy negotiation and address reading.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include socket send/recv methods, especially where data from the network is processed (e.g., _receive, _read_binded_address). The code also encodes user credentials during authentication if provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters into socket requests, then back from socket responses into the code (e.g., responses to authentication, address resolution, proxy responses). Specifically, inputs such as hostname, port, username/password flow into proxy negotiation requests and responses flow into address resolution and validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs standard network operations, with proper error handling and no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the encoding of username/password using .encode(), which is standard for credentials, not malicious. No suspicious or malicious data leaks or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy connection handling with asynchronous socket operations. It includes proper resolution of addresses, authentication (for SOCKS5), and reading server responses. Error handling appears appropriate for network failures and server errors. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. There is no evidence of malware, code injection, or hidden functionality. The use of socket and asyncio libraries for network communication is standard. The handling of credentials and network data is straightforward and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears legitimate and securely implemented, with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client classes with appropriate error handling and network communication. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is safe for use in normal proxy operations.",
