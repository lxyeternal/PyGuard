  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as asynchronous SOCKS proxy classes, matching the code's structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes socket data flows, including credential encoding, which is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The reasoning correctly notes the absence of obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears secure and legitimate. The low security risk score is justified given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes socket data flows, including address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. The code is standard, with proper exception handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the classes and their data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes data flows during socket operations and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The analysis notes standard protocol handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flows during proxy negotiation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the implementation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes socket data flows and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's functionality—standard proxy client code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable for proxy client code that handles credentials and network communication but does not inherently pose significant security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and appropriately score the code. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients in Python.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe and correctly assessed as such.",
