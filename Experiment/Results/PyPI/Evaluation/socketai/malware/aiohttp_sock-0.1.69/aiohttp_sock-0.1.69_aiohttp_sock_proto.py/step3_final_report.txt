{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Socket send and receive operations, address resolution via getaddrinfo, credential encoding with .encode().",
  "sinks": "Socket sendall and recv methods, untrusted data flows during negotiation and authentication, address resolution outputs.",
  "flows": "Source data (credentials, hostnames) flow through socket send operations during negotiation and authentication; address resolution feeds into request building; responses are processed to confirm connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. The code follows standard proxy client protocols without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles network communication, address resolution, and authentication properly, with appropriate error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Credentials are handled securely via encoding, and no hardcoded secrets are found. The data flows are typical for network proxy operations. The absence of suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors indicates a legitimate and safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard network operations without vulnerabilities.",
