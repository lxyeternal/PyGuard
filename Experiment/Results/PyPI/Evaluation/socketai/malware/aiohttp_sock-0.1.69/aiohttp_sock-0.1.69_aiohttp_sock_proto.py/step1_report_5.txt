{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for asynchronous network connections, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports provided to the connect methods, as well as data received from proxy servers during negotiation and response handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket send/recv operations, especially where data is sent or received during proxy negotiation and data transmission, as well as address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided host/port inputs to socket connection, through proxy negotiation steps, including address resolution, authentication, and connection commands, and finally to data transmission over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code appears to properly handle exceptions and socket operations. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code mainly manages network communication and proxy negotiation in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-structured asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers with proper error handling and no evidence of malicious activities. It does not perform any suspicious operations like data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or hidden backdoors. The functions focus on standard proxy negotiation procedures, including address resolution and authentication. No hardcoded sensitive data or insecure practices are observed. The code's design appears consistent with typical proxy client implementations, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asynchronous Python applications. It correctly handles connections, authentication, and address resolution with appropriate error handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The overall security posture appears safe based on the provided code.",
