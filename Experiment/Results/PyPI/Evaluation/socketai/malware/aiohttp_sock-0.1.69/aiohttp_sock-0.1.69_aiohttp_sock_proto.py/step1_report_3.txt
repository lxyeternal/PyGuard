{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling clients to connect through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided hostnames, ports, and optional credentials (_user_id, _username, _password), as well as data received from network sockets during negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows primarily occur when sending requests to the proxy server and receiving responses, particularly during the negotiation process, address resolution, and reading server reply data. Data is also potentially written to the socket during socket connection and data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and ports are resolved (via getaddrinfo or socket.inet_pton) before forming proxy requests; these requests are sent over the socket. Responses from the proxy are read and interpreted, which influence control flow and error handling. The code manages address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. The code handles network connections and data reception securely using asyncio; however, the use of lenient socket error handling and the potential for local DNS resolution without validation could be concerns. The code appears to be standard implementation of SOCKS proxies without obfuscation or malware-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling, including address resolution, authentication, and server response parsing. It uses standard socket and asyncio methods, with exception handling for network errors and server response validation. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or covert command and control channels. The use of well-known protocols and typical network operations aligns with standard proxy client implementations. No suspicious data flows, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no apparent malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors, and its behavior aligns with expected proxy connection procedures. No malicious signals or malware indicators are detected.",
