  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes, no data input/output or external communication.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from base exception classes. There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or runtime logic. The code is static, clear, and serves as error handling scaffolding. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes are properly defined and serve their intended purpose without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and purely structural, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. No modifications are necessary.",
