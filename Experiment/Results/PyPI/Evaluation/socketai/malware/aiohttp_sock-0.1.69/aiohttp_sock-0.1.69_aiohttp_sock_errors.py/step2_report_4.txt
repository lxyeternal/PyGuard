  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There are no data inputs, external communications, or runtime logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, straightforward setup for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n   - The conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes with no runtime or malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No evidence suggests any security risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on objective analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - The reports do not speculate beyond what the code shows.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified with the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI agree with the assessments and scores provided. No modifications are necessary. The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a clear purpose in error handling.",
