{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions with no external data dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no execution paths, as it only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of class declarations inheriting from standard exception classes, intended to model specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no operations, input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. The structure appears standard and benign. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
