  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- The code is straightforward, consisting solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for SOCKS errors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code is purely definitional, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for SOCKS and connection errors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; straightforward class definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy and general proxy errors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code is purely definitional with no security implications.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
