{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data read; exception class definitions do not involve data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no data inputs, external communications, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or potential security risks are present. The structure is simple, and the purpose appears to be to standardize error handling for SOCKS proxy operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing exception classes for specific error conditions without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. Overall, the code is safe and serves as a standard error handling setup.",
