  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, data processing, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flow, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, indicating certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all evidence points to purely definitional code with no runtime logic, no data handling, and no external communication, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0; no malicious behavior detected.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and serves as a foundational error handling mechanism.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a typical set of custom exception classes, common in Python projects for error handling. It is devoid of any malicious or suspicious behavior, and the existing reports correctly identify this. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
