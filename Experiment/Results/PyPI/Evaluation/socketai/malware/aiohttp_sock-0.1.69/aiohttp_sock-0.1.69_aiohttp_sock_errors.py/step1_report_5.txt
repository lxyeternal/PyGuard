  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only declares exception classes without any data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; the code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward class declarations inheriting from standard exception types.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for specific SOCKS proxy error scenarios and a general proxy error. All classes inherit from built-in exception types (Exception, OSError). There is no data input, output, or execution logic that could be malicious. The classes are standard practice for structured error handling in Python. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured error handling code.",
