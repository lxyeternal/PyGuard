{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions without input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception hierarchy is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception types, designed to handle specific SOCKS proxy errors and related issues. There are no dynamic operations, no input/output handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle errors in a SOCKS proxy context, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The implementation is simple, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python exception class patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger proxy or network library.",
