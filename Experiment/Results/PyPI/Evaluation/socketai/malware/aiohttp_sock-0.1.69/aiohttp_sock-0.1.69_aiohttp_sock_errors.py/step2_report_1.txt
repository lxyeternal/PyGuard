  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward set of exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors. They emphasize the absence of data input/output, malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The consistent conclusion across all reports is that the code is purely structural, serving as error handling scaffolding, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code only contains class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the code as simple exception class definitions, with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n**1. Are the exception classes correctly defined?**  \nYes. They inherit from appropriate base classes and serve the purpose of categorizing errors.\n\n**2. Is there any hidden malicious behavior?**  \nNo. The code is static, with no data handling, no network operations, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**3. Could the code be malicious despite its simplicity?**  \nUnlikely. Exception class definitions alone do not introduce security risks unless combined with other malicious code elsewhere, which is not indicated here.\n\n**4. Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**5. Are the claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \nNo. The reports correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain **0**. No security risk is present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves as error handling scaffolding for a SOCKS proxy library. No changes needed.",
