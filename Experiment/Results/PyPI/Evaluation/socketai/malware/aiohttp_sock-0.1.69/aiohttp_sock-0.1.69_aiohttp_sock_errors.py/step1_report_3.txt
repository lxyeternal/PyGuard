  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, storage, or output operations, especially untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist as the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or any runtime logic that could lead to security issues. This is purely structural code establishing exception types for use elsewhere. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for SOCKS and connection errors with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, serving as error handling scaffolding. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
