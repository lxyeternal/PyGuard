{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and supporting asynchronous connection setup.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'socks_url', 'host', 'port', 'username', 'password', and optional parameters; proxy URL parsing reads from 'raw_url'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into socket connection parameters, proxy configuration, and the actual network socket, which are used to establish network connections.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL is parsed to obtain connection parameters, then socket wrapper is created, and data flows from input parameters to socket connection and asyncio's create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Proxy URL parsing includes exception handling but no unsafe behavior. No obfuscated code present. No network exfiltration or suspicious data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection wrappers using asyncio. It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and manages network connections asynchronously. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. Exception handling is appropriate, and third-party libraries are used for proxy management without suspicious modifications. No hardcoded credentials or insecure practices identified. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate proxy connection utility with no evidence of malicious intent. It efficiently manages SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
