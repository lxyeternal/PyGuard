  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to create SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, parse proxy URLs, and establish asynchronous network connections via proxies using asyncio.",
  "sources": "URL parsing in parse_proxy_url; input parameters host, port, socks_url, username, password; socket creation in create_socket_wrapper; connection establishment in open_connection and create_connection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URLs and parameters used in parse_proxy_url and create_socket_wrapper; socket connect calls; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection using the socket.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_url, host, port, credentials) are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers, which connect to proxies and then to target hosts; data flows from user input through URL parsing and socket creation to network connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Exception handling is appropriate. No unusual data flows or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It performs URL parsing with validation, creates appropriate socket wrappers for SOCKS4/SOCKS5, and establishes connections with proper exception handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical usage and minimal inherent vulnerabilities. The code's logic is straightforward, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connection management. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
