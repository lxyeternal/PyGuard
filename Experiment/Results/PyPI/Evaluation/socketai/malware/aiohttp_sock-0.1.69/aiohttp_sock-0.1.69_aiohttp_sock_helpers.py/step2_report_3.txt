  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code provides utility functions to create SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, parse proxy URLs, and establish asynchronous network connections via proxies using asyncio.\n- It includes input validation, exception handling, and uses standard libraries (aiohttp_sock, yarl, asyncio).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions are designed for legitimate proxy connection management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code appears correct and functional for its intended purpose. No bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident from static analysis.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code does not perform any suspicious actions like data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Input validation & security**  \n  The code performs validation on host, port, and URL parsing, which is good practice.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring & Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors. It is a utility for proxy connections, which can be misused if misconfigured, but that does not constitute malware.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of **0**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Report scores range from **0.1** to **0.2**.\n- **Justification:**  \n  The main concern is potential misuse—proxy credentials, misconfiguration, or misuse—but these are inherent to proxy utilities and do not indicate an inherent security flaw or malicious intent.\n\n#### Reasonableness of Scores:\n- The assigned scores seem appropriate given the static analysis. No report suggests a higher risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Potential misuse:**  \n  While the code itself is safe, its utility could be exploited if used maliciously (e.g., hiding malicious traffic behind proxies). However, this is a typical concern with proxy utilities, not a flaw in the code.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code. The code handles URL parsing and connection setup securely.\n\n- **Consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating low risk and no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  Based on the static analysis, I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1 (acknowledging potential misuse but no inherent flaws)\n\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type          | Final Estimated Score |\n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware             | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated          | 0                      |\n| Security Risk       | 0.1                    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose. The low scores reflect minimal inherent risk, primarily related to potential misuse rather than code flaws.",
