  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of the claims, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any security risks are present.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard module setup, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, for a proxy connection library.\n- No data processing, network communication, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is consistent across reports, with high confidence levels and no malware or security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a module for proxy handling, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly describes a module initializer with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No adjustments needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same consistent assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, as the code does not perform any security-sensitive operations or data handling.\n\n**Given the analysis, I concur with the scores provided.** There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a proxy connection library, with no security issues or malicious elements.",
