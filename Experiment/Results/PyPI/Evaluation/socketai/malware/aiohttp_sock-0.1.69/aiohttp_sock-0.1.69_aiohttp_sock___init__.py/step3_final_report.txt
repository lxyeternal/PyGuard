  "purpose": "Module setup for proxy connection library, importing components and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and exports only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely import/export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module setup file that imports classes, errors, helpers, and protocol types, then defines __version__ and __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a Python package's initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer for a proxy library. It does not perform any malicious or security-sensitive operations. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
