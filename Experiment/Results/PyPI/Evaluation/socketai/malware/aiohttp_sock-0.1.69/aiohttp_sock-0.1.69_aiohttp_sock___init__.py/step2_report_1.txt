  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a module initializer (__init__.py or similar) that imports internal components and defines exports.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is consistent with standard package setup for a proxy library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is a standard module setup with imports, version declaration, and __all__ export list.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** None detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or execute untrusted code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention \"no external input\" and \"no data flow,\" which is accurate.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or hidden malicious code.\n\n### Consistency and justification:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Given the simplicity and standard structure, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is benign and poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a typical, safe module setup for a proxy library.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores and analysis are accurate. No changes are necessary.",
