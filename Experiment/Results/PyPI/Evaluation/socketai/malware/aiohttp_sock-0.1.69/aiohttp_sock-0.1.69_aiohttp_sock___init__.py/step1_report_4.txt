{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for proxy management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; no untrusted data processing or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports modules and defines exports; no data flow from sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The version string is a standard package version.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various components from local modules, likely part of a larger proxy handling library. It defines a version and an __all__ list for module exports. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or execution of untrusted code. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign module setup for a proxy-related package, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
