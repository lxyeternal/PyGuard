{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a SOCKS proxy client or server implementation, providing classes and functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing from relative modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly imports and exports classes/functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code is primarily defining and exporting components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. No dynamic execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module definition, importing specific classes and functions from internal modules, defining a version, and exposing an API via __all__. No input reading, no data processing, no potential attack vectors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy component, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
