{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for managing SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string assignment, and the __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted external input are present; the code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; this is a static configuration module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward, mainly import/export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initializer for a Python package, setting version info, importing relevant components, and defining the public API. No runtime data processing, user input, or network interactions are present. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup script for a proxy library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
