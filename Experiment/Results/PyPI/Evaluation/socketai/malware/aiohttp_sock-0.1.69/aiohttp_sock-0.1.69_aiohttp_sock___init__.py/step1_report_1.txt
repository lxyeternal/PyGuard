{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); no external input sources or data reading in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports modules, defines version and export variables, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward module import and export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components related to proxy handling, error definitions, helpers, and protocol types, then sets version and export variables. No data processing, user input, or potentially unsafe operations are present. This appears to be a standard package initialization file (likely __init__.py). No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a proxy-related Python package. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and does not pose security risks. It is a benign part of a larger package meant for proxy connection handling.",
