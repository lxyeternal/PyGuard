{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface for a SOCKS proxy connector library, exposing classes, errors, and helper functions for proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); no external data sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports and re-exports components related to proxy connection handling. It sets version info and exports public API elements. No data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The structure and content align with standard library module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It simply organizes and exposes classes and functions for use elsewhere.",
