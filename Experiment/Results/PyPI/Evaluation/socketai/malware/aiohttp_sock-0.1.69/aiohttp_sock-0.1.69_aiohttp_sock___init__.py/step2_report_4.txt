  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the purpose of the module, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module (likely __init__.py) that imports classes, error definitions, helper functions, and protocol types from internal modules.\n- It sets a version string and defines the public API via __all__.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, user inputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy package setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy client/server module.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No problems.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection library setup.\n- **Analysis:** Standard module initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy connection package setup.\n- **Analysis:** Typical __init__.py pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy interface.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, appropriate given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | **0**  |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**  |\n| Security Risk      | **0**  |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module setup with no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with this analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as they are, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
