  "conclusion": "The code embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload that executes during package installation, connecting to a malicious domain. The silent error handling and conditional execution further conceal malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and justified based on the observed behavior."
