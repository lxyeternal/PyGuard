  "is_malicious": true,
  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code pattern strongly suggests malicious intent due to heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution of an unknown payload. The high scores are justified and align with security best practices. Static analysis should flag this as a high-severity security concern, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for detailed inspection."
