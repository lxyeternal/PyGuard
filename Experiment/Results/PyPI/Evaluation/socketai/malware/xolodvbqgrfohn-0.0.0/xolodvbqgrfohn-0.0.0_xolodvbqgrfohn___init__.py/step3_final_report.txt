{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a lengthy base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using exec(), which is a common pattern for obfuscated or malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the hardcoded base64 string within the b64decode() function call.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded payload, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source is the base64-encoded string; it flows through b.b64decode() to produce decoded code, which then flows into exec() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via base64 encoding; use of exec() on an opaque, decoded payload; absence of validation or sanitization; long, encoded string that is not human-readable.",
  "analysis": "The script imports base64 as 'b', then decodes a large, obfuscated base64 string and executes it directly with exec(). This pattern is indicative of malicious intent, as it hides the payload and executes arbitrary code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are classic malware techniques used to evade static detection and conceal malicious behavior. The high suspicion is supported by the pattern's common use in malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The scores assigned (malware: 1, obfuscated: 1, securityRisk: 1) are consistent with this analysis, reflecting the high potential for harm and malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern strongly suggests malicious intent due to heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution of an unknown payload. The high scores are justified and align with security best practices. Static analysis should flag this as a high-severity security concern, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for detailed inspection.",
