  "purpose": "Decode a base64-encoded string and execute the decoded code directly.",
  "sources": "The base64 string decoded in the exec() call.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code via exec() with no validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "Base64 string → b64decode() → exec() → run decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding combined with exec() to run potentially obfuscated code. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly without decoding.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the base64 module as 'b'. It then decodes a long base64-encoded string and executes it directly via exec(). The code within the decoded string appears to be obfuscated, containing multiple layers of base64 encoding, long string literals, and complex patterns. This technique is often used to hide malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing malicious payloads. The actual code content is not visible without decoding, but the pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The reliance on decoding and executing an opaque string suggests deliberate concealment of true operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution. It likely executes malicious code or payloads that are hidden within the base64 string. The approach is consistent with tactics used in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis.",
