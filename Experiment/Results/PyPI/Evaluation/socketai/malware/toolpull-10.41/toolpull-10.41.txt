      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious intent due to the use of obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during package setup. The high obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious payloads or backdoors. The assigned scores are appropriate; further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for definitive analysis."
