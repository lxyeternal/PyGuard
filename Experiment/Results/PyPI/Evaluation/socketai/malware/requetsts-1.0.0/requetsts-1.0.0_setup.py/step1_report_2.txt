  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring installation behavior and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.name), imports from standard libraries and third-party modules ('requests', 'fernet'), decrypts code with Fernet.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code via exec(), potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "If on Windows (nt), requests and Fernet modules are imported; Fernet decrypts a token and a ciphertext, then executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet decryption followed by exec() on decrypted content; the long encrypted string and the arbitrary decrypted code suggest potential malicious activity. The code is designed to decrypt and execute hidden code at runtime, which is suspicious. The description and long_description are nonsensical strings, possibly obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then on Windows systems, performs a decryption of a ciphertext using Fernet with a hardcoded key. The decrypted output is then executed dynamically via exec(), which is highly risky as it allows arbitrary code execution. The presence of encrypted data and immediate execution indicates an attempt to hide malicious code or backdoor logic. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the conditional execution of decrypted code on Windows suggests malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with this decrypted code, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a malicious pattern: decrypts and executes hidden code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior indicates an attempt to embed malicious payloads or backdoors within a seemingly legitimate setup script. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution confirms malicious intent.",
