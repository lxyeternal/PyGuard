  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-confidence malicious activity through decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. The pattern of encrypted payloads and runtime execution strongly indicates malicious intent, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended."
