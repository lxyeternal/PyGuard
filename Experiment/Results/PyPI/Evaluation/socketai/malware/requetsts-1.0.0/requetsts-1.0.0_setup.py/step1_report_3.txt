  "purpose": "Set up script for a Python package, including a custom installation step that executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting and executing code via exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which may be malicious or maliciously obfuscated",
  "flows": "Checks os.name, conditionally imports modules, decrypts data with Fernet, executes the decrypted payload via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet decryption and exec() on decrypted data during installation, especially with obfuscated strings and encrypted payload",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via exec(). The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution at install time suggests potential malicious intent, possibly to hide malicious code or backdoors. The code does not specify what the decrypted payload does, but such patterns are common in malicious packages attempting to execute hidden code during installation. The rest of the setup appears normal, with no other suspicious dependencies or configurations. The obfuscation through encrypted strings and runtime execution is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior pattern: decrypting and executing code dynamically during installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as backdoors or system manipulation. This is highly suspicious and warrants further review of the decrypted payload to confirm intent.",
