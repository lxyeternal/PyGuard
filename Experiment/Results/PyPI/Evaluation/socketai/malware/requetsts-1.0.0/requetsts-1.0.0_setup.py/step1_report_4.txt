{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that includes conditional code execution on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements within run() method, decryption and execution of Fernet-encrypted code",
  "sinks": "exec() call on decrypted code, importing and potentially executing remote or malicious code",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests & Fernet -> decrypt Fernet key -> execute code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted code executed via exec(), use of Fernet decryption in install script, conditional execution only on Windows",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install class. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute additional code via exec(). This pattern suggests potential malicious intent, as it involves decrypting and executing code during package installation, which can be used to run arbitrary or malicious scripts without user awareness. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, further raising suspicion. The overall structure appears to conceal malicious activity by hiding code execution behind encryption and conditional logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior with encrypted code execution during installation on Windows, indicating possible malicious intent. The use of decryption and exec() suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or behaviors, making this package potentially dangerous to install.",
