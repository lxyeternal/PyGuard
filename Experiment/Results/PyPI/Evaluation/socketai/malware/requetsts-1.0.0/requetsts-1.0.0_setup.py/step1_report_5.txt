{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation process that conditionally executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info via os.name, imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code obtained from Fernet, which is potentially untrusted and can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code checks if OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code via Fernet, which could lead to arbitrary code execution during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet to decrypt and execute code dynamically; presence of encrypted data; execution only on Windows; no validation or restrictions on decrypted code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during installation on Windows, decrypts a string with Fernet and executes it. The encrypted payload could contain malicious code. The code does not validate or inspect the decrypted content. The use of exec() with decrypted data presents a significant security risk. All other parts are standard setup code, with no suspicious library usage. The presence of encrypted code suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The package executes decrypted code during installation on Windows, which could be malicious. The decrypted payload is hidden and executed dynamically, representing a high security risk. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
