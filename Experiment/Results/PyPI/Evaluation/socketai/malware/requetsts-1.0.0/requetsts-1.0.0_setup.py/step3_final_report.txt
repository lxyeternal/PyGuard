  "purpose": "Detect malicious behavior involving decryption and execution of payloads during Windows installation, indicating potential malware or backdoor activity.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, imported modules ('requests', 'fernet'), conditional code execution on Windows.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potential network activity via 'requests' (though unused), environment variables or system calls if payload interacts with system.",
  "flows": "On Windows, code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts payload with hardcoded key, then executes it via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow from decryption to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encryption key and encrypted payload, conditional execution only on Windows, nonsensical description strings, import of 'requests' without usage, and dynamic code execution via exec().",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key during installation on Windows and executes it via exec(), which is a critical security concern. The encrypted payload and key suggest obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data indicates malicious intent, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. The import of 'requests' is unused, possibly a decoy. The pattern is consistent across reports, with high confidence that this is malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-confidence malicious activity through decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. The pattern of encrypted payloads and runtime execution strongly indicates malicious intent, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended.",
