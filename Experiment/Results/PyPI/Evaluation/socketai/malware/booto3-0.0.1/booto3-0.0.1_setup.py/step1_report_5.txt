{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for research purposes, but it also includes behavior that could be used maliciously, such as collecting system process information and environment variables and sending them to an external server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), subprocess.check_output(['ps', '-elf']), subprocess.run(curl command)",
  "sinks": "curl command executing a POST request to an external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables and 'ps -elf' output are captured and formatted into data_string, which is then sent via a POST request to the specified external server",
  "anomalies": "The code actively collects system process info and environment variables and exfiltrates this data to an external domain. The comment states 'This script is for research not for doing any harmful activity,' which appears misleading given the data exfiltration behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and defines a function RunCommand that collects system process info and environment variables. It then constructs a curl command to send this data to an external URL. The RunCommand function is invoked during package installation or egg info generation through custom commands. Although the comment claims research use, the behavior of exfiltrating system data is suspicious and can be exploited maliciously. There are no apparent obfuscation techniques, and the code uses standard libraries and subprocess calls. The data exfiltration behavior is the primary concern, indicating potential malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and sends it to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. Despite the stated research purpose, this behavior resembles data exfiltration, raising security concerns. The package should be reviewed and likely avoided unless explicitly authorized.",
