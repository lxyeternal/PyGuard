{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer, collecting sensitive information such as browser data, cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, screenshots, and cryptocurrency addresses, then exfiltrating it via webhooks or file uploads. It also includes backdoor and anti-debugging mechanisms, along with persistence features.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, local state files, browser storage databases, user profile directories, process lists, and clipboard content; network requests to external servers; reading system registry and hardware info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external webhooks and transfer.sh; file uploads of stolen data; process termination commands; self-deletion and zip file creation for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, local files, and clipboard data feed into data extraction functions; sensitive data is decrypted and processed; then exfiltrated through HTTP requests or file uploads; some processes kill security-related processes and modify system files to maintain persistence or disable security features.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated regex patterns, extensive use of threading for simultaneous operations, aggressive process termination (including security tools), self-deletion routines, hardcoded webhook URLs, numerous environment variable reads, and code that attempts to disable debugging or virtualization detection. Use of anti-analysis techniques and persistence methods suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed as a comprehensive data harvesting tool, targeting browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Edge), cryptocurrency wallets, Roblox, and system info. It decrypts stored credentials, cookies, and credit card data, then uploads them via webhooks or anonymous file hosting services. It also gathers system details and screenshots. The code employs threading to perform multiple theft operations concurrently and includes mechanisms to kill security processes and disable certain security features. The presence of hardcoded URLs, obfuscated regex, and system modifications confirms malicious intent. Overall, the code is clearly intended for malicious data exfiltration and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong malicious behavior with multiple data collection vectors, system disabling tactics, and data exfiltration methods. It is clearly designed to steal sensitive user data, disable security measures, maintain persistence, and covertly exfiltrate information. It should be considered highly malicious and dangerous.",
