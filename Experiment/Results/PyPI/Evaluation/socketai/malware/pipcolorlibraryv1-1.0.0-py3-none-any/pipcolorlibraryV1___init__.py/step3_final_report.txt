{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform comprehensive malicious activities including data theft (passwords, cookies, tokens, history, credit cards), system information collection, process termination, disabling security tools, and data exfiltration via webhooks and file uploads. It also manipulates clipboard wallet addresses and searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), browser data files (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Edge), user directories, registry keys, clipboard, process list, local files, network responses, registry, and user directories.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhooks, file uploads via requests to transfer.sh and zip archives, process termination commands, file creation/deletion, process killing routines, process hiding, and data exfiltration through file uploads and network requests.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources such as browser files, environment variables, clipboard, and system info; decrypted or processed; then sent via HTTP POSTs or uploaded as ZIP archives; process termination routines are triggered based on process list; clipboard data is manipulated for wallet addresses; and collected data flows from sources to sinks through threading and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of misleading function names, extensive regex obfuscation, silent dependency installation, hardcoded suspicious URLs, aggressive process killing, extensive threading, and manipulation of system files and registry entries. The code employs obfuscation patterns and complex control flows that mask malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities including stealing browser passwords, cookies, tokens, history, credit card info, system info, and screenshots. It manipulates clipboard wallet addresses, disables security tools, kills security and debugging processes, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and anonymous uploads. It uses threading for parallel data collection, employs obfuscation techniques, and interacts with system files and registry to evade detection. The URLs used for exfiltration are suspicious, and the code installs dependencies silently, indicating malicious intent. The routines for decryption, process management, and data collection are consistent with malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer and system sabotage tool. It exfiltrates sensitive data, disables protections, and maintains persistence. The overall threat level is extremely high, and the code should be classified as malware with maximum severity.",
