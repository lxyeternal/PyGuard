{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and files, then upload and share this data via webhook and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local State files, leveldb databases, sqlite databases (Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), clipboard, process list, and files from user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, Documents.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhook URL, file uploads to external servers, clipboard modification, process termination, file creation and deletion, zip archive creation, system commands execution.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, clipboard, process info) are decrypted and collected, then stored temporarily, zipped, and sent via HTTP POST to external webhooks or file hosting services.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated or misleading function names, suspicious hardcoded URLs, aggressive process termination (kill processes like 'chrome.exe'), large scope of data theft (passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, screenshots), inclusion of potential backdoor mechanisms, and attempts to disable security features or debugging protections.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: It installs dependencies, collects sensitive data from browsers (passwords, cookies, history), extracts Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, system info, and screenshots. It decrypts encrypted data using system-specific master keys, then exfiltrates this data through Discord webhooks and file uploads. The code also searches user directories for files with specific keywords, uploads them anonymously, and kills common process names related to security or debugging tools. The code is heavily obfuscated with misleading function and variable names, suspicious URL endpoints, and extensive use of threading for parallel data collection. It also attempts to disable debugging or VM detection mechanisms, and disable or remove security-related files and processes. The presence of hardcoded URLs, aggressive process management, and data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to stealthily harvest sensitive user data, system information, and files, then exfiltrate them via external services and webhooks. It incorporates multiple techniques to evade detection, disable security, and maximize data theft. Its purpose aligns with malware activities, indicating a high security threat and malicious behavior.",
