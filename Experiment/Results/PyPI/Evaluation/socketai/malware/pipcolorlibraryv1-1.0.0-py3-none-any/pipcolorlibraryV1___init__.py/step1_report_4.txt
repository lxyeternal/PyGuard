{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract sensitive user data, such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and potentially steal user wallets and files, then exfiltrate the data via webhooks and upload to external file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (COMPUTERNAME, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browser databases, local state files), clipboard data, user input, process list, registry keys, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external webhooks and file upload services, writing to files, clipboard manipulation, process termination commands, and executing system commands like 'taskkill' and 'pip install'.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is read from browser and system databases (sources), decrypted, stored in variables, then sent over network requests or saved to files (sinks). The code continuously monitors clipboard for wallet addresses, swaps clipboard data with wallet addresses, and uploads extracted files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated or misleading comments, extensive use of system commands and registry queries for system info, persistent background threads for data stealing, inclusion of multiple potentially malicious modules (e.g., password, cookies, token theft), and the deliberate disabling of process protections and debug checks. Use of fake or placeholder variables (e.g., 'yourwebhookurl'), complex and obfuscated function structures. Code actively kills processes (like Chrome) and manipulates browser data to extract tokens and passwords. The code creates ZIP archives of user files and uploads them. It contains malicious keywords for file search and automatic wallet address replacement in clipboard.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: It extracts browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and clipboard data; it deactivates security measures and kills security-related processes; it manipulates browser databases and registry keys to steal login tokens; it searches user directories for sensitive files; it auto-replaces wallet addresses in clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses; it uploads data via webhooks and file hosters; it runs persistent background threads for data collection; it also disables certain system protections and performs environment checks to evade analysis. Overall, it functions as a comprehensive info stealer and exfiltration malware with multiple data collection vectors and obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to covertly steal a wide range of sensitive data including passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and user files, then exfiltrate via external webhooks and file hosts. It includes process termination, system info gathering, and active clipboard manipulation. Its intent is to compromise user privacy, control, and security, and it should be considered malware with very high security risk.",
