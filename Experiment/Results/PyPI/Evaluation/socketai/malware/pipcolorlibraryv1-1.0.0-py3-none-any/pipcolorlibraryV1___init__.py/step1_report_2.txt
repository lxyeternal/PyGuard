{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious activities including data theft, credential harvesting, browser data extraction, system information gathering, process termination, process monitoring, and exfiltration of stolen data via webhooks or uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, local files (browser databases, system info, user directories), clipboard data, process lists, and network responses. It also captures tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data from browsers and system states.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through HTTP requests to external URLs, uploaded to file sharing services, or posted to Discord webhooks. Files are zipped and uploaded, and data is exfiltrated via POST requests or file uploads. Clipboard data can be manipulated to replace wallet addresses and tokens.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser files, environment variables, and clipboard data feed into decryption and parsing routines that extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info. This data flows into data aggregation functions, then into network transmission functions which send data to external endpoints, webhooks, or upload services.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, a large list of process names for termination, and suspicious activity such as forcibly killing processes, modifying browser data files, extracting system info, and exfiltrating data. It also installs numerous packages without user consent, attempts to hide or disable security features, and manipulates files and processes in ways typical of malware. The code also attempts to disable or modify Discord protection, and has extensive, undocumented, obfuscated behaviors with repetitive and inconsistent patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: it installs dependencies, extracts sensitive data from browsers and system info, terminates security and monitoring processes, captures and decrypts tokens, passwords, cookies, and browsing history, and uploads or shares this data via HTTP requests to external servers. It also manipulates clipboard wallet addresses, creates zip archives of stolen data, and exfiltrates everything through webhooks or anonymous file upload services. The code includes mechanisms for process evasion, such as process checks, process termination, and VM detection. It also disables certain security protections and modifies browser files to bypass safeguards. Overall, the code’s structure and behavior clearly indicate malicious intent, aiming to compromise user data and system integrity covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is highly malicious. It functions as a comprehensive information stealer, capable of harvesting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and more, then exfiltrating all data stealthily. It also includes anti-debugging, process-killing, and security bypass techniques, consistent with malware designed for data theft, privacy invasion, and system sabotage.",
