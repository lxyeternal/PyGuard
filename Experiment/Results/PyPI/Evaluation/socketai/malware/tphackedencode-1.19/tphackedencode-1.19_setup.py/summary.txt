  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with suspicious URL and error suppression tactics. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior, indicating a high security threat. It should be treated as malicious until further payload decoding confirms otherwise."
