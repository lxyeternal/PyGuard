  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious activity through obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The setup appears benign but is overshadowed by embedded malicious behavior. Scores are appropriate, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
