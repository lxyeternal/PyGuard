{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'mcurl' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (implicitly through os.path.exists), and potentially from the subprocess call, which executes an external command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command, which could be a sink if the command is malicious. However, the command is encoded and appears obfuscated, raising suspicion.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which might be used for malicious purposes. The setup function is called normally afterward.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess when 'tahg' is missing; the command is encoded in base64, which is often used to hide malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress all exceptions, hiding potential errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core. It then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. If the file 'tahg' does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command through subprocess.Popen with hidden window style. The command is base64-encoded, which is suspicious. The setup function is then called to install the 'mcurl' package with metadata. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, making detection harder. The presence of obfuscated code and silent error suppression indicates potential malicious intent or sabotage, possibly executing malicious payloads without detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior due to the obfuscated PowerShell command execution based on a file existence check, coupled with silent error suppression. While the setup appears legitimate, the hidden command suggests malicious activity or sabotage. Caution is advised.",
