{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mcurl' Python package, including an obfuscated subprocess call that appears to execute hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command, and os.path.exists check",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command, which could potentially perform malicious actions or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "The code checks for a specific directory, then runs a hidden PowerShell command if the directory does not exist",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64, executed with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, indicating an attempt to hide activity; minimal error handling; setup function is called in a try-except block, suppressing errors",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from distutils.core, which is standard for packaging. It attempts to import subprocess and os, then conditionally runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64 if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command likely performs an external action, possibly malicious, and is hidden from typical inspection. The setup function defines package metadata. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. The encoded command warrants further analysis, but given the obfuscation and execution context, it indicates suspicious intent. No explicit malicious functions like data exfiltration are visible, but the obfuscated command's purpose is unclear, raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution intended to run hidden commands, which is suspicious. The setup configuration is standard, but the presence of encoded malicious-looking commands indicates a potential malicious or covert activity. Overall, this code exhibits signs of malicious behavior and warrants further investigation of the encoded PowerShell payload.",
