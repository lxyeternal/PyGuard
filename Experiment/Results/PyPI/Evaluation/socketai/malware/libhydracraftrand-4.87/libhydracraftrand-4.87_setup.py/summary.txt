  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup, triggered by filesystem state. The silent error handling and suspicious comments support this. The package should be considered potentially malicious, and further analysis of the encoded command is recommended. The high scores assigned are justified given the observed behavior."
