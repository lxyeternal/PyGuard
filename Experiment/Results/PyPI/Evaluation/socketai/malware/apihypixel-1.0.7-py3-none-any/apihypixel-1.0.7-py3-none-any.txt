      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert data theft by collecting system info and sensitive configuration files and sending them to a remote server. The use of base64 encoding for the URL indicates an attempt to hide the exfiltration endpoint. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified as close to 1 due to the covert exfiltration activity."
