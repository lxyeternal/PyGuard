  "purpose": "Collect system information and configuration files, then send them to a remote server via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading local configuration files (.json) from user directories; retrieving system info such as IP, username, OS; making network requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to a webhook URL; fetching a URL decoded from base64 which is used in the request.",
  "flows": "System info and configuration files are collected from local paths -> data is assembled into payload -> POST request sends data to remote URL retrieved from base64-decoded link.",
  "anomalies": "Base64 encoded URL used to fetch webhook address; access to sensitive local configuration files (accounts and launcher info); collection of IP, username, OS without clear user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system info and specific configuration files, then sends them to an external URL decoded from base64, which could be a malicious server. The use of base64 encoding for the URL obfuscates the destination, indicating potential malicious intent. Files related to game accounts are targeted, possibly for credential theft. The function get_uuid retrieves user UUIDs from a public API, which is benign by itself. Overall, the code gathers potentially sensitive data and exfiltrates it without user consent, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data exfiltration tool, collecting user system info and sensitive configuration files, then transmitting them to a remote server. The use of obfuscation for the webhook URL and targeting of gaming account files suggest malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be part of a malicious payload designed for unauthorized data collection.",
