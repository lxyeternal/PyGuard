  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login procedures to roblox.com API",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "No active data processing or data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs, as functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two stub functions with no operational code. They are placeholders for login functionality but do not perform any actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The functions' existence alone is not suspicious but indicates incomplete implementation. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal placeholder with no operational or malicious content. It does not pose any security risk or malware concern as is, but it appears to be an incomplete or template implementation.",
