{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for logging into the Roblox API using either a cookie or username/password credentials, although the actual login logic is not implemented.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' in the functions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the code, as the functions are empty and do nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs because the functions lack implementation and do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; the functions are placeholders without any logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains two function definitions intended for login purposes, but both are empty and do not perform any actions. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks. The code is incomplete, but based solely on this snippet, it does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The absence of implementation also means no malicious behaviors are currently present, though this could change once code is added.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, non-functional skeleton with no malicious activity or security risks evident in its current state. It appears to be a placeholder for future login functionality without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
