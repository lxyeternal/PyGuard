  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API interactions, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function definitions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin' with no internal logic or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling present; functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows as functions contain only 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two stub functions with no logic, network calls, or data processing. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The functions are placeholders, indicating incomplete implementation. The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores (0.8-0.9) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, and obfuscation scores are 0, reflecting straightforward code. The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.1 in some reports, but given the inert nature, they should be adjusted to 0.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete placeholder with no malicious behavior or security issues. The current scores overstate the risk slightly; they should be updated to reflect the benign state, setting malware, obfuscated, and risk scores to 0.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
