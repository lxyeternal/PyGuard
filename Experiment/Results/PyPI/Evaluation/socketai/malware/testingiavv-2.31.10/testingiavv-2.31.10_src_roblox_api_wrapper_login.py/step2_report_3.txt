  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists of placeholder functions with no implementation.\n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalous behavior are present.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Functions are empty.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified, as no actual logic exists.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Comment:** Accurate and consistent. No concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Functions are placeholders.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but justified considering the potential for future malicious code. Since the code is just placeholders, a minimal risk score is acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** The report correctly notes the code is non-functional and benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0.0 for more consistency, as no actual risk exists.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same observations as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — same reasoning as Report 2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Same as above; consider lowering securityRisk to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusions.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — justified but possibly overstated.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Same as above; could set securityRisk to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same as others.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Same as above; consider lowering risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk:** Currently at 0.1 in most reports, which seems conservative given the code's state.\n\n**Since the code is entirely placeholder functions with no implementation or suspicious patterns, the risk score should be 0.0 across all reports.** The small risk score of 0.1 overstates the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0.\n- **Security risk:** Reduce from 0.1 to 0.0 for all reports, as no actual risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the complete lack of implementation, no malicious or suspicious activity, and the placeholder nature of the code, I conclude that the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **all zero**.",
