  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login to roblox.com API",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' (input data)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present as the functions do not perform any operations",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, potential placeholder or incomplete code; no suspicious or malicious code is present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for login purposes, accepting credentials but performing no actions. No data processing, external calls, or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be incomplete or a stub. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activities, and no anomalous patterns such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, placeholder implementation with no actual logic or malicious intent. It does not pose security risks or malware threats but is incomplete for functional purposes.",
