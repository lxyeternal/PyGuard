  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox API login via cookie or username/password.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'.",
  "sinks": "None present; functions currently do not process data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for login purposes but does not implement any logic. No data is read, processed, or transmitted. There are no apparent sources or sinks. The absence of functionality indicates the code is incomplete or a placeholder. Since there is no code executing, no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of stub functions with no active logic or malicious behavior. It appears to be a template or placeholder for future development. No security issues, malware, or suspicious activity are detected.",
