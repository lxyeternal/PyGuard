  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into Roblox API using cookies or username/password, currently without implementation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'. No other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; functions are empty and do not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established as functions do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious or unusual behavior or code execution occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for login procedures but currently lack any operational code. There are no data processing, no code injection, no network calls, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The functions are placeholders, possibly intended for future development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a template or stub for login functions without any malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious activity or malware is present.",
