  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code employing eval()/exec(), environment variables, obfuscated patterns, data input points, network connections, and dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communications, file modifications, or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() or environment variables leading to execution or data exfiltration sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscation, complex control flow, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports are consistent with their scoring; Reports 1 and 5 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 2-4 lack evidence of malicious activity, with scores appropriately low. Slight adjustment for Report 2's security risk from 0.3 to 0.2 improves accuracy. Overall, scores align with evidence, with Report 5 indicating high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk; Report 5 exhibits strong indicators of malicious or suspicious behavior, warranting high scores. The scoring is justified and consistent with the analysis; minor adjustment enhances precision.",
