  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder function with no implementation (`pass` statement).\n- None of the reports identify any actual code execution, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The code is minimal and does not perform any operations, making the presence of malicious activity unlikely.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), indicating the reviewers are certain about the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the conclusion that no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no signs of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets do not contain any logic, data flows, or external calls.\n- No signs of data leaks, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The placeholder nature of the code suggests it’s incomplete or a stub, not malicious.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since all reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score is also correctly at 0, given no active security issues.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there’s no evidence of obfuscation.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The current scores are appropriate given the code’s nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores accurately reflect the findings.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a non-functional stub with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple placeholder with no active logic, malicious intent, or security issues. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment.",
