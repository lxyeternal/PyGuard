{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' passed into the 'send' function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'send' function could send data over a network or to external systems if implemented.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'send' function; however, the function body is empty (pass), so no actual data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The function contains no implementation, no data handling, or security-sensitive operations; it is a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a function with three parameters and an empty body. There are no data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The parameters are standard for a messaging function, but since the implementation is missing, no malicious or insecure behavior can be inferred. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder, possibly part of a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder with no active logic. It does not perform any operations, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Given its incomplete state, it cannot be considered malicious or risky.",
