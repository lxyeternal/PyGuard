  "purpose": "Function to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; no input or data reading occurs within the provided code",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data output, network transmission, or storage occurs within the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow since the function body is empty",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation, which might indicate incomplete code or a placeholder. No malicious activity detected within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' that takes three parameters but performs no actions. There are no data reads, no processing, no output, and no external interactions. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder. Since no logic exists, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is an empty function definition serving as a placeholder for message sending logic. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",
