{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function for sending messages between users",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (potentially untrusted inputs)",
  "sinks": "No sinks; function body is empty, no data processing or external calls",
  "flows": "No data flows; parameters are not used or transmitted",
  "anomalies": "Function is a stub with no implementation; no anomalies or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with parameters that could carry untrusted data but contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating no logic or operations. There are no data flows, external interactions, or malicious activities. The parameters are unused, and the function performs no actions. The code's minimal nature suggests it is a placeholder or incomplete implementation. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, non-functional state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no active logic, malicious intent, or security issues. The current scores accurately reflect this assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
