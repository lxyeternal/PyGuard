{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (potentially untrusted input)",
  "sinks": "None; function body is empty, no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data processing occurs within the function",
  "anomalies": "Empty function body; no actual implementation, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with parameters that could accept untrusted data but does not perform any operations. There are no data flows, no external calls, and no code execution. The absence of implementation means there are no malicious actions, backdoors, or data leaks present. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional stub with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It simply defines a function that does nothing.",
