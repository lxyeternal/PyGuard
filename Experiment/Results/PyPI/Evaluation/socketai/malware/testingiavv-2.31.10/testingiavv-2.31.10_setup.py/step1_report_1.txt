  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with setuptools and then downloads multiple zip files containing dependencies from a remote server, extracts them, and finally fetches and executes a base64-encoded package from a URL.",

  "anomalies": [
    "Repeatedly downloading zip files from a suspicious domain and extracting them",
    "Final step executes dynamically retrieved code via exec after base64 decoding, which is highly suspicious",
    "No validation or integrity checks on downloaded content",
    "Potentially malicious remote code execution via exec()",
    "No apparent legitimate reason to fetch and execute code dynamically from an external source"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard package setup using setuptools, which appears benign. However, immediately afterward it downloads multiple zip files from a suspicious domain ('frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com') and extracts their contents without validation. This behavior is typical of malicious activity involving fetching trojans, backdoors, or other payloads. The final step involves downloading a package, decoding it from base64, and executing it directly via exec(), which is an extremely high risk indicator. This pattern suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data theft, or establishing a backdoor. The code lacks any form of validation, logging, or security checks, further reinforcing suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits highly suspicious behavior, especially the dynamic execution of remote code after base64 decoding. The repeated remote downloads and extraction, combined with direct execution, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code is likely a payload or backdoor, making it dangerous to execute or include in any project.",
