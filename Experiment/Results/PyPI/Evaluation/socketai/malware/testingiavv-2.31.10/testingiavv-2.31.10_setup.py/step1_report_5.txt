{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and then downloads, extracts, and executes additional code from external URLs, likely for dependency installation or dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Reads URLs for zip files and a package URL, then downloads and extracts zip files; reads data from a remote URL for package code.",
  "sinks": "Executes code decoded from a remote URL via exec(base64.b64decode()), which can run arbitrary code, including malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Downloads zip files from external URLs → extracts contents → removes zip files → fetches package code from remote URL → decodes and executes code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of downloading multiple zip files from untrusted sources and executing remote code dynamically without validation; no checksums or validation of downloaded content; use of exec() on remote data.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard setup for a Python package but then proceeds to download multiple zip files from an untrusted domain. These zip files are extracted locally, which could contain malicious scripts or payloads. Afterward, it retrieves a package code from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it directly via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution, which can lead to remote command execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The lack of validation, verification, or sandboxing significantly increases the security risk. The pattern of dynamic code fetching and execution from untrusted sources is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits highly suspicious behavior with the dynamic fetching, extraction, and execution of code from external, untrusted sources. The use of exec() on remote code represents a critical security risk, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
