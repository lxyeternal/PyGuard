{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package setup and then downloads, extracts, and executes several external zip files and a base64-encoded package from a remote server.",
  "sources": "Input sources include remote URLs (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getcrypto, getpsutil, geturllib3, getcharset, getidna, getcertifi, getrequests, getpackage) from which files and data are retrieved.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include extraction of zip files into the local environment and execution of code via exec(base64.b64decode(package_name)), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from remote URLs (sources) into zip files and a base64-encoded package; extracted zip files are placed into the local filesystem; finally, the decoded base64 data is executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads multiple zip files from an untrusted external source and immediately extracts and executes code from the final payload without validation or verification. The use of 'exec' on decoded base64 data is highly suspicious and a common vector for executing malicious code. The repeated download and extraction pattern is unusual and indicative of potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script first performs a standard package setup using setuptools, which appears benign. However, it then proceeds to download multiple zip files from a suspicious domain ('frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com'), extracting their contents into the environment, which could include malicious code. The final step downloads a package as raw data and executes it after decoding from base64, which is a significant security risk as it allows execution of arbitrary and potentially harmful code. No validation, signature check, or sandboxing is performed on the downloaded payloads, and the reliance on external sources without verification indicates malicious intent or supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior, including downloading, extracting, and executing code from untrusted sources, and executing arbitrary code via base64 decoding and eval. This pattern strongly suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector. It should be considered dangerous and not used in production environments.",
