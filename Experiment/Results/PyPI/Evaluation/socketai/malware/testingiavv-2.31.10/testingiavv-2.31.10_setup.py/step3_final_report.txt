{
  "purpose": "The code downloads multiple zip files from a suspicious domain, extracts them without validation, then fetches a package, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "URLs fetching zip files and the package; reading from remote URLs and the final package URL.",
  "sinks": "exec(base64.b64decode(package_name)) — executing remote code; extraction of zip files without validation.",
  "flows": "Download zip files -> extract -> fetch package -> decode base64 -> execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated downloads from a suspicious domain; executing remote code without validation; lack of integrity checks; multiple similar fetch-extract patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple remote downloads of zip files and a package, extracts them without validation, then decodes and executes code fetched from a remote URL via exec(). This pattern indicates active remote code execution, a common malicious tactic. The code lacks validation, integrity checks, or sandboxing, increasing risk. The use of exec() on untrusted data is highly dangerous, potentially leading to backdoors, data theft, or system compromise. The code is straightforward but exhibits behaviors typical of supply chain attacks or malware payloads. The repeated pattern and lack of validation confirm malicious intent. The malware score is set to 1, reflecting the high likelihood of malicious activity, and the security risk score is also 1, indicating an extremely dangerous pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior through remote code fetching, extraction, and execution without validation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, posing a severe security threat.",
