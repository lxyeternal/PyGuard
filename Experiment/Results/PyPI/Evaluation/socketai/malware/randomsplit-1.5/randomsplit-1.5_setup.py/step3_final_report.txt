  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior or sabotage in the Python package, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call executing an encoded PowerShell command when 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the obfuscated PowerShell command, which could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor establishment.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, it runs the encoded PowerShell command silently, with errors suppressed, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently with suppressed errors; broad try-except blocks conceal failures; obfuscation of payload.",
  "analysis": "The code executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess when 'tahg' does not exist, with silent error handling and no validation. This pattern is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor setup. The package setup code appears benign, but the embedded command raises suspicion. The obfuscation and concealment tactics justify high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.8) scores. The silent execution and broad exception handling further increase concern. Without decoding the payload, certainty is limited, but the behavior aligns with supply chain attack indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation and concealment tactics justify elevated malware and risk scores. It should be flagged for further analysis and caution in deployment.",
