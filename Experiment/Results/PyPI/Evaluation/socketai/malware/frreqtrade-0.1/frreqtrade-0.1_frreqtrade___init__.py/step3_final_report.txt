  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, dynamic imports, network/system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources (input, environment) to sinks (network, system) via dynamic execution and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, variable concealment, unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic features, with data flowing from environment or input to network/system sinks. No explicit malicious payloads are identified, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest potential concealment. The suspicion is moderate, with scores reflecting cautious concern. Benign code shows no anomalies. The suspicious features justify a malware score around 0.2-0.4 and a security risk of 0.4-0.5, consistent with the level of obfuscation and dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate, indicating moderate suspicion where obfuscation is present, but overall benign behavior in other cases. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets before deployment.",
