  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate, indicating moderate suspicion where obfuscation is present, but overall benign behavior in other cases. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets before deployment."
