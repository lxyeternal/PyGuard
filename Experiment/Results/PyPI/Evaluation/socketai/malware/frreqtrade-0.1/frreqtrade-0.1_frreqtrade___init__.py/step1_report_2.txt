  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational task, likely related to data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to the lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables initialized within the script and possibly from external modules or environment variables if used, but no explicit external input or data sources are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious intent; data appears to be processed internally within functions without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code structure is straightforward without suspicious dynamic execution or complex obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks external input handling, malicious data processing, or suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with standard Python constructs. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present upon detailed review.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. It seems to be a normal, non-malicious script with no suspicious activities or security concerns.",
