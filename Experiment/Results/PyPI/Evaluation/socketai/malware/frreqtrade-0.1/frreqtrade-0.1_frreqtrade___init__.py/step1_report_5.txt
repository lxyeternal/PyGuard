  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to data processing or system utility functions, but no explicit functionality is discernible due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly files or network sources (if present), but specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or system commands, but these are not clearly identifiable without explicit code segments.",
  "flows": "There are no clearly defined source-to-sink data flows in the provided code snippet, as the code appears minimal and lacks detailed operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation techniques are evident. No backdoors, secret credentials, or malicious constructs are detected in the visible code.",
  "analysis": "The review of the code reveals minimal content, limited to standard library imports and simple function definitions. No dangerous or malicious behavior is observable. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears legitimate. Without additional context or code sections, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and standard. The confidence level is high due to the minimal and straightforward nature of the code.",
