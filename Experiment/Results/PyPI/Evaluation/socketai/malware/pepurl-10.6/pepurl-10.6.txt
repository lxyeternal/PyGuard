      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior characteristic of malware, including obfuscated, silently executed payloads triggered conditionally during setup. The broad error suppression and background execution further increase suspicion. Scores assigned are appropriate; further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Until then, treat this package as highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
