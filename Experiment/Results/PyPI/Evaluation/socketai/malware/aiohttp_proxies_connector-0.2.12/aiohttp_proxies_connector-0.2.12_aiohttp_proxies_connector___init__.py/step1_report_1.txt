{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for implementing SOCKS proxy connections, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); potential data inputs come from the functions and classes used elsewhere in the package, not directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Calls to functions like open_connection, create_connection; potential data sinks depend on their implementation, which are not shown here.",
  "flows": "The code structure indicates initial setup and export of classes, functions, and constants; no data flow or untrusted input handling is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. No network activity, data manipulation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily import statements, version declaration, and an explicit __all__ list for exports. It serves as an interface or module definition, not executing any logic that handles input/output or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious backdoors, or security issues are visible in this snippet. The code relies on other modules for core functionality, which are not provided here. Based on this limited code, it appears to be a benign component of a proxy library.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward module setup for a proxy-related package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports functions, classes, and constants for use elsewhere. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent.",
