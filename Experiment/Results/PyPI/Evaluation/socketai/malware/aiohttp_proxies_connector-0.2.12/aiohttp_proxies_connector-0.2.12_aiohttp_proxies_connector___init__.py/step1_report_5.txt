{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an interface for a SOCKS proxy client, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type enumeration.",
  "sources": "import statements from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no functions executing untrusted data, network connections, or command execution within this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets up imports, definitions, and exports, without runtime logic or data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version declaration, and __all__ exports, standard in a package's __init__.py or module setup. There are no active data flows, no untrusted data sources, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. All imported modules are internal, and the code only exposes a set of classes and functions for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities evident in this snippet.",
