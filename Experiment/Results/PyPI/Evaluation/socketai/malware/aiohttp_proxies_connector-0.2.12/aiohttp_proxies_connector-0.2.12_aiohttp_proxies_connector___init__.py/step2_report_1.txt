  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the described purpose, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n\n- It contains only import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string.\n- Sets an `__all__` list to specify exported symbols.\n- No functions, logic, data processing, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy package setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, mainly module setup.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, given no active logic or vulnerabilities.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, proxy handling library setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Zero risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy module initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no issues.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy client/library setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for SOCKS proxy.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Accurate assessment.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely setup/initialization, with no active logic or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score is consistently zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is zero, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are minimal or zero, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No. The code is just module setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain very low, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but a slight default risk score for module exposure is acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code snippet is benign, serving as a module interface for a SOCKS proxy library. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal.",
