  "purpose": "Module setup and interface for SOCKS proxy handling, exposing classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data processing within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports and exposes symbols; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module initialization file, importing internal components and defining an API via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or malicious patterns indicate a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify this as a standard setup module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
