{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy handling library, providing classes, error definitions, and helper functions for establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; no output or external communication functions",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow paths; mainly importing and defining public API",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports components from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no functions that process untrusted input, nor any code that communicates externally or manipulates data in a way that could be malicious. The code is straightforward, serving as an API interface. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that exports classes, error types, and helpers related to proxy connections. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external communication, and no obfuscated elements. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
