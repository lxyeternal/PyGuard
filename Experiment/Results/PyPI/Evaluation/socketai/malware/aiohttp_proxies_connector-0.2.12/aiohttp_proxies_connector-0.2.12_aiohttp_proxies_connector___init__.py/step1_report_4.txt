{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client or library, providing connectors, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected; code is straightforward and appears to be part of a standard package setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to SOCKS proxy handling and then exposes them via __all__, with a version string. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, nor any other suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module initialization file. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code functions primarily as a module interface, defining what components are available for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package related to proxy handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use.",
