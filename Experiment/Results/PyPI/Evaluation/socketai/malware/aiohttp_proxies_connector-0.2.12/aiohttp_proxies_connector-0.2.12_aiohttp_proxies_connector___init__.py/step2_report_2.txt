  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe this code as a module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, mainly consisting of import statements, version declaration, and an __all__ list for exports.\n- They uniformly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: setting up a public API for proxy handling components.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code content:** The code is straightforward, importing internal modules and exposing classes/functions/constants via `__all__`. No data processing, network activity, or input handling is present.\n- **Malicious indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or dynamic code execution are visible.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Since the code only exposes interfaces and constants, and relies on other modules (not provided), there is no evident vulnerability here.\n- **Malware presence:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, matching the clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Are any adjustments needed?\n\n- Given the evidence, the current scores seem accurate and reasonable.\n- The high confidence scores are justified based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal setup nature)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard module initialization for a proxy library, with no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated logic. The high confidence and zero malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 for absolute certainty)\n\n**Note:** If you prefer a more conservative approach, setting risk to 0 is also justified, but 0.1 remains reasonable given the module's role as a benign interface setup.",
