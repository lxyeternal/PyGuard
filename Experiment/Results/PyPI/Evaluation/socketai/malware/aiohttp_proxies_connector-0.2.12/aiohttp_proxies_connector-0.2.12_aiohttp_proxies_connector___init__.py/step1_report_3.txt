{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package for handling proxy connections, including importing modules, defining version information, and exposing public API elements.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or interact with external data sources directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The version string is static. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific components from local modules and sets up the module's public API with __all__. The version is statically assigned. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or data processing that could be exploited or manipulated. All elements seem to serve straightforward module initialization purposes without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file for a Python package related to proxy handling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not exhibit any signs of obfuscation or malware.",
