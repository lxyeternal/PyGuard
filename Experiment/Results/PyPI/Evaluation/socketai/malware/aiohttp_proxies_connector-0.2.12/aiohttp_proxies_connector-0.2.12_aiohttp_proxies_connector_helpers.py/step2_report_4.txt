  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for creating and establishing network connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.\n- Parses proxy URLs, manages socket wrappers, and establishes connections asynchronously.\n- Uses external libraries (e.g., yarl, aiohttp_proxies_connector) for URL parsing and proxy handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- Focused on standard proxy connection setup with proper validation and error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code correctly parses proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages asynchronous connections. No issues with the logic or implementation are apparent.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors:**  \n  The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. It relies on external libraries for proxy handling, which are standard.\n\n- **Handling of untrusted input:**  \n  Proxy URLs are parsed with exception handling, and credentials are extracted from URLs. While untrusted proxy URLs could lead to misconfigurations, this is expected in proxy scenarios, not malicious.\n\n- **Data exfiltration or backdoors:**  \n  No evidence of such behaviors. The code merely establishes network connections; it does not process or transmit data beyond connection setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5 common points:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and handles proxy connections properly.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems conservative but acceptable given the code's purpose.\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Any anomalies or concerns?**  \n- No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no backdoors, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The only potential concern is misuse if proxy URLs are untrusted, but that’s inherent to proxy configuration, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:**  \n  **No.** The code is purely utility for proxy connection management.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  **No.** Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  **0.** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  **0.2** seems reasonable, considering it handles network connections and proxy credentials, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, though it could be slightly lower given the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections in Python. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the handling of untrusted proxy URLs, which is typical in such utilities.\n\n**Final estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2             |\n\n**Note:** The current scores in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with them based on the detailed analysis.",
