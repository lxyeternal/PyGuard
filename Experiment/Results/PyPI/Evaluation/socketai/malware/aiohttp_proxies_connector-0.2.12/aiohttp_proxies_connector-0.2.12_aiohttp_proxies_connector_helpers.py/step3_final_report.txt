  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating and establishing network connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, including URL parsing, socket creation, and asynchronous connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, function parameters (host, port, proxy URL), environment variables (via asyncio.get_event_loop()), external libraries for proxy handling.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection, sock.connect() — establishing network connections through proxies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and proxy URLs are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers which connect to proxies, ultimately leading to network connections to target hosts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Proper validation and exception handling are present. No malicious data flows or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for SOCKS proxy connection handling in Python. It correctly parses proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages asynchronous connections. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External dependencies are standard and trustworthy. The security risk score of approximately 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting potential misuse if untrusted proxy URLs are supplied, but this is inherent to proxy configuration, not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
