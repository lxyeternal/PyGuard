{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) to enable proxy connections in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input for hostnames, ports, optional credentials, and internal method calls to resolve addresses and send/receive data over sockets.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network sockets, performs DNS resolution, and communicates with proxy servers. Receives data from network sockets.",
  "flows": "User input (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and socket connection methods; then data is sent/received over the socket connection to the proxy server; responses from proxy determine further actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network domains or URLs; no code that appears to exfiltrate data or establish backdoors. Error handling is standard. No dynamic execution or insecure eval is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications, allowing connections through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with optional authentication. It handles address resolution, connection establishment, and error reporting in a typical manner. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as covert data exfiltration, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The functions are clearly structured for legitimate proxy connection purposes. The code does not contain obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or insecure practices beyond typical socket operations, which are necessary for proxy functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asyncio, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles proxy negotiations and socket operations without any malicious signals.",
