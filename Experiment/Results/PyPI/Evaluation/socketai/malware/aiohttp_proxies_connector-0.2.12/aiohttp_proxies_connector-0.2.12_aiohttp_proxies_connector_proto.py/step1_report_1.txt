{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing clients to connect through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as host, port, username, password, and address resolution results. Data is read from the network via sock_recv and socket connection attempts.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions, especially _send, _receive, sock_sendall, sock_recv, and socket.connect. These can be used to transmit data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are used to construct connection requests; data is sent via _send; responses are received via _receive; connection is established and negotiated through the proxy protocols.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for proxy negotiation, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network behavior. There is proper exception handling; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio for asynchronous network operations. It handles address resolution, protocol negotiation, and optional authentication. All network operations are confined to standard socket and asyncio functions, with proper error handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are present. The structure and variable usage are consistent and clear. No evidence of malicious intent or data exfiltration methods. The code’s purpose is to facilitate proxy connections in a legitimate manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal proxy connection purposes.",
