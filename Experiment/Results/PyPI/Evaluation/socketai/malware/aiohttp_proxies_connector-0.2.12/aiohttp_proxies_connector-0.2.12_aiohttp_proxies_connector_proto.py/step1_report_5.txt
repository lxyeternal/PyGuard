{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for establishing network connections via a proxy server, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and input addresses. Resolving hostnames via getaddrinfo. Receiving data from proxy server responses.",
  "sinks": "Sending constructed request data over sockets. Receiving data that includes address information and proxy server responses. Connecting to external proxy hosts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are used to construct proxy connection requests, sent via socket, with responses parsed for success/failure. Resolved addresses flow from DNS resolution to request construction, then socket communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated or overly complex code segments. No suspicious network behaviors such as data exfiltration, command-and-control communications, or backdoors are evident. Use of standard libraries and straightforward socket communication. Error handling is typical for network protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation for SOCKS proxy client wrappers, handling connection establishment, authentication, and address resolution. It utilizes common async patterns with asyncio and socket, with error handling aligned with expected protocol behavior. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert data leaks are identified. The code strictly performs proxy negotiation and connection setup without any data exfiltration, remote command execution, or unauthorized system modifications. The functions and classes appear to serve their intended purpose for proxy communications with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard network protocol interactions without any malicious behaviors or hidden backdoors. The structure is straightforward, using common libraries and patterns, with no suspicious anomalies.",
