{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connections through these proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports for target and proxy servers, user credentials for authentication, and network responses received via socket communication.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket send/recv functions that transmit or receive data over the network, especially untrusted data such as proxy responses or user credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (host, port, credentials) through address resolution, proxy negotiation (including authentication), and ultimately to the socket connection establishment and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard with typical implementation of SOCKS protocols. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior is evident. The code properly manages socket connections and authentication flows without suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It uses asyncio for asynchronous operations and manages socket connections securely, including error handling. No suspicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden network communication, are present. The code relies on well-understood socket and asyncio APIs. The logic flow follows standard proxy protocols without deviations that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to implement legitimate SOCKS proxy client functionality without malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles network connections securely and correctly, with appropriate error handling and protocol adherence. No signs of malware or malicious activity are detected.",
