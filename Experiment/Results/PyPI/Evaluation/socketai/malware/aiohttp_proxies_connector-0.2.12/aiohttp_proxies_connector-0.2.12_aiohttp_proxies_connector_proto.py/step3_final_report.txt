{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous Python applications, enabling connection through proxy servers with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from network sockets during negotiation and data transfer; it resolves hostnames via getaddrinfo; it reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include network responses during negotiation (e.g., server reply codes), address resolution responses, and user-supplied credentials during authentication.",
  "flows": "Sources include hostname resolution and user credentials; flows lead to sending requests via _send(), receiving server responses via _receive(), and establishing connections; data flows from input parameters to network communication, with validation checks on server responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity; code structure is standard for proxy clients; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It performs hostname resolution, constructs protocol-specific request packets, handles authentication, and manages network connections with proper error handling. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code adheres to expected proxy client behavior, with clear separation of concerns and proper validation of server responses. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected, and the logic aligns with typical proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It performs expected functions securely and transparently, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious intent.",
