{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous connections through a proxy server with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket streams (sock_recv), address resolution functions, and user-supplied hostnames and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to socket streams (sock_sendall), potentially sending credentials, proxy requests, and hostname data.",
  "flows": "Hostnames and user credentials (if any) are processed, then combined into proxy protocol requests sent via socket, with responses read back from the socket stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code performs standard SOCKS proxy negotiation. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No network connections to suspicious domains or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client functionality, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with optional username/password authentication. It uses asynchronous socket operations, resolves hostnames via DNS or locally, and manages connection and negotiation processes securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code handles exceptions appropriately, and there are no suspicious or unusual code constructs. It appears to be a legitimate network utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functionality for proxy connection and negotiation. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
