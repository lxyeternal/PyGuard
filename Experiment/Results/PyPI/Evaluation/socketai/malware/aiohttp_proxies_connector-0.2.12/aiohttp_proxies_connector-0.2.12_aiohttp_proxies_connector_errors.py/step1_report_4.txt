{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol and proxy errors to handle various error conditions in network communication.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; all classes are solely exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; classes do not perform any I/O or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; classes are purely structural definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; exception classes are standard and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exception handling related to SOCKS protocol errors and general proxy errors. These classes inherit from base exception classes and do not contain any methods, data, or logic. There are no data inputs, external calls, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes for network error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for use as part of a larger network application.",
