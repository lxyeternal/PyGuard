  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors for use in error handling within a network application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; exception classes do not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation occurs in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All classes are straightforward custom exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a set of custom exception classes for handling specific SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors. No input, no data processing, no network operations, and no suspicious logic are present. The classes inherit from base exception classes, and there are no dynamic behaviors, obfuscated elements, or hidden code. The structure appears to be for error handling within a larger network application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign setup for managing SOCKS proxy-related errors.",
