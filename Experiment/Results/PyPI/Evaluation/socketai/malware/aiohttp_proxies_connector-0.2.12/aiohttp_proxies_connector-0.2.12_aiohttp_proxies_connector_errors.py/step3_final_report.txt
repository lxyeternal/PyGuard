{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures, serving as error handling components in a network proxy application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes; no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions; purely structural class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving external sources or sinks; static class inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports and scores accurately reflect this, requiring no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
