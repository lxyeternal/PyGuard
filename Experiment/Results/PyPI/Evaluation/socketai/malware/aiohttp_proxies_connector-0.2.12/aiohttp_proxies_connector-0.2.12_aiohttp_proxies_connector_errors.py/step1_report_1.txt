  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all exception classes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output, or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of exception class definitions with no executable or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares several custom exception classes for handling SOCKS and proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception types. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase that would use these exceptions for error handling, but by itself, it is benign and standard for Python error management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger application or library, purely defining error types.",
