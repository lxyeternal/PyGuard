  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No issues with the logic, reasoning, or summary in the reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential points of critique or considerations:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: defining exception classes for SOCKS and proxy error handling.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No suspicious claims or assumptions are made in the reports; they are purely descriptive.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is implied or detected.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n- No further action or score adjustments are needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
