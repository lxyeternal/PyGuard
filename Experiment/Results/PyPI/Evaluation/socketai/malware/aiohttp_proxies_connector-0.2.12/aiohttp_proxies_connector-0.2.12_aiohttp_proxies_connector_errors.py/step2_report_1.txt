  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, purely structural, and lacks any malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, and the code is purely exception class definitions, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - This is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based solely on static code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nGiven the static, benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the provided assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard, harmless, and serves as a set of custom exception definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
