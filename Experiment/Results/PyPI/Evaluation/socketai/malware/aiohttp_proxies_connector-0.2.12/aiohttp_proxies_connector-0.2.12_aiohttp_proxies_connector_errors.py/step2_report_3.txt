  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The reports correctly identify that these are static class definitions with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n\n2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n3. Review the scores assigned:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code content.\n\n4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The risk scores are 0, which is justified because the code is purely definitional and contains no operational or malicious logic.\n- No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. Address malware scores:\n- All reports assign malware scores as 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they only describe the code as benign exception class definitions.\n- No assumptions need to be challenged.\n\n7. Check score consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard error handling class definitions. The reports correctly reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
