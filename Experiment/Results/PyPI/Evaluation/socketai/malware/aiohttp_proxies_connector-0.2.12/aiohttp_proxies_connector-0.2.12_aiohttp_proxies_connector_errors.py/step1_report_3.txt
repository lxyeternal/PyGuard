  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within the code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions used for error handling in SOCKS proxy and connection contexts. There are no data inputs, outputs, or operations that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. It poses no security risks or malware threats. It is standard and benign.",
