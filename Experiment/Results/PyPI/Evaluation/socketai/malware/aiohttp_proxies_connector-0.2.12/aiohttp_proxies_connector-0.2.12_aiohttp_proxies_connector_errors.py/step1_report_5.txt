{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions with exception inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code consists solely of class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes several custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and authentication errors, inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no data inputs, no functions, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The structure is straightforward, purely defining exception classes without any operational or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling related to SOCKS proxies. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks present.",
