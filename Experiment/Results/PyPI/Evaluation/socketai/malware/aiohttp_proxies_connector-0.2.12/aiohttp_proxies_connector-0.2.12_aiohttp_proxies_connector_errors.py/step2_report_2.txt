  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and purely structural.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed; scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude that the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0, since there's no malware or malicious intent present.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or code execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable facts—no assumptions about hidden behavior.\n   - They correctly state that this code is part of a larger application but by itself, it is harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary & Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (benign, standard exception class definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores or analysis. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
