  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines several custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors. All classes inherit from standard Python exception classes, and there are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code is purely class definitions with no executable or malicious logic.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, correctly structured, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose & Analysis:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines exception classes, with no data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Anomalies & Suspicious Patterns:**  \n  None. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:**  \n  All conclude the code is benign, with a confidence of 1. This is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is standard for error handling in network applications involving SOCKS proxies.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower (since no actual risk is identified, a 0 is appropriate)\n\n**Note:** A risk score higher than 0.5 would imply some potential security concern, which is not supported here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
