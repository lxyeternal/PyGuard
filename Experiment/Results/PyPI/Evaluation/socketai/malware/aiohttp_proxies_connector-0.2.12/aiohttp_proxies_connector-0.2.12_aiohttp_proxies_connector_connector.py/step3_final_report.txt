  "purpose": "Implement a proxy connector for aiohttp supporting HTTP and non-HTTP proxies with dynamic URL construction and socket management.",
  "sources": "User-provided proxy parameters, external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url`",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL formation, socket connection initiation",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> proxy_url property -> socket creation -> connection setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard dynamic URL handling from user input",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a proxy connector, constructing proxy URLs from user input, creating sockets (including custom socket wrappers), and managing connections. External functions are used but not provided; their benign nature is assumed. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, which is typical for proxy configuration code. The low risk score reflects potential misconfiguration risks but no active malicious behavior. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or data exfiltration. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious intent or behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores correctly indicate no issues. No modifications are necessary.",
