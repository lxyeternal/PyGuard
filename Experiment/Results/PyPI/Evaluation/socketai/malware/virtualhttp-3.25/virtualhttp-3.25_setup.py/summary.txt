  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command during setup. The behavior suggests potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms. The overall security risk is high, and further analysis (decoding the payload) is strongly recommended."
