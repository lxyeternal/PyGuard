  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, with scores reflecting significant security concern. Decoding the command is recommended for confirmation, but current analysis justifies high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores."
