      "conclusion": "The script contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, which could lead to system compromise. The evidence supports high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended, but current analysis warrants caution and treating the package as malicious."
