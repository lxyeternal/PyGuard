{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality for colored terminal output, including color styling, environment detection, and Windows terminal mode enabling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), checks terminal TTY status via sys.stdout.isatty(), and platform detection.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence color enablement; platform and terminal type determine behavior; color attributes are generated based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code performs standard terminal styling operations without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles terminal color styling by mapping color names and hex values to ANSI escape codes, detects terminal capabilities, and manages Windows console mode enabling. It reads environment variables to override color support, performs platform-specific Windows mode adjustments via ctypes, and provides utility functions for styling text. There are no suspicious network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The code adheres to typical terminal styling patterns and environment checks. No obfuscated code or malicious code paths are identified. Overall, the code appears to be a benign terminal styling utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility with environment-aware color support and Windows compatibility features. No malicious or suspicious behavior was detected. The script is safe and does not pose security risks.",
