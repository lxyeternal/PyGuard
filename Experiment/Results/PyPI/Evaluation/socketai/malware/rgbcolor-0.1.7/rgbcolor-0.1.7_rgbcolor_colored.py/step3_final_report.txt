  "purpose": "A terminal styling utility that manages ANSI escape sequences, platform-specific Windows console configuration, and environment variable-based enable/disable logic for color output.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), checks system info (platform.system()), and inspects sys.stdout and sys.stderr for TTY status.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily outputs ANSI escape sequences for styling.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system checks influence whether ANSI codes are emitted; no external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of local HEX class appears benign. Minor exception handling around environment variables could be improved.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling module that enables ANSI escape sequences, handles Windows console mode via ctypes, and respects environment variables for color support. It does not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration activities. The Windows API calls are standard for enabling virtual terminal processing. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The environment variable checks are typical for such utilities, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured terminal styling utility with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The environment variable and platform-specific API usage are standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no actual security concern.",
