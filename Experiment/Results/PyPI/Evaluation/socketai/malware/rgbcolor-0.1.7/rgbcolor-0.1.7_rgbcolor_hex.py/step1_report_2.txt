  "purpose": "Define a mapping between xterm color codes and their hexadecimal representations, and provide functions to convert between them.",
  "sources": "The color dictionary '_xterm_colors', input parameters 'color' in HEX function.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "HEX function converts input HEX to xterm color code via exact match or nearest match, with no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious dynamic execution or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a color mapping dictionary and functions to convert HEX color codes to xterm color indices. It performs color matching by exact lookup and least squares fitting for nearest color. There are no external inputs, outputs, or network calls. The functions operate purely on provided data without side effects. No signs of malicious or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for color conversions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or potentially harmful actions.",
