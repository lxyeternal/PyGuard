  "purpose": "Provides a utility to convert HEX color codes to xterm color indices, supporting exact and nearest color matching.",
  "sources": "Reads input HEX color string from the 'color' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Returns the corresponding xterm color index as a string.",
  "flows": "Input HEX color -> color extension if shorthand -> exact match lookup -> if no match, compute nearest color via RGB least squares -> output color index.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and performs standard color matching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive color map and a function HEX() that extends shorthand HEX colors, attempts exact matching in the color map, and if no match is found, calculates the nearest color based on RGB Euclidean distance. The logic is simple, transparent, and does not involve external data, network, or file I/O. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward color conversion utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
