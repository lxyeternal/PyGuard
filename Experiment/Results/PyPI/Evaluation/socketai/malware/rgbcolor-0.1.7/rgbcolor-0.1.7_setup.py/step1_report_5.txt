  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'rgbcolor' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read package metadata, dependencies, and description strings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are explicitly specified and static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package info and dependencies. It specifies a fixed version of 'requests' and includes descriptive metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The package description and author information appear legitimate and typical for an open-source project. The code is straightforward and aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
