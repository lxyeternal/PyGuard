{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'rgbcolor' Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'install_requires' list and package metadata fields such as 'name', 'version', 'author', and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous operations such as network communication, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata and dependency declarations into the setup process; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and descriptive fields. The dependency 'requests==2.31.0' is specified explicitly, but requests is a common HTTP library. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network operations are present within this script. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only specifies package information and dependencies in a typical manner.",
