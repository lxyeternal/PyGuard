{
  "purpose": "To set up and distribute a Python package named 'rgbcolor' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup.py script reads package configuration data, including dependencies and metadata. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing of untrusted input occur; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the script performs static configuration without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters, including name, version, packages, dependencies, author, description, and long_description. The dependencies are explicitly specified, and all values are static strings. There are no input prompts, external data processing, or code execution based on untrusted sources. The code is typical for a Python package setup with no suspicious elements or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It does not contain any code that could be used for supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
