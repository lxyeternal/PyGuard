  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools for the rgbcolor library.",
  "sources": "Explicitly defined in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, install_requires, author, description, long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup.py script that defines package metadata and dependencies. It imports from setuptools, specifies a fixed dependency on requests, and includes descriptive metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The author name 'Buggedoncord' is unconventional but not malicious. The code aligns with standard packaging practices and contains no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe package configuration. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high. No further action is necessary.",
