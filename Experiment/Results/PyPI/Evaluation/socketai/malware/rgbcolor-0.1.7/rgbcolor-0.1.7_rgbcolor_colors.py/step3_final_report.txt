  "purpose": "A static list of color names used as a data resource or configuration.",
  "sources": "The list of color name strings assigned to the variable 'names'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a static data definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a large, static list of color name strings assigned to a variable. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The list's size is extensive but does not imply malicious intent. The code serves as a resource, likely for styling or categorization purposes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list of color names with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
