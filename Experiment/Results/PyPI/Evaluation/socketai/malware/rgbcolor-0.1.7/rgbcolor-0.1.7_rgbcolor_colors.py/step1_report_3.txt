  "purpose": "Define a list of color names as string constants.",
  "sources": "The list of color names assigned to the variable 'names'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes a list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a list definition containing color name strings assigned to the variable 'names'. There are no input sources, external data handling, or sensitive operations. No use of network, file I/O, environment variables, or code execution functions. The structure is straightforward and static. No signs of malicious or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a static list of color names with no malicious intent or security risks.",
