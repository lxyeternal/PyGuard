  "purpose": "This code defines a list of color names, likely for use in styling or display purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read; the code contains a static list of strings assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or transmitted; there are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the list is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script only declares a list of color name strings, which appear to be standard color identifiers. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no interactions with external systems. The list is comprehensive and static, serving likely as a resource for other modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a static list of color names. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
