  "purpose": "Define ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling using class variables.",
  "sources": "Dictionary 'names' mapping style names to codes, used in for loop to assign class variables.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; static assignment of style sequences.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with style constants for terminal output. It uses a dictionary and a loop to assign escape sequences to class variables. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is simple, static, and adheres to standard practices for such utilities. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal styling with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
