  "purpose": "Define terminal style escape sequences for text formatting",
  "sources": "The class variables and dictionary defining style names and escape codes",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed or output in an insecure manner",
  "flows": "The code initializes class variables based on predefined style codes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard style definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'style' with escape sequences for terminal styling, mapping style names to ANSI escape codes. It uses a dictionary to assign variables dynamically based on the style names, which is a common pattern for style utilities. No input/output handling, no network operations, and no code execution beyond variable assignment. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for terminal styling with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
