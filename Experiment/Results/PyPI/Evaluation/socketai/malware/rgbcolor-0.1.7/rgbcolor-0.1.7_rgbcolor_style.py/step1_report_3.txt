  "purpose": "Define terminal text styles and colors using ANSI escape codes",
  "sources": "Access to the 'names' dictionary for style codes",
  "sinks": "Generation of ANSI escape sequences for terminal output",
  "flows": "Dictionary lookup -> string formatting -> variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'style' that contains ANSI escape sequences for various text styles and colors. It includes a dictionary 'names' mapping style names to numeric codes. The for loop dynamically creates class variables named after style keys, assigning them formatted ANSI escape sequences. There are no input sources, no data leaks, no network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code simply provides styling constants for terminal output, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for terminal styling using ANSI escape codes. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and serves a benign purpose.",
