  "purpose": "Define terminal text styles and colors for formatting console output.",
  "sources": "The class defines a static dictionary of style names to numeric codes; no input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code only sets class variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class with styling constants for terminal output, mapping style names to ANSI escape sequences. It iterates over a predefined dictionary to assign class variables for each style, which is standard practice for terminal formatting libraries. No input/output handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a simple style utility module with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign style definition for terminal formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
