  "purpose": "Define ANSI escape sequences for text styling in terminal output",
  "sources": "The class attributes and the loop that assigns style variables based on the 'names' dictionary",
  "sinks": "No sink points or data flows that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "The loop dynamically creates variables for each style name with corresponding ANSI codes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code only sets up terminal styling variables",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output. It includes a dictionary of style names and their corresponding ANSI codes, and then dynamically creates class variables with these styles using a loop. No external input, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets up styling constants for terminal output and does not contain any malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It appears to be a benign utility class for formatting terminal text.",
