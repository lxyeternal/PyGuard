  "purpose": "Defines a class for styling terminal output with ANSI escape codes",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources used",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Uses a class attribute dictionary to dynamically create class variables for styling codes, which is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'style' with ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It includes a dictionary 'names' mapping style names to their ANSI codes. The loop creates class variables dynamically for each style, which is a common pattern for such utility modules. There are no input, output, or data manipulations beyond setting class attributes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and focused on styling terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for terminal styling with no malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
