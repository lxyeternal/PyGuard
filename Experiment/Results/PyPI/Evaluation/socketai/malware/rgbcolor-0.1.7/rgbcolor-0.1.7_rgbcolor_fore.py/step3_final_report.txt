  "purpose": "Define ANSI escape sequences for terminal colors based on a list of color names.",
  "sources": "Import of 'names' from '.colors' module; iteration over 'names' list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "Loop over 'names' to assign escape sequences to class variables via 'vars()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'vars()' for dynamic attribute creation; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of color names and assigns corresponding ANSI escape sequences to class variables dynamically. It does not handle user input, network data, or external sources. The use of 'vars()' is standard for such utility classes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is straightforward, and the implementation aligns with typical terminal color utilities. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for defining terminal color escape sequences. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dynamic attribute assignment is standard and safe given the controlled 'names' list. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
