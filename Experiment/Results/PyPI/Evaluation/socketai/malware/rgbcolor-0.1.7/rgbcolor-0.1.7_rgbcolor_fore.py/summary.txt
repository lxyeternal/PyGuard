  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for defining terminal color escape sequences. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dynamic attribute assignment is standard and safe given the controlled 'names' list. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence is high."
