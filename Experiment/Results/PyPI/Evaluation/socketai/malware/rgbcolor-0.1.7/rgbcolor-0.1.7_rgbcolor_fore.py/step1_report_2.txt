  "purpose": "Define terminal color escape sequences based on a list of color names imported from a module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'names' from the 'colors' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code only defines class variables for color escape sequences.",
  "flows": "Import 'names' -> Loop over 'names' to assign escape sequences to class variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; dynamic variable creation via vars() is common for such use cases.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a list of color names and dynamically assigns ANSI escape sequences to class variables named after each color. The loop correctly iterates over 'names' and constructs escape sequences. No user input, untrusted data, or external communication is present. The approach is straightforward and typical for defining terminal color codes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. It appears as a standard utility class for terminal color formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for defining color escape sequences and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
