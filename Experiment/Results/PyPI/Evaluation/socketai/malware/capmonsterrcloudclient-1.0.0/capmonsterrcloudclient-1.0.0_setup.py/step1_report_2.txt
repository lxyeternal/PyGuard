  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes decrypted code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, requests, fernet), decrypts code with Fernet, executes code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially malicious, from Fernet decryption.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code via exec(), potentially running malicious code supplied within the encrypted payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet to decrypt code at runtime and execute via exec() is suspicious. The long description appears obfuscated or meaningless, possibly to hide intent. No clear legitimate purpose for decrypting and executing code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard modules and defines package metadata. The custom install class 'GruppeInstall' overrides run(). On Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it with exec(). This pattern suggests dynamic code execution from a potentially malicious source, especially given the use of Fernet encryption and exec() during package installation, which is unusual and risky. No other benign functionality is evident. The encrypted payload's purpose cannot be determined but executing decrypted code at install time poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes suspicious behavior: decrypting and executing code dynamically during installation, which could be malicious. This pattern indicates a high security concern and potential backdoor. The package should not be used without further investigation.",
