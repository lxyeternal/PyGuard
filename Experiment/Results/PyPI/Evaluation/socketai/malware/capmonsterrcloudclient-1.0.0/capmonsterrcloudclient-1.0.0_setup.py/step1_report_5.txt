{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with an installation class that executes encrypted code during installation if the OS is Windows.",
  "sources": "OS check, import statements, and execution of decrypted code inside the run() method of GruppeInstall class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary code or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "OS check -> import modules -> decrypt and execute code with exec() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted data is suspicious; the decryption key and data are hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor. The code encrypts and runs code dynamically during installation, which is unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via exec(). The encrypted string and key are hardcoded, which could be used to run malicious code hidden within the encrypted payload. The purpose of this dynamic execution is unclear and poses a significant security risk, indicating potential backdoor or malicious activity. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the dynamic execution component is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a suspicious dynamic execution of decrypted code during installation, which is a common technique for malware or backdoors. The hardcoded key and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package potentially dangerous.",
