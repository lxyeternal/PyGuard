{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes Fernet-encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Fernet key and encrypted payload within the 'run' method of the custom 'GruppeInstall' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec() during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the Fernet key and encrypted data are read, then decrypted, and the resulting code is executed with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload; dynamic code execution via exec(); decryption and execution happen during installation, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and defines package metadata. The custom 'GruppeInstall' class overrides the 'run' method, which, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded key, executing it with exec(). The presence of hardcoded cryptographic material and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly suggest malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The code does not perform any other apparent function besides this decryption and execution step. This pattern is typical of malicious packages aiming to hide payloads and execute arbitrary code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior through hardcoded cryptographic secrets and dynamic code execution during installation. It appears to implement a backdoor or malicious payload, posing a significant security threat.",
