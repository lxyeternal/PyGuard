      "conclusion": "The code contains a high probability of malicious behavior, acting as a backdoor by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation. The pattern of hardcoded cryptographic secrets, decryption, and runtime execution is characteristic of malware. The high malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate."
