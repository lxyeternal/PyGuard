  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded endpoints, indicating malicious potential. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the observed patterns. No adjustments are necessary; the code should be treated as potentially malicious with high confidence."
