{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility script, possibly for data processing or system information gathering.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input via input(), and possibly files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include printing sensitive data to the console, writing to files, or sending data over the network if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables and user input to sinks like output functions or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code not present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input and environment data, processes it using standard functions, and outputs results. No suspicious code constructs, no malicious network activity, or credential theft observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of malware or sabotage evident. The overall structure and formatting are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no suspicious activity or malware features detected.",
