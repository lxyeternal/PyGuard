  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, user input, dynamic imports, eval()/exec(), hardcoded URLs/IPs, obfuscated control flow.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, code execution points, data leaks via environment variables or input.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to code execution functions (eval()/exec()), network endpoints, data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscated control flow, hardcoded URLs/IPs, dynamic imports, complex control structures, inconsistent variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code contains typical patterns of suspicious or malicious scripts, such as eval()/exec() usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded communication endpoints, indicating potential remote code execution or data exfiltration. Dynamic imports and complex control flow further suggest obfuscation. No benign code or standard data processing routines are evident. The presence of these patterns justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, with a high security risk. Absence of code in some reports is correctly noted as non-analyzable, leading to zero scores. Overall, the analysis aligns with the described behaviors, and the scores are consistent with the threat levels indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded endpoints, indicating malicious potential. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the observed patterns. No adjustments are necessary; the code should be treated as potentially malicious with high confidence.",
