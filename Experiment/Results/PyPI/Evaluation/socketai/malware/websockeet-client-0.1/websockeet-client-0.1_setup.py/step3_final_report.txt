{
  "purpose": "Heavily obfuscated setup script that performs system modifications, package installation, and privilege checks, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, filesystem traversal, system info, and user privilege checks.",
  "sinks": "Calls to pip.main() for package installation, creation of directories and shortcuts, file write operations, system privilege escalation, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated string assembly leading to dynamic import and execution; conditional execution based on command-line args and privilege checks; system modifications and file manipulations based on obfuscated conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex, meaningless calculations; variable names in non-Latin characters; dynamic string assembly for module names and commands; conditional privilege escalation and system modifications; misspelled package name 'websockeet-client'.",
  "analysis": "The code employs extensive obfuscation via complex bitwise and arithmetic operations, dynamic string assembly, and indirect module imports. It performs system-level actions such as installing packages via pip, creating directories, shortcuts, and manipulating files. It checks for admin privileges and interacts with environment variables, indicating potential system compromise or backdoor behavior. The use of deprecated pip.main() and misspelled package name further suggest malicious intent. The code's structure aims to hide malicious payloads and evade detection, consistent with malware or sabotage scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is almost certainly malicious, designed to perform covert system modifications, privilege escalation, and possibly establish persistence or backdoors. Its heavy obfuscation and system interactions justify a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be treated as a malicious package and removed from environments immediately.",
