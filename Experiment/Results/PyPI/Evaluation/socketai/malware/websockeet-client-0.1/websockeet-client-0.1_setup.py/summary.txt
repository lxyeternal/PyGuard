  "conclusion": "The script is almost certainly malicious, designed to perform covert system modifications, privilege escalation, and possibly establish persistence or backdoors. Its heavy obfuscation and system interactions justify a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be treated as a malicious package and removed from environments immediately."
