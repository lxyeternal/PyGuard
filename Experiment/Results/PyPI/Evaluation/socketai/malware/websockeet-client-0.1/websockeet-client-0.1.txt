      "conclusion": "The script is almost certainly malicious, designed to perform covert system modifications, privilege escalation, and possibly establish persistence or backdoors. Its heavy obfuscation and system interactions justify a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be treated as a malicious package and removed from environments immediately."

      "obfuscated": 0.3,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily in Report 2 due to features like dynamic execution and obfuscation. Adjusting the malware score upward in Report 2 to 0.4 provides a more accurate reflection of potential risks. The other reports are consistent with their limited content, and no confirmed malicious activity is present. The supply chain appears relatively secure, but vigilance is advised if code details become available."
