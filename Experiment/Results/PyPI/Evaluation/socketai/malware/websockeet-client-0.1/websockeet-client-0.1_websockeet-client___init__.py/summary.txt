  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily in Report 2 due to features like dynamic execution and obfuscation. Adjusting the malware score upward in Report 2 to 0.4 provides a more accurate reflection of potential risks. The other reports are consistent with their limited content, and no confirmed malicious activity is present. The supply chain appears relatively secure, but vigilance is advised if code details become available."
