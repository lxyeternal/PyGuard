  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'xgoogle_cloud_core'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name and version, and uses find_packages() to list package directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply executes package setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package setup, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed string parameters. It is a typical package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. No external inputs, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. It solely serves to package the code for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified.",
