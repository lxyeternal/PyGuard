  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and discovering packages.",
  "sources": "Static strings for name and version, find_packages() function inspecting directory structure.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external inputs are present. The code is typical for Python packaging and contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its safety. The only minor inconsistency is the security risk score in report 5, which should be adjusted from 0.1 to 0 for accuracy.",
