  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools.\n- The code only contains static strings and standard function calls.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- Justification: The code is a minimal, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion, emphasizing the absence of suspicious behavior.\n- Scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also finds no malicious intent or security concerns.\n- Scores consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning; standard setup script.\n- Scores consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) despite no suspicious code.\n- Justification: perhaps an overly cautious default, but given the analysis, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report:** No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: all reports correctly assign 0.\n  - Obfuscated: all assign 0, appropriate.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0, except report 5 which assigns 0.1; this is acceptable given the benign nature but could be slightly inflated.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no dynamic behavior, no external inputs, and no obfuscation, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- Obfuscated should remain 0.\n- Security risk should be 0 or very close to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering minimal default caution)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, with only a slight over-caution in report 5.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- Scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.",
