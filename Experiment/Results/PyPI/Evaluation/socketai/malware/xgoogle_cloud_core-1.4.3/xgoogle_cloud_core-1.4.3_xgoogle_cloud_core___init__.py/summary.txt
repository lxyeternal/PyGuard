  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, employing encoding, obfuscation, and multiple network channels to transmit system information stealthily. While it does not contain destructive payloads, its covert nature and exfiltration techniques pose a high security risk. The malware score is justified at approximately 0.75, the obfuscation at around 0.7, and the overall security risk at about 0.85."
