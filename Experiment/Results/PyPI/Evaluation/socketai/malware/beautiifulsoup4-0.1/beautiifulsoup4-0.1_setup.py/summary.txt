  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and performs actions consistent with malicious intent, including system modifications, package installations, shortcut creation, and environment variable manipulations. The heavy obfuscation, suspicious module usage, and conditional logic based on obscure numeric comparisons strongly suggest it is malicious. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.85, indicating a high probability of malware. The malware score is also high (~0.9), reflecting malicious behavior such as covert system modifications and potential malware delivery."
