  "conclusion": "The majority of the code snippets are benign with no active malicious behavior. Report 5 presents suspicious patterns like obfuscation and dynamic code execution, suggesting moderate concern. Adjusting malware and security risk scores for report 5 to reflect these patterns improves accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears safe, but continued monitoring for obfuscation and dynamic behaviors is recommended."
