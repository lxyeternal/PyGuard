  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script, likely for data processing or automation, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to incomplete or missing code context.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, possibly reads from files or network sources depending on further code not provided.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints output, or sends data over network connections, depending on further code not visible here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external sources into processing functions, with outputs potentially sent to files, network, or console.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code present; the code is minimal and appears straightforward. Lack of context makes it difficult to identify hidden malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal and does not contain suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. Without additional context or full code, no malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is typical for utility scripts. No anomalies are detected within the visible snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but incomplete context prevents definitive assessment.",
