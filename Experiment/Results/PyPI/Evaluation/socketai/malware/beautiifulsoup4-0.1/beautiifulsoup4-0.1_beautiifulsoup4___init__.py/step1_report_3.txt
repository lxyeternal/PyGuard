{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for processing data, possibly for a network-related or data manipulation task. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the provided content.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters or imported modules, but no external data sources such as files, network connections, or environment variables are clearly accessed in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include output functions, database operations, or network transmissions, but none are explicitly present or invoked with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through processing functions without evident transformation or untrusted data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and adheres to common Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing tasks, importing standard libraries and defining functions. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The absence of external data sources or sinks reduces suspicion. The code lacks complex or unusual patterns that would suggest obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears to be a standard data processing script with no signs of sabotage or malware. The confidence level in this assessment is high, given the limited scope and straightforward nature of the code.",
