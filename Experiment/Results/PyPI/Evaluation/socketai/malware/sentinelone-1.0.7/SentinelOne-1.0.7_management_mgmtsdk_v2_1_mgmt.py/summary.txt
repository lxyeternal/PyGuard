  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK extension with a single dynamic invocation ('api.run()') that is typical in SDK patterns. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. To ensure safety, review the implementation of 'api.run()' if 'api' source is untrusted, but otherwise, the code is considered low risk."
