  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API client wrapper for marketplace application management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code relies on external constants and a client object for HTTP requests, which appear standard.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are evident.\n- The flow of data is from controlled method parameters into API calls, with proper response validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The logic is straightforward: construct query parameters, make API calls, handle responses.\n- The API endpoints are imported constants, used in a typical manner.\n- The response handling includes status code checks and exception raising, which is standard.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident.\n- The code's flow and structure appear correct and consistent.\n- The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly note that the code depends on external modules and constants; if these are compromised, the overall security could be affected. However, based solely on this code, no malicious activity is present.\n- The code handles untrusted input only via method parameters, which are presumably controlled by the caller.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard for such API wrappers)\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code is a typical SDK client for API interactions, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors.\n- The overall structure and logic are safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
