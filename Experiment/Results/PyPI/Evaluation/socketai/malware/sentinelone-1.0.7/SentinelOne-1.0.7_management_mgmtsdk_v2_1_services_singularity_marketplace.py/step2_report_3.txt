  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a client SDK wrapping API calls for marketplace application management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The code performs standard request construction, response validation, and error handling.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The use of external constants for endpoints suggests standard practices.\n- The input parameters are controlled by the caller, not directly from untrusted sources within the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious code?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is straightforward and standard in design.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No evident vulnerabilities. The code does not process user input directly into system commands or execute code dynamically.\n\n- **Malware or malicious intent?**  \n  None detected. All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on this.\n\n- **Security risks?**  \n  Very low, mostly around potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Issues with the reports' reasoning or scores:\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.1-0.2, which seems reasonable given the code.\n\n- **Any overestimation?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Any underestimation?**  \n  No. The assessments are conservative and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Input validation or sanitization:**  \n  The code relies on external `get_query_params` method and constants for endpoints. If these are controlled or sanitized elsewhere, the risk remains low. The code itself does not perform risky operations.\n\n- **Response handling:**  \n  Proper status code checks and exception raising are in place, reducing risk of mishandling data.\n\n- **Potential for abuse:**  \n  Since the code is an API wrapper, the main concern would be if untrusted input reaches the API endpoints. However, this is outside the scope of this code segment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** (low, mostly due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all points, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code appears safe, well-structured, and standard. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, standard API client)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, with minimal security concern based on the provided code. Proper input validation at the caller level is recommended, but within this code segment, no issues are evident.",
