  "purpose": "Defines a set of classes and methods for constructing and validating query filters for an API, supporting various scope filters and operators.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods, input parameters for 'apply', 'get_query_params', and 'SplittedHelper' class.",
  "sinks": "Construction of filter dictionaries, validation exceptions, and string transformations for query parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (filter arguments) -> 'get_query_params' -> 'SplittedHelper' -> 'apply' -> filter.filters dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No unsafe data handling practices. No suspicious network activity or hidden code. The code primarily constructs query parameters and does not execute system commands or perform I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for query filtering with classes representing different scope filters. It performs input validation, constructs filter dictionaries, and transforms query parameters for API requests. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. It relies on exception raising for invalid input but does not execute external code or access sensitive system features. The use of string formatting is safe in this context, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing query filters, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation, constructs query parameters, and supports various scope filters without any malicious intent or security flaws.",
