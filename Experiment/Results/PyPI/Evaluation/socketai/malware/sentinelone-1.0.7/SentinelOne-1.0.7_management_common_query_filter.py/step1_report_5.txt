{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for building and applying query filters with support for different operators, primarily for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads are from class initializations, method parameters (e.g., key, val, filter_args), and class attributes (QUERY_ARGS). No direct external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "The apply() method modifies internal filter dictionaries; get_query_params() constructs filter dictionaries based on input parameters. No data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input filter arguments flow into apply() and get_query_params(), constructing filter conditions; these are stored in internal dictionaries for API query formation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, code injection, or obfuscated code, are present. The only exception is the usage of string formatting in exception messages, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to define and validate query filters with operator support. It validates allowed filters and operators, transforming them into API query parameters. There are no signs of malicious behaviors, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code adheres to expected patterns for filter construction, with safe string handling. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of query filter classes for API usage, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to build validated query parameters based on defined rules.",
