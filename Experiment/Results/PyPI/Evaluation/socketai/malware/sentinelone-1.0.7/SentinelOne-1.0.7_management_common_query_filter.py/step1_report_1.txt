{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing and applying query filters with support for various operators, primarily to facilitate API query parameter construction.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as 'filter_args' (a dictionary of filter criteria) and 'query_filter' (an object containing filters). There are no direct sources of untrusted external input such as network or file input shown here.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates internal dictionaries for filter representation; no direct sinks like network calls or system modifications are present within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data from filter_args or query_filter flows through 'get_query_params' and 'apply' methods, transforming filter criteria into query parameter dictionaries with potential transformations via 'transform'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code appears standard for query filter construction with no obfuscated elements or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward query filter management, with classes defining allowed filters and operators. It performs validation, transformation, and assembly of query parameters. No external calls, network operations, or sensitive data handling are evident. The use of exception handling and clear class structures indicates typical application logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It is purely utility code for filter management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of query filter handling with no malicious intent detected. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within its scope. The overall security risk score is low, and the confidence level is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
