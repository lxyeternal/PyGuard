  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward utility for constructing query filters, with no external input sources, sinks, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code appears standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's utility nature and absence of external calls or malicious patterns, the low risk score is justified. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code constructs query filters safely, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical filter builder with proper validation, and no malicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard filter construction framework with scope filters.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no external system interactions, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are justified.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign and well-structured. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Assessment:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on safe input validation and filter construction.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external system interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a utility class with no security concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a safe, structured filter builder with no external input reading or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external system calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's straightforward structure.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk due to the utility nature of the code, with no external dependencies or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, as the code is purely for query filtering with validation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of query filter management with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1    |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code provided.",
