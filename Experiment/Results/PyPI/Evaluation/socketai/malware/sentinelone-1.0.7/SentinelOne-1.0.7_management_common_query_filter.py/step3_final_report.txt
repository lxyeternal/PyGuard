{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for constructing, validating, and transforming query filters for an API, facilitating safe and structured query parameter management.",
  "sources": "Method parameters and internal class attributes where filter data is received and processed.",
  "sinks": "Internal dictionaries storing filter key-value pairs; no external data leaks or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method arguments into validation and transformation functions, ultimately populating filter dictionaries used for API queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing query filters, performing validation, transformation, and assembly of query parameters. It uses standard validation and string formatting, with no external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Exception handling is appropriate, and the logic is clear and maintainable. No anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for API query filtering with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors, and the security risk is minimal.",
