{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for constructing and validating query filters for an API, including various scope filters with allowed query parameters and operators.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'key', 'val', and 'filter_args' in 'apply' and 'get_query_params'. It also reads class attributes like 'QUERY_ARGS'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'filters' dictionary where filter conditions are stored, which could be used in API calls or database queries. There are no direct data leaks or unsafe system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'filter_args' or method arguments flows into 'apply' method, which validates and transforms it into 'filters' dictionary entries, potentially used for API or database queries.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a query filter builder. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used. No external network or system interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements classes to construct and validate query filters for an API. It allows defining allowed fields and operators, transforming filter conditions into query parameters. The 'apply' method ensures only permitted filters are used. The 'get_query_params' method builds the filter dictionary from either a filter object or keyword arguments. The structure is typical and does not contain malicious logic. It relies on exception raising for invalid inputs but does not perform any insecure operations. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent, nor suspicious external communications, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a query filter construction framework. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of network calls, data exfiltration, or secret handling indicates low risk.",
