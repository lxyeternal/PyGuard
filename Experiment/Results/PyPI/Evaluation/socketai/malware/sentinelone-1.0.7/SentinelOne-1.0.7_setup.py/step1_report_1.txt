{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'SentinelOne' with version '1.0.7' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned for package version and the 'setup' function that may read package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function writes package metadata; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; static metadata assignment with no external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'license' field with a string that is identical to the package name; no apparent malicious anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging tools 'setuptools', defines a version string, and calls 'setup' with package name, version, and license. There is no user input, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns or malicious code segments are present. The license field's value is a straightforward string, not an indicator of malicious intent. The code appears to be a minimal setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign setup script defining package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
