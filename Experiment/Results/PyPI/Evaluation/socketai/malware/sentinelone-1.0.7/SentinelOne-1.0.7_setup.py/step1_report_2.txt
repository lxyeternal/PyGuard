{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'SentinelOne' to define package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package_version; no input reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The license field uses a non-standard value 'SentinelOne', but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script importing standard setuptools functions, defining a version variable, and calling setup with basic metadata. No dynamic code execution, user input, network operations, or other risky behaviors are present. The license value is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the script appears typical for a Python package setup without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and does not contain any suspicious or malicious operations.",
