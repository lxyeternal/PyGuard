  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal setup script for a Python package named 'SentinelOne' with version '1.0.7'.\n- The code only imports standard setuptools functions, defines static variables, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The license field contains the string 'SentinelOne', which is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code provided. All reports correctly identify that the setup script is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malicious activity:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The only minor point is the unconventional 'license' string, but it is not an issue per se.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since there's no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no untrusted input, the scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The reports correctly avoid overestimating risk or malware presence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the reports are accurate. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
