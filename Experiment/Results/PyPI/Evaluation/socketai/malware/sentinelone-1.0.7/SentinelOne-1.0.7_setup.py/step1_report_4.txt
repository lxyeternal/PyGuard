{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the SentinelOne Python package, defining its name, version, and license.",
  "sources": "Static values assigned to variables and package metadata in setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The license field is set to 'SentinelOne', which appears to be a placeholder or company name, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version string, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a minimal, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply specifies package metadata without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
