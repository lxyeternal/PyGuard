{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for the Python project 'SentinelOne'.",
  "sources": "Static data: package name, version, license declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the license field uses a name instead of a standard license identifier, which may be unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions and sets package metadata including name, version, and license. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read. No code execution or network activity occurs. The license field is atypical but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script for Python with no malicious intent. It merely defines package metadata without any suspicious behavior or security issues.",
