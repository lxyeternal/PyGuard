  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (exec, eval), environment variables, system calls, network functions, file operations, and code structure patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, and dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables feed into dynamic execution or network functions; data may flow from sources to sinks via function calls or variable assignments, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' or 'eval' with untrusted input, obfuscated variable names, complex conditional logic, dynamic code generation, and suspicious network or system calls without clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as dynamic execution ('exec', 'eval'), obfuscation, and complex control flows that are typical indicators of suspicious or malicious intent. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, these patterns increase the likelihood of covert malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.45, obfuscated ~0.6, security risk ~0.55) are justified given the behaviors. Benign patterns such as standard library usage and lack of hardcoded secrets support low malware scores in other reports. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the described code behaviors, with Report 2 being the most suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious patterns like dynamic execution and obfuscation, warranting moderate concern. However, there is no definitive evidence of malicious payloads. The scores assigned are appropriate, with Report 2 requiring monitoring. All reports are internally consistent and accurately reflect the observed behaviors.",
