  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and token storage for HTTP requests",
  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token variables",
  "sinks": "Potential use of stored token and cookies in HTTP requests or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "Token and cookies may be used in subsequent network requests, but not shown in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an initializer that sets up headers, cookies, and token storage for authentication purposes. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no network communication, and no suspicious code structures. The class appears to be a standard part of an authentication mechanism. No malicious or maliciously intented code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a basic setup for an authentication manager, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for such use cases.",
