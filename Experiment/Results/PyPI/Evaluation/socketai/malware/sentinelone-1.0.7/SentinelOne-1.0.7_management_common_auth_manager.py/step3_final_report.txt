{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple authentication management class that initializes headers, cookies, and a token attribute, likely for handling authentication data within a larger system.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only initializes internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other effects, as the code does not perform any data transmission or external operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets static attributes without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns. It lacks external inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class 'AuthManager' initializes three attributes: headers with a content-type, an empty cookies dictionary, and a token set to None. It contains no external data reading, network communication, or malicious code. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for an authentication data holder. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating minimal security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
