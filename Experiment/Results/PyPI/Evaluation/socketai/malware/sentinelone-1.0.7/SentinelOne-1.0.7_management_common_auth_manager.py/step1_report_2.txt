{
  "purpose": "Defines an authentication manager class that initializes headers, cookies, and a token for HTTP-based authentication.",
  "sources": "None; no data input or external data reading is present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process or transmit data that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the class simply initializes attributes without performing any data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. The class appears to be a straightforward setup for managing authentication data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that sets default headers and initializes empty cookies and token attributes. It lacks any input handling, external data reading, or network communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this snippet. The simplicity suggests it is part of a larger authentication workflow but on its own, it does not perform any harmful or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving as a basic setup for an authentication management object without any malicious or suspicious features.",
