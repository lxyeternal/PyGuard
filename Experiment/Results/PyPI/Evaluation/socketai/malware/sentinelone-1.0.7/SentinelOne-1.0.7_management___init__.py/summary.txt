  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The low risk score reflects potential misconfiguration due to environment variable reliance but does not indicate a security threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are accurate. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use with minimal configuration risk."
