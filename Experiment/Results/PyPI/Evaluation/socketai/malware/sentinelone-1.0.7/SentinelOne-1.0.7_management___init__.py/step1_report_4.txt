  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with dynamic log path and level settings based on environment variables",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system and tempfile modules for paths and platform info",
  "sinks": "FileHandler writes logs to a file path determined at runtime; StreamHandler outputs logs to stdout",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log path and level, which then determine the behavior of logging handlers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of environment variables is standard, but potential for misconfiguration exists",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically sets up logging based on environment variables, with no suspicious code injections or backdoors. It reads environment variables for log configurations, which could be manipulated but is typical for configurable logging. No data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious network activity is evident. The code does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions beyond standard logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical logging configuration script that does not exhibit malicious behavior. It uses environment variables for flexible setup but does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious activity.",
