  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and logging level based on environment variables, primarily for debugging and runtime diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'.",
  "sinks": "Log file path specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH'; output to stdout via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> log path and level -> logger setup -> logging handlers -> output (file or stdout).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard logging setup with environment-based configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from environment variables to set up logging handlers, including a log file and console output. It uses standard Python logging facilities with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious commands. The log file path is configurable, but the code trusts the environment variable without validation, which could lead to logging to unintended locations if maliciously set. However, this does not constitute malicious behavior; it's a typical configuration pattern. No network activity, code injection, or data theft is present. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging configuration based on environment variables without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is typical in application setup routines and does not pose a security risk.",
