  "purpose": "Sets up logging handlers with configurable log path and level via environment variables, defaulting to system temp directory and 'debug' level.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform detection for temp directory.",
  "sinks": "Log file written to path specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or default; logs output to stdout via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and path; handlers write logs to file and stdout based on configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Trusts environment variables without validation; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging setup that reads environment variables for configuration. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity. The use of environment variables without validation could lead to misconfiguration but is common practice. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering the slight potential for misconfiguration. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The low risk score reflects potential misconfiguration due to environment variable reliance but does not indicate a security threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are accurate. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for production use with minimal configuration risk.",
