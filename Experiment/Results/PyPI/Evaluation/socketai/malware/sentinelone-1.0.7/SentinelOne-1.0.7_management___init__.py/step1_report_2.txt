  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' with dynamic log path and level based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform detection; tempfile.gettempdir()",
  "sinks": "Logging output written to specified log file and stdout",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file location and level, affecting where and how logs are stored and displayed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; environment variables used appropriately",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers based on environment variables with fallback defaults. It determines the log file location dynamically, which could be customized via environment variables. The log level is also configurable. No use of untrusted input is evident outside environment variables, which are standard and handled safely. The logic appears straightforward and intended solely for logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup that dynamically configures log handlers based on environment variables. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not perform any unsafe or malicious actions, and it appears to be a typical configuration pattern.",
