  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the MgmtSdk module, including setting log file path and level based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' are read to determine log configuration.",
  "sinks": "The log file path derived from environment variables could be used to write logs to an arbitrary location; environment variables are also read for log level, but do not directly pose a security issue.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; log handlers write to files and stdout as sinks; configuration occurs based on environment variable values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard logging setup. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a logging setup that is configurable via environment variables. It uses standard library modules, sets handlers for file and stdout, and defaults to safe locations and levels. The log file path can be influenced by environment variables, which could potentially be manipulated to write logs to unintended locations, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. No malicious actions, such as data exfiltration or system compromise, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration setup with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It respects environment variable configuration but does not perform any harmful actions or obfuscation.",
