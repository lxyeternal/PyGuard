  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' module, setting log level and log file location based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for configuration data.",
  "fires": "FileHandler writes logs to a specified file; StreamHandler outputs logs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and file path; handlers output log data accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of environment variables for log configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers with configurable log levels and file paths, using environment variables. The log path defaults to a temp directory, and the log level defaults to 'debug'. The configuration can be toggled via an environment variable. No external data sources, user inputs, or potentially malicious functions are involved. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to logging setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with configurable options through environment variables. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration, and no suspicious or malicious actions are evident.",
