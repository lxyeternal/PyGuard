  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints used by the SentinelOne management system to communicate with various services and features.",
  "sources": "Constants defining URL paths for API endpoints, primarily string literals and formatted strings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include URL construction with formatted strings (e.g., 'threats/mitigate/{}'), which could be misused if formatted with untrusted input, and endpoints related to sensitive operations like agent management, threat handling, and remote scripts.",
  "flows": "Data flows originate from the usage of string format placeholders in endpoint paths, where untrusted input could be injected into these URLs, especially in dynamic endpoint construction such as 'threats/mitigate/{}', 'agents/{}/actions/fetch-files', etc.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward, consisting of static string constants. No signs of hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or unusual logic appears.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of API endpoint definitions with static strings and formatted URL patterns. These endpoints facilitate various management operations including threats, agents, firewall, ranger, and application management. The presence of formatted strings introduces potential injection points if these URL parts are constructed from untrusted inputs. However, the code itself does not include any execution logic, input handling, or data processing. It is purely a configuration of URL paths. No malicious behavior or malware patterns are evident. The straightforward nature suggests these are standard API endpoint constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static list of API endpoint paths used by the SentinelOne management system. It does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only consideration is the safe use of formatted strings to prevent injection when constructing URLs dynamically, but this risk resides outside this code snippet. Overall, the code is safe and intended for configuration purposes.",
