{
  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints for various API actions related to threat management, agent actions, asset inventory, and other security operations within a cybersecurity management platform.",
  "sources": "Constants assigning URL endpoint strings, including formatted strings for dynamic paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive endpoint URLs used for API requests, especially those involving file downloads, remote script execution, and agent management.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this code only defines URL constants; there are no runtime data flows or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. All endpoints are straightforward string constants. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of string constants representing API endpoints used throughout a security management system. The endpoints cover a broad range of functions such as threat management, agent operations, asset inventories, firewall controls, and third-party integrations. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets. The endpoints are standard and do not contain suspicious or malicious patterns. Since the code is purely defining constants, it poses no immediate security risks or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malware functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code only consists of endpoint URL definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard configuration of API paths used in a cybersecurity management platform. No security concerns or malware signals are detected.",
