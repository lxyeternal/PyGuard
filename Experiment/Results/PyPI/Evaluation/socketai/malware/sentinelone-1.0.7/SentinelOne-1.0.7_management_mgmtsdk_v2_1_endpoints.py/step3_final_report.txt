  "purpose": "Collection of static URL endpoint strings with some placeholders for dynamic parts, used for API communication within the SentinelOne management system.",
  "sources": "Static string constants, some with '{}' placeholders for runtime URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL construction points where untrusted input could be inserted, leading to injection if not validated.",
  "flows": "External input (not present in this code) inserted into URL templates during runtime, potentially leading to injection if improperly handled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '{}' placeholders in URL strings; no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoints, some with placeholders for dynamic URL segments. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the potential for injection if untrusted input is directly formatted into these URLs without validation, but this risk exists outside this static configuration. Malware scores are correctly zero; obfuscation is absent. Risk scores are minimal, reflecting the potential misuse if input validation is neglected during URL construction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of API endpoint definitions. The main security consideration is ensuring proper validation of URL parameters during runtime, which is outside the scope of this static code. Scores are appropriate given the context.",
