  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's nature as a static set of API endpoint constants.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes static URL strings, some with formatted placeholders.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that URL construction with untrusted input could be risky if not handled properly elsewhere, but the code itself is just static strings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The use of formatted strings is standard for dynamic URL building.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded. The code is safe; the main concern is proper input validation during URL construction outside this snippet.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code's static nature.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed. The report's malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies static string constants for API endpoints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Since the code only defines constants, no runtime data flow issues are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code, just straightforward constants.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate. No security risk or malware signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes static URL strings with some placeholders.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that these are used as request targets; no data flow issues in this code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment. The code is benign, with placeholders intended for safe runtime substitution.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, fitting the content.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, static strings with some formatted placeholders.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly states that dynamic URL construction depends on input validation elsewhere.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct. The code is a standard API route definition.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, suitable.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes static URL constants with placeholders.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that improper handling of dynamic segments could lead to injection if inputs are not validated, which is a valid point.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The presence of placeholders is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report appropriately emphasizes the importance of input validation during URL construction, but the code itself remains safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is minimal, which aligns with the static nature.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static string constants.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign collection of API endpoint definitions, with the only caveat being the use of formatted strings that should be handled securely during runtime URL construction.\n\n**My adjusted scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge that improper handling of dynamic URL segments could pose injection risks if not validated, but this is outside the scope of this static code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Proper input validation in the consuming code is necessary but not reflected here.",
