  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with obfuscation in Report 2 being the main concern. The overall malware score is set at 0.2, reflecting cautious suspicion due to obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity. The obfuscation score is adjusted to 0.6 to account for the moderate complexity noted, and the security risk score is maintained at 0.2. These estimates are consistent with the reports' reasoning and evidence, indicating a low but cautious security posture."
