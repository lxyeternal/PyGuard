  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code implements custom proxy connectors for aiohttp, supporting single and chained proxies.\n- The code parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and establishes network streams via the proxies.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The use of NoResolver to bypass DNS resolution is noted but is a legitimate feature.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- The main concern is the potential misuse of proxy chaining and untrusted proxy URLs, but this is a common feature and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors in the code. They focus on the potential for misuse but do not find any concrete evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code appears well-structured, with no obvious flaws. The only point of note is the use of NoResolver, which could be suspicious if used maliciously, but it is legitimate for bypassing DNS resolution.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign **0** to malware, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign **0**, which is justified as the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden features.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- All reports assign **0.2**, indicating a low but non-zero risk, mainly due to handling untrusted inputs (proxy URLs, credentials).\n- This seems reasonable; the code itself is not malicious but could be misused if inputs are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which aligns with the analysis that the code is generally safe but could be misused if untrusted inputs are provided.\n- The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk is low, reflecting the potential for misuse but no inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThese scores reflect the overall benign nature of the code, with a minor security concern regarding untrusted inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code could be flagged for caution if used with untrusted proxy URLs or credentials, but this is standard for proxy-related code.\n- The use of NoResolver could be exploited to hide DNS activity, but it is not malicious per se.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Value | Justification                                                                                   |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                               |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2          | Potential misuse with untrusted inputs, but no inherent malicious activity.                  |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.**",
