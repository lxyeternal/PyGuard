  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements custom proxy connectors supporting chaining, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The use of NoResolver may bypass DNS resolution, which could be privacy-sensitive but not malicious.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No, the code appears legitimate. Proxy creation and connection flow are standard.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant flaws detected. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0. The low risk score seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is a standard proxy connector with no malicious intent. The low risk score is justified. Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on credential handling and proxy chaining. No malicious code detected; standard practices.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No, the code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No, reasoning is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** The code handles credentials securely in configuration, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard proxy connection code supporting chaining, with no malicious patterns. The use of custom resolvers and proxy URLs is typical.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No, reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0. Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—proxy connection classes, standard practices, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is proxy routing; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—proxy management code supporting chaining, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across reports seem appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly related to handling untrusted inputs (proxy URLs and credentials), which is typical in proxy code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2**\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of proxy connectors for aiohttp, supporting chaining and custom resolvers, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the potential misuse if untrusted proxy URLs or credentials are supplied, but this is inherent to proxy configurations and not specific to malicious code.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and functional.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- The security risk is low, primarily due to the handling of external inputs, which is standard for such features.\n\n**Final note:** Maintain awareness of input validation when deploying in untrusted environments, but the code itself is secure.",
