  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code provides standard async functions for establishing proxy connections using `python_socks`. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The data flows are straightforward, and the functions validate inputs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's nature. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for malware score:** No malware or malicious intent is evident. The functions are utility routines for network connections.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy connection setup with no suspicious patterns. The use of `parse_proxy_url` is standard, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and the code relies on external trusted libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward proxy connection utility with input validation and no malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion: legitimate utility functions, no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is standard, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower risk, which is justified given the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or secret exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the functions accept untrusted input (`proxy_url`, `host`, `port`) and use external parsing, a minimal risk score of 0.2 is reasonable. The functions themselves do not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, legitimate implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal, due to untrusted input handling but no evident harm)\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for legitimate proxy connection management.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The report assessments are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
