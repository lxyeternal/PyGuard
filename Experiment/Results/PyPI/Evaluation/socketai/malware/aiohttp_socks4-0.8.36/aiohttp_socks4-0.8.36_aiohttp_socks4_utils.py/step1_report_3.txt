  "purpose": "Establish proxy-based network connections asynchronously using SOCKS proxies with customizable parameters.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function for proxy configuration; input parameters such as proxy_url, host, port, username, password.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection for establishing network connections; proxy.connect for socket creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy_url, host, port, credentials) -> parse_proxy_url (if proxy_url) -> Proxy.create -> proxy.connect -> network connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily manages network connection setup and proxy handling without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up asynchronous network connections through proxies, with explicit handling of proxy URLs and credentials. It performs input validation and uses established libraries for proxy parsing and connection management. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The logic appears consistent with standard proxy connection procedures, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for proxy-based network connection management. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is aligned with typical practices for proxy connections.",
