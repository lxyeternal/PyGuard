{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class with associated constants and exception aliases, providing compatibility and warnings for users.",
  "sources": "Import statements for warnings, exception classes, and ProxyType; class definitions; method definitions; usage of warnings.warn; inheritance from ProxyConnector.",
  "sinks": "Warnings.warn (possibly alerting users), super().__init__ (calling parent constructor), class methods.",
  "flows": "Initialization of SocksConnector calls super().__init__, potentially passing proxy_type; from_url class method calls super().from_url.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution; straightforward class and method structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for SOCKS versions, a deprecated warning function, and a subclass SocksConnector inheriting from ProxyConnector. It issues a deprecation warning when instantiated or called via from_url, encouraging use of ProxyConnector. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or harmful behavior. No external data sources or sinks that could lead to security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of warnings and inheritance appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code mainly serves as a backward compatibility layer with a deprecation warning. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
