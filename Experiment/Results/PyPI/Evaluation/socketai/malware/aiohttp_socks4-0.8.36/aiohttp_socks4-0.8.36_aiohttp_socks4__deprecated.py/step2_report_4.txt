  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a deprecated SocksConnector class wrapping around a ProxyConnector, with deprecation warnings, SOCKS version constants, and no evident malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, involving class inheritance, warnings, and parameter passing.\n- No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or network actions are directly involved in the code snippet.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The deprecation warnings suggest an API transition but do not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior.\n- The deprecation warning indicates outdated code but is standard practice.\n- No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious sinks are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- They appropriately assign low malware and security risk scores.\n- No overestimations or underestimations are evident.\n\n### Score analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, also justified.\n- **Risk score:** generally around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concern—appropriate given the code's function.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n- The code is non-malicious, with no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency and appropriateness:\n\n- The scores align well with the code's content.\n- The deprecation warnings do not introduce security issues; they are standard practice.\n- The lack of external data processing or network activity supports low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected) — consistent and justified.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation) — justified.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the minimal security concern, I would assign a risk score of **0.1 to 0.2**, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is purely infrastructural, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard and do not pose security risks.\n- The class design and method delegation are straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code issues:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk ≈ 0.1–0.2.\n- **Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malware present.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
