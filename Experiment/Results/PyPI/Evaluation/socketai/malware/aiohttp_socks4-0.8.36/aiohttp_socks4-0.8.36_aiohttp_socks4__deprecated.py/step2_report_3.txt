  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a wrapper around a proxy connector, primarily handling SOCKS proxy configuration with deprecation warnings.\n- No external data is processed insecurely.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code relies on standard modules and patterns, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**1. Are the issues present in the code?**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is mainly about defining a class for SOCKS proxy handling, with deprecation warnings and proper inheritance.  \n- No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- The code is straightforward and matches the description.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n- The reports uniformly conclude that there are no malicious or security issues, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- The reasoning that the deprecation warnings are standard and not malicious is sound.  \n- No logical flaws are apparent in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable.  \n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the clear and straightforward analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n- None of the reports assign a risk score > 0.5.  \n- Given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- No malware activity is detected or suggested.  \n- The malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- All reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as standard proxy handling with deprecation warnings.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**- Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n**- Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n**- Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging deprecation warnings)  \n\n**- Estimated scores based on the overall review:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warnings, but not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a SOCKS proxy connector wrapper with deprecation warnings. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score can remain low (~0.1-0.2), considering the deprecation warning but no actual security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions based on this review.",
