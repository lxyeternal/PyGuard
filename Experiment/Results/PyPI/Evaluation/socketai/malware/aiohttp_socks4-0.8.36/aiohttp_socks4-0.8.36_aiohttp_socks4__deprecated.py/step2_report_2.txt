  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving class definitions, deprecation warnings, and proxy configuration. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is primarily a wrapper around existing proxy classes with deprecation notices.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify the purpose, flow, and benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports are sound and do not contain errors.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to deprecation warnings and standard proxy handling. This seems reasonable.  \n   **Suggestion:** The scores are consistent and appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   **Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are justified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**  \n   All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected—no network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion:** Malware score remains 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports do not assume malicious intent; they only assess the code's behavior as benign.  \n   **Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.  \n   **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (minimal, related to deprecation warnings and standard proxy handling)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The deprecation warnings are standard practice and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, non-malicious proxy wrapper with deprecation notices, presenting no security concerns.",
