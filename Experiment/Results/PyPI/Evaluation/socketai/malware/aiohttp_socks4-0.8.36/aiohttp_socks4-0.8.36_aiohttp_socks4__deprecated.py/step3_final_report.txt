{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that wraps around an existing ProxyConnector, issuing deprecation warnings and managing SOCKS version constants.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__), the from_url class method, and the import statements for warnings and proxy modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The constructor and from_url method invoke the superclass methods with parameters; deprecation warnings are issued before class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for SOCKS versions, issues deprecation warnings for the SocksConnector class, and delegates initialization to the superclass. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain malicious code. The deprecation warning is standard and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deprecated wrapper for SOCKS proxy configuration with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
