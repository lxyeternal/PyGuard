{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated SocksConnector class for managing SOCKS proxy connections, and includes related constants and warnings for usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (socks_ver, url, kwargs) and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks. It primarily manages proxy configuration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_ver, url, kwargs) flow into class constructors and methods to configure proxy connections; no data is transmitted or manipulated in a malicious way.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of deprecated warnings is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines proxy version constants, issues a deprecation warning for the SocksConnector class, and manages proxy settings via class inheritance. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The use of warnings for deprecation is standard practice, and no unsafe or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation handling. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
