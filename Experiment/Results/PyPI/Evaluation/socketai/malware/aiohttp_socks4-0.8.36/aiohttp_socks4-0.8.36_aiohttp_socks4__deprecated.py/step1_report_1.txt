{
  "purpose": "Defines a SocksConnector class for proxy connection handling, including deprecation warnings and proxy type setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, python_socks, and local connector module; class and method definitions that process input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted data sources, no network connections, or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls flow through class inheritance and method overrides, but no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings indicates some legacy handling but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for proxy handling, defines proxy version constants, and a class that wraps around an existing ProxyConnector with deprecation warnings. The from_url method delegates to the superclass without processing untrusted data itself. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior detected. No signs of malware or security risks are present; the code appears to be standard proxy handling code with a deprecation notice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector with no suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
