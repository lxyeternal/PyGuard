  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code defines a deprecated SocksConnector class that wraps around an existing ProxyConnector.\n- It issues deprecation warnings to encourage transition to ProxyConnector.\n- It manages SOCKS version constants and proxies configuration.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign wrapper with deprecation notices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or backdoors are present.\n- No data leaks or external data processing that could lead to security risks.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only notable point is the deprecation warning, which indicates the class is outdated but not insecure.\n- No logical errors or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature. The small risk score accounts for deprecation notices but not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely for configuration and deprecation, a security risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- Malware score should remain 0; no malware detected.\n- Obfuscated score should stay 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The scores reflect the code's benign nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Keep low (~0.1–0.2), as the code is safe but deprecated.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warnings, but no actual security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, deprecated wrapper for SOCKS proxy configuration with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context where this code is used. If the overall project or environment involves untrusted inputs or network interactions elsewhere, the security posture could differ. But based solely on this snippet, it’s safe.",
