{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around a proxy connector for SOCKS proxies, including deprecation warnings for an older class and utilities for handling SOCKS versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks' and the local '.connector' module, usage of class methods and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Superclass method calls (super().__init__, super().from_url) and warnings. No untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization and class method calls that invoke superclass methods, with no data flow from external input to sensitive functions that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecation warnings suggests a transition in API, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports proxy-related modules and defines classes for SOCKS proxy configuration. It issues deprecation warnings for a class, encouraging use of an alternative. The constructor conditionally initializes the superclass with the appropriate proxy type. The from_url class method creates an instance from a URL, delegating to superclass. All operations are standard class setup, and no suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network actions outside standard library calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for SOCKS proxy configuration and deprecation handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
