{
  "purpose": "The code defines an interface for an aiohttp plugin that handles SOCKS proxy connections, including importing relevant classes and functions, and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', local modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated)",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the code primarily imports and exposes classes and functions without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is mostly declarative, setting up module exports and importing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module setup: it imports classes and functions from external and internal modules, then defines __all__ to specify public API components. There are no input sources such as user input or environment variables, nor any sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity. All imports are standard for a proxy-related library. The presence of deprecated imports suggests ongoing maintenance but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module definition for a Python package focused on SOCKS proxy support. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely organizes and exposes functions and classes for use by other parts of the application.",
