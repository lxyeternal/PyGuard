{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports, and exports related to SOCKS proxy support for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', relative imports from local modules (connector, utils, _deprecated).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication; purely module setup and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports from external library 'python_socks' and internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module-level metadata and imports necessary classes and functions. All imported modules appear standard for proxy handling functionality. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The presence of deprecated modules suggests maintenance but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a proxy-related library, with no malicious or suspicious content detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious.",
