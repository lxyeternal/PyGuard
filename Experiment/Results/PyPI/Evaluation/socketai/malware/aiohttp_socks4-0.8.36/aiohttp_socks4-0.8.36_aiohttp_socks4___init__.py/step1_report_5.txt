{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of an asyncio-based HTTP proxy library that provides proxy support for aiohttp, including SOCKS proxy functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'python_socks' and local modules ('connector', 'utils', '_deprecated') indicate data sources from external libraries and internal modules.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily exports classes and functions related to proxy handling; no sinks such as data transmission, network connections, or data leaks are directly present here.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing various classes and functions for proxy management and re-exporting them for external use. There are no data processing or untrusted input handling flows within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. All code is standard import/export statements with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions solely as an interface or module initializer, importing necessary components and exposing them via __all__. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any operations that could introduce security risks. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is evident. The code's structure and content are consistent with a standard Python module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and exports proxy-related classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code snippet.",
