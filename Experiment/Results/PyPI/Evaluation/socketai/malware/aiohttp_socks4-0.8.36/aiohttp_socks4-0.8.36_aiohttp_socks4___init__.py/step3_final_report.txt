{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for the 'aiohttp-socks' package, importing classes, functions, and constants from internal and external modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'python_socks' and internal modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated). No dynamic input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements establish source-to-export flows; no runtime data flow or untrusted data propagation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Deprecated imports indicate ongoing maintenance but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and functions and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, and all security signals are benign. The deprecated imports suggest maintenance but do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk—are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
