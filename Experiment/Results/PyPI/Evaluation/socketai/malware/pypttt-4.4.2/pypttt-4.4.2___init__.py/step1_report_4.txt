  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a message indicating installation and then calls the function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes internal function calls and print statements.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data is involved or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the function simply outputs a fixed string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple, with no suspicious or unusual features; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'ina' that prints a message and then calls it. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, and all components are typical for simple scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs a message indicating installation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
