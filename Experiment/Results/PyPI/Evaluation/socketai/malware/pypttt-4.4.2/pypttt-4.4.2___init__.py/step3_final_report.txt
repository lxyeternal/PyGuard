{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'installed' and then calls it, serving as a basic indicator or log message.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads no input, environment variables, or network data.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement, which outputs to standard output; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: function call leads to print output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal, static, and straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static script defining and calling a function that prints a message. It involves no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
