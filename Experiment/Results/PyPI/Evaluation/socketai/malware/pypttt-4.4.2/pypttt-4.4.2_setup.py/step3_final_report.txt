{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including exfiltrating system information, downloading, and executing a remote executable, which constitutes a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; remote URLs for data exfiltration and file download; the download and execution of 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains; writing and executing a downloaded file; system call via os.system to run the executable.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sends it via GET request to a remote server -> on Windows, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL -> executes the downloaded file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masking errors; downloading and executing a remote executable during setup; use of suspicious URLs; no obfuscation but malicious behavior is explicit.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects system info, exfiltrates it, downloads a potentially malicious executable, and runs it during the installation process. The URLs used are suspicious, and the actions are characteristic of malware. The broad exception handling masks errors, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs high-impact malicious activities, indicating a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious intent through data exfiltration, remote code download, and execution during package installation. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack vectors. The malware score should be set to 1.0, and the security risk score should also be 1.0, reflecting the high severity of the threat.",
