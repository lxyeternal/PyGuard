{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package and executing post-installation actions that include potentially malicious activities.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URL requests (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php and https://python-release.com/python-install.scr).",
  "sinks": "Fetching and executing a potentially malicious executable ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') using os.system, and sending environment info to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends it to a remote URL -> downloads a .exe file -> executes the downloaded file on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system info to a remote server, downloading and executing an executable during package installation, and suppressing errors with a broad try-except block. The URL 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com' are suspicious, as they do not appear to be legitimate Python repositories.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests, then defines a 'send' function that captures the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to a remote URL, and downloads/executed a file if on Windows. The 'PostInstallCommand' runs this function during package installation. The setup configuration specifies package info but leverages a custom install command that triggers malicious activities. The behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, including remote communication, data exfiltration, and remote code execution. The use of broad exception handling masks errors, potentially hiding malicious failures.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear signs of malicious behavior, including remote data exfiltration, remote code execution, and download-and-execute malware. It is highly likely to be malicious and should not be used.",
