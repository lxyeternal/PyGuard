{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package and execute additional installation steps that involve contacting a remote server and potentially executing a downloaded file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs. It also uses os.system to execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "os.system executes a file downloaded from an external URL, which could be malicious. Requests are made to external sites to retrieve data and files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is included in a GET request URL; the response from a URL is used to download and execute a file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes contacting a suspicious URL ('linkedopports.com') and executing a downloaded executable ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') without user consent. The code attempts to hide its actions within a setup script, and the URL used ('python-release.com') appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a 'send' function that retrieves an environment variable and makes HTTP requests. It then downloads an executable file and executes it without user interaction or validation. The execution of a remote file via os.system is a significant security concern, indicating potential malicious intent. The code runs during installation ('PostInstallCommand'), which can lead to automatic execution upon package installation, further increasing risk. The URLs used are suspicious and could host malicious content. The overall structure suggests an attempt to surreptitiously run malicious code on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by contacting suspicious URLs, downloading, and executing a file without user consent. It is likely designed to compromise the system during package installation. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
