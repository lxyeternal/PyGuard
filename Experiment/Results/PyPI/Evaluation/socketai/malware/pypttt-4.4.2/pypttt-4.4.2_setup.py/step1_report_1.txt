{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with a custom installation process that performs additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URLs for HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, executing downloaded files with os.system().",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read, then data is sent via HTTP GET request. If on Windows, a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except without specific error handling, downloads and executes an executable during install, sends system info to a remote server, and fetches a potentially malicious executable.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and requests library, defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to a remote URL, and if on Windows, downloads and executes an external executable. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the run method to call 'send' during installation. The setup configuration registers this custom command. The code performs network activity, collects environment info, and executes remote files, which are common behaviors in malicious supply chain attacks. The use of broad exception handling and executing downloaded files increases risk. No obfuscation or benign use of dependencies is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info, communicating with a remote server, and executing a downloaded executable during package installation. This indicates high malicious intent, representing a significant security threat.",
