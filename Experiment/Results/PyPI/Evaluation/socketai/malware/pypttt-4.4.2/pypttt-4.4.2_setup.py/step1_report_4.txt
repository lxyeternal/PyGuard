{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with custom post-install behavior, including sending data and potentially executing a downloaded file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; network requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'; file system operations for downloading and executing a file.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes a downloaded file; network requests that send environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> send() function's GET request; 'send()' -> downloads file -> executes file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Download and execution of an external executable during package installation; sending environment info to external URL; minimal error handling which silently ignores failures.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. During installation, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it. The try-except block suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures. These behaviors suggest potential malicious activity, including remote data exfiltration and arbitrary code execution. The code’s purpose is suspicious because it performs network communication, data transmission, and remote code execution during package installation, which are common indicators of supply chain attack vectors or malware. No obfuscation is present, but the malicious actions are embedded within setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data and executing a remotely downloaded file during package installation. It indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and poses a significant security risk.",
