{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package installation, with an additional post-installation process that involves sending data and downloading/executing a file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and download URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers, writing to a file, executing downloaded file via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "The 'send' function reads environment variable, makes a GET request to exfiltrate info, then downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; downloading and executing a remote executable; sending environment info to an external server; no validation or verification of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that includes a post-install step. During installation, it attempts to send the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to an external server. On Windows systems, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, including data exfiltration and remote code execution. The code structure hides these actions within the setup process, which is suspicious. No legitimate package setup would typically perform such actions. The code does not appear obfuscated but uses dynamic network and execution functions that pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution upon installation. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
