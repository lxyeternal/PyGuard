  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and system interaction, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. Despite the primary purpose being package setup, the surrounding logic suggests backdoor or malicious capabilities. It should be treated as suspicious or malicious until thoroughly analyzed and sanitized. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior and obfuscation level."
