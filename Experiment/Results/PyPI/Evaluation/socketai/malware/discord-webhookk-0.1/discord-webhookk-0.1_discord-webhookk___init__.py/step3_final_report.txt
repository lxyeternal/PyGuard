  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network functions, data processing routines, module imports, parameters, and external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, and data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and inputs flow into network requests, file writes, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The data flow from sources to sinks is typical for utility or data processing scripts. The absence of code snippets limits certainty, but based on available information, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to potential misuse of environment variables or network functions, but no evidence supports malicious intent. The overall assessment is that the package is safe, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a low security risk.",
