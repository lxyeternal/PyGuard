      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution and embedded suspicious URL. The setup script is likely a disguise for malicious activity, posing a high security threat. The assigned scores are justified and indicate a high probability of malicious intent, warranting removal or further investigation."
