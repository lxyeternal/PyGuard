{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package called 'selfsplitrandompyw' with specific metadata. It also contains obfuscated subprocess code that may be used to execute hidden commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment (checking for 'tahg' directory), and executes subprocess commands with encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes potentially malicious PowerShell encoded command, which could be used for malicious activities such as downloading, executing remote scripts, or other payloads.",
  "flows": "The code checks for a directory, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command if the directory does not exist, which could lead to executing malicious code on the system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command with encoded string, which is often used to conceal malicious activity. The URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') is suspicious. The subprocess call is hidden and may perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup function for a Python package, which is typical. However, it then tries to import subprocess and os modules, and checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If the directory does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. The encoded PowerShell command suggests potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The setup call is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may hide issues or malicious failures. The overall structure hints at hiding malicious activity behind legitimate package setup code. The URL and obfuscated command are significant red flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution that could be malicious. The setup code appears legitimate but is likely used as a cover for malicious behavior. The presence of encoded commands and a suspicious URL indicates a high risk of malicious intent.",
