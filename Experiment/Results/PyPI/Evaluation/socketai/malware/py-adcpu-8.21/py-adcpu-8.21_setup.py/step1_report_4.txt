{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package named 'py-adcpu', intended for distribution via PyPI, and includes some potentially malicious code that executes hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of a file 'tahg' from the filesystem; it also imports subprocess and os modules to execute external commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which may perform malicious activities; the package setup information is unrelated to the malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, executed without user consent, and the obfuscation of command details suggests malicious intent. The command runs with hidden window flags and is unlikely to be benign.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a specific file ('tahg') exists; if not, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window. The encoded command, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as system modification or data exfiltration. The setup() function appears normal, defining package metadata, but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors. This structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior while maintaining seemingly legitimate package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior via hidden execution of a PowerShell command, potentially for malicious activities such as backdoor installation or data theft. The malicious code is obfuscated and executed silently, indicating a high likelihood of sabotage or malware intent. The package appears to be used as a vector for supply chain attack.",
