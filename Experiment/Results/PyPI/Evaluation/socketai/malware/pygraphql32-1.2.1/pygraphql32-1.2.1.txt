      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The custom install class is a placeholder and does not introduce any current vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for future modifications but is justified given the current code. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent through remote code execution, proxy obfuscation, and persistent network activity. It should be classified as malicious with high malware and security risk scores. The pattern is typical of malware delivery mechanisms, warranting immediate caution and removal if encountered."
