{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pygraphql32', specifying dependencies and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and a custom install command class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage, remote command execution, or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies and executes the custom install class, but the class does not perform any additional actions.",
  "anomalies": "The CustomInstall class overrides the run method without adding any custom behavior; the email address appears suspiciously informal but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing setuptools, defining a custom install class that does nothing beyond calling the superclass method, and setting package metadata. No input sources (such as untrusted data) or sinks (such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications) are present. The dependencies are common libraries. The custom install class is a placeholder with no malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with standard packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a non-functional custom install class and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
