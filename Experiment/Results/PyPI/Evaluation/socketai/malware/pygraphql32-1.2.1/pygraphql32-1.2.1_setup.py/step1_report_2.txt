{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pygraphql32', specifying dependencies and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, description, author info), dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code executing untrusted data or performing external communications.",
  "flows": "No complex data flow; primarily static metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The CustomInstall class redefines run() but does not add any behavior, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious imports or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, with a minimal custom install class that performs default behavior. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. Dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and benign. It configures package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
