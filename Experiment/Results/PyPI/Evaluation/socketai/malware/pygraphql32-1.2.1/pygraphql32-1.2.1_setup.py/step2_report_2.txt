  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup.py with a custom install class that only calls the superclass method. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. The high confidence is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the setup script with a minimal custom install class. No suspicious code or external communications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no issues found.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard setup script with no malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code; benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with a note that the custom install class does nothing malicious. Slightly higher securityRisk=0.1, possibly due to the placeholder nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low securityRisk score seems reasonable given the minimal setup, but the lack of actual malicious behavior supports a zero malware score.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup with a non-functional custom install class. The informal email is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with a custom install class that does nothing suspicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the placeholder class, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence across all reports, justified by the straightforward code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate. The slight increase to 0.1 in some reports appears unwarranted since no actual risk exists.\n\n### Overall:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a standard, harmless setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
