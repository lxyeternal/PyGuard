  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with a custom install class.",
  "sources": "Package metadata, dependencies list, and the custom install class definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communications or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The custom install class's run method calls the superclass without additional actions; no malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The CustomInstall class is a placeholder that does nothing, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with a minimal custom install class that only invokes the default behavior. Dependencies are common packages with no suspicious patterns. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The custom class does not perform any malicious actions or modifications. The email address is informal but not malicious. The overall structure is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The custom install class is a placeholder and does not introduce any current vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for future modifications but is justified given the current code. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
