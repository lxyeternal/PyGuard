  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pygraphql32' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters and import statements, notably 'install_requires' dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions identified in this code.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from the package metadata and dependencies to the installation process, with no data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The CustomInstall class does not perform any additional actions beyond the default run method.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a custom install command class that simply calls the superclass method. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and the custom install class. All dependencies listed are common Python packages. The CustomInstall class does not contain any malicious or suspicious code; it merely invokes the standard install process. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, file manipulation, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The custom install class does not perform any malicious actions, and the dependencies are standard packages. Overall, it appears safe.",
