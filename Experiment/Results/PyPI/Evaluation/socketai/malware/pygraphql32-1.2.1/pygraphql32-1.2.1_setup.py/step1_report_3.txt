{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration including dependencies and a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version, description, author info) and dependencies list; no external data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any untrusted data handling, network communication, or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The CustomInstall class overrides the run method but does not add any custom behavior or malicious code; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It specifies package information and dependencies. The custom install class does not perform any extra actions beyond calling the parent run method. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No external data inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies are common Python packages. The overall structure is standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies with a minimal custom install class that does not introduce any suspicious behavior.",
