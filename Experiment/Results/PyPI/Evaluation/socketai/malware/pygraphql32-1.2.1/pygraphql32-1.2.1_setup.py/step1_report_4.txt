  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pygraphql32', including dependencies and a custom install command.",
  "sources": "Data read from setup arguments, package configuration, and dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "Installation process that could potentially execute code during install, but currently no explicit code execution or data flow leading to malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The setup process flows from package configuration to installation commands, with no data or input flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors detected. The custom install class does not perform any additional actions beyond calling the superclass method.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up package metadata, dependencies, and a custom install class that currently does nothing beyond invoking the standard install process. No suspicious code, data leaks, network activity, or backdoors are present. The custom class may be a placeholder for future modifications but does not exhibit malicious intent as-is.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not perform any suspicious operations or contain malicious payloads.",
