  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module1 package, likely to extend or utilize its functionality in the current package.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or external data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network, or system effect points are evident in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow is observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports all contents from a local module1. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external data reads, or potentially dangerous behaviors. The import statement uses a relative import which is common in packages, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The version string is standard for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets a version and imports a module.",
