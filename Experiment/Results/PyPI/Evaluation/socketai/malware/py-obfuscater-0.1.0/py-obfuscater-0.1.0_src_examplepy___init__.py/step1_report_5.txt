{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the version of a Python package and imports all contents from a local module named 'module1'.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .module1 import *' reads data from the 'module1' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows could originate from 'module1' and propagate through imported functions or variables; however, no explicit sinks like network calls or file writes are present here.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink flows are evident in this snippet, as it only imports content from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to lack of clarity, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports everything from a local module. It is minimal, with no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The absence of network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution suggests low risk. The use of 'import *' could be considered a code smell but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple and standard for Python packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or anomalies are detected.",
