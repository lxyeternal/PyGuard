{
  "purpose": "The code sets the version of the package and imports all contents from a local module named module1.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module1 imports code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or untrusted data handling in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present; the import may bring in code but no data flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version string and performs a local import. It does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs, external data handling, or obfuscation. The import is from a local module, which is standard practice. Without additional context from module1, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets a version and imports a local module, which is common in Python package structure.",
