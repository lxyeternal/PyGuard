{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories. It also includes functionality to zip and upload collected data to external file hosting services, indicating data theft and espionage intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local browser storage files (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord local files, login databases, cookies, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. Data is read from encrypted storage files, log files, and directories on the system.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include requests to exfiltration webhooks (Discord webhook URL hardcoded), uploads to file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), and execution of subprocess commands (e.g., taskkill). Extracted tokens and decrypted credentials are sent over network requests for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (browser files, Discord files, user directories) where credentials, tokens, cookies, and files are read. These are decrypted and processed (e.g., decrypting passwords, decoding tokens). Collected data is then prepared and sent via HTTP POST requests to external webhook URLs and file hosting services. Zipping functions package files for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscation-like behaviors such as dynamic thread spawning, dynamic zip creation, and multiple network requests with suppressed exceptions. Hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious. The code dynamically installs requests and pycryptodome modules if missing. The script kills processes (e.g., browser or wallet apps) during file access. Use of regex for token extraction and decryption of data from browser files indicates malicious data extraction intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a data-stealing malware targeting browser credentials, Discord tokens, cookies, and files from specific directories. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs and AES, then exfiltrates sensitive data to a remote webhook. It also compresses and uploads files from user directories, indicating data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, process termination commands, and broad system access further confirm malicious intent. The code's structure, including thread management and dynamic module installation, suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure persistence. Overall, the code's purpose is to covertly harvest personal data and send it to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for large-scale data theft from browsers, applications, and user directories. It exfiltrates sensitive data to external servers and includes techniques to hide its intent. It poses a significant security threat and should be considered malicious malware, with a very high security risk score.",
