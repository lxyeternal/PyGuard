{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer, extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browser and application data stores, decrypting sensitive information, and exfiltrating this data via a Discord webhook and file uploads to external servers. It employs techniques such as dynamic module installation, decryption routines, multi-threading, and process termination to evade detection and maximize data collection.",
  "sources": "It reads input data from browser storage directories (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Yandex, Opera), log files (.log, .ldb), local SQLite databases (e.g., Login Data), Discord local storage, Steam files, application directories (e.g., NKB extension, Riot Client), and environment variables (USERNAME, APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA). It also captures data from local system files and in-memory regex matches.",
  "sinks": "The script exfiltrates data by sending HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, uploads files to external hosting services (gofile.io), and writes data to temporary files. It also executes subprocess commands to terminate processes and manipulates files for zipping and uploading, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage and log files (sources), then decrypted using Windows DPAPI and AES routines. Extracted tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are compiled, then transmitted via network requests to the webhook and uploaded to external servers. The process involves multiple threads for parallel data collection, process termination commands during zipping, and file handling routines for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, dynamic module installation via subprocess pip calls, use of Windows API decryption routines, process termination commands (taskkill), threading for concurrent data collection, and a suspicious 'setuptools.setup()' call at the end. The code also employs some regex-based obfuscation and minimal code comments, indicating attempts at concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically targets various data sources related to user credentials, tokens, and personal files. It decrypts stored data using Windows APIs, extracts tokens via regex patterns, and exfiltrates the data through HTTP requests and file uploads. The use of threading enhances collection speed, while process termination commands help evade detection during file zipping. The hardcoded webhook URL and the setup() call are suspicious artifacts, likely intended to disguise or repurpose the script. Overall, the script exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent, including extensive data theft, external exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a high-severity malicious malware designed for comprehensive data theft and exfiltration. It employs multiple techniques to gather sensitive user information from browsers, applications, and system files, then exfiltrates this data via external webhooks and hosting services. The presence of suspicious artifacts like hardcoded URLs and setup() suggests obfuscation or an attempt to disguise malicious activity. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is justified as 1.",
