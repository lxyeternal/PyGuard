{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious stealer designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications, then upload and share the data via webhooks and anonymous file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Sources include local browser storage, login data, cookies, Discord API endpoints, Steam configuration directories, and user document folders. Notably, it reads from browser levelDB files, Local State files, log and ldb files, and specific application directories.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over the network to a Discord webhook and uploaded to anonymous file hosting services. It also writes data to local files in TEMP directories. Potential sinks include requests to Discord, file uploads to gofile.io, and local file writes.",
  "flows": "The code collects tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from specified paths, decrypts encrypted data using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) and master keys, then uploads the gathered information via network requests. Data flows from local storage to decryption functions, then to exfiltration endpoints, including webhook and file upload services.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, suspicious function names, use of threading for parallel operations, and extensive use of decryption routines to extract encrypted data. It dynamically installs dependencies without user consent. The presence of obfuscation-like behavior, such as dynamic path generation and reading various sensitive files, raises suspicion. Also, the setup function at the end is repurposed from a package setup script, which is unusual for malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive stealer designed to gather sensitive user information from browsers, Discord, Steam, and other apps. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows DPAPI and master keys, collects tokens from log and ldb files, and retrieves various user data like email, phone, badges, billing info, friends list, and more. The code exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook and uploads files to an anonymous hosting service. It also features multi-threaded execution to maximize data collection speed. The obfuscation is minimal but the code is intentionally hidden within a setup-like call at the end, which is suspicious. The dependencies are installed dynamically, and it performs cleanup and file operations stealthily. Overall, this code exhibits multiple signs of malicious intent and could cause significant privacy breaches if executed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a malicious data stealer targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and other personal information. It exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services, operating stealthily with multi-threading and decryption routines. It is highly dangerous and should be blocked and removed from any environment where it is detected.",
