  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a high-severity malicious malware designed for comprehensive data theft and exfiltration. It employs multiple techniques to gather sensitive user information from browsers, applications, and system files, then exfiltrates this data via external webhooks and hosting services. The presence of suspicious artifacts like hardcoded URLs and setup() suggests obfuscation or an attempt to disguise malicious activity. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is justified as 1."
