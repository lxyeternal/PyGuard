{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from a victim's system, and exfiltrate this data to a remote webhook and file hosting service. It also performs various file and data collection operations for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (logins, cookies, local state), in-memory data (regex extraction), user input, and network responses (geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Uploads data to remote webhooks and file hosting services, executes subprocesses (e.g., taskkill, pip install), writes files locally, and calls functions to exfiltrate captured data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as local system data, tokens, cookies, passwords, and files are collected, processed, and then sent via HTTP POST requests to webhook URLs and upload functions; network requests also fetch system info and victim geolocation; system commands terminate processes and manage files.",
  "anomalies": "Contains code for token, password, cookie, and file stealing; dynamically installs missing dependencies; uses obfuscated/complex regex patterns for token extraction; executes system commands like 'taskkill'; uploads data to external services without user consent; contains unencrypted webhook URL hardcoded at the start; includes a final setup call for a package unrelated to the main malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The script actively searches for browser data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and local files, then decodes and uploads this information to a remote webhook, indicating malicious intent. It also collects system information, geolocation, and Discord relationships, potentially for identification or further exploitation. The code employs dynamic dependency installation, system process termination, and file zipping for exfiltration. It has embedded functions for handling various data types and reporting, all aligned with data theft behavior. The final setup call appears unrelated and might be an attempt to mask or repurpose the script. Overall, the script exhibits typical characteristics of malware designed for data theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior aimed at extracting sensitive user data, system information, and files, then exfiltrating it to external servers. Its structure, data collection techniques, and network interactions confirm its purpose as a malicious information stealer, fitting malware activity criteria.",
