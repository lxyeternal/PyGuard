  "sources": "import statements for unittest and examplepy.module1.Number",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the test case simply performs an addition operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code imports a unit testing framework and a class 'Number' from a module. It defines a test case that adds two Number instances and asserts their sum. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No external data sources or sinks are used. The test merely verifies an addition operation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for testing the functionality of the Number class.",
