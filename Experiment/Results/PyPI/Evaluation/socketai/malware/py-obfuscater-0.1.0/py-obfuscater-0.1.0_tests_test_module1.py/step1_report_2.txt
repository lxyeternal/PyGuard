{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple unit test for the 'Number' class from 'examplepy.module1', testing the addition operation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a class and runs a test case.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the test operates on hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a straightforward unit test, and runs it. It does not include any data input/output, network activity, or code execution beyond standard testing. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The 'Number' class is imported from an external module, but its implementation is unknown; based on the visible code, no malicious behavior is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign unit test code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
