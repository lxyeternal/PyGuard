  "purpose": "A simple Python unit test verifying addition functionality of the Number class from an external module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input values (5 and 6) within the test case.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input values are used directly in the test; no external data flows or untrusted data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that imports a class from an external module and tests addition. It involves no external input, network activity, or data leaks. The implementation appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external dependency 'examplepy.module1' is not inherently suspicious, and the test's simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's nature. No evidence suggests malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
