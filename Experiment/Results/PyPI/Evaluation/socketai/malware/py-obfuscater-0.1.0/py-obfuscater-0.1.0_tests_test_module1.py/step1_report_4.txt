  "purpose": "This code defines a unit test for the Number class in the examplepy.module1 module, verifying the addition operation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'unittest' and 'Number' class from 'examplepy.module1'; test method reading test input data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (test numbers) flows through the Number class and the unittest framework; no external sink is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No obfuscated or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports standard testing library and a class from a module, then runs a simple addition test on the Number class. The test checks if adding Number(5) and Number(6) yields a value of 11. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a standard unit test with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal unit test for a class, with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious elements detected.",
