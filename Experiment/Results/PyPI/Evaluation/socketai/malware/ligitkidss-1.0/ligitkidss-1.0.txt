      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent by fetching and executing remote code during package setup, representing a severe security risk. The behavior aligns with remote code execution attacks, warranting classification as malware. The scores should reflect maximum threat levels, with malware and security risk scores at 1, and obfuscation at a moderate level (~0.6) due to obfuscated variable names but not heavy encryption or code hiding."
