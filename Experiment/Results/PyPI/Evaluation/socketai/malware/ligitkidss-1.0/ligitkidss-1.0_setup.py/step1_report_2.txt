{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'ligitkidss' and attempts to execute a temporary script that fetches and executes code from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "Reading the package setup parameters, creating and writing to a temporary file, reading from the temporary file, and executing system commands to run the temporary script.",
  "sinks": "System command execution via _ssystem to run the temporary file, which contains code fetched from the internet and executed via exec.",
  "flows": "Temporary file is created and written with code that downloads and executes remote content; then the system command runs this temporary file, executing the remote code in the current process.",
  "anomalies": "The code creates a temporary file that contains code to fetch and execute content from a remote URL, which is highly suspicious. The use of try-except around system call suppresses errors, which could hide malicious activity. The remote URL may deliver malicious payloads, and the temporary file acts as a conduit for executing potentially harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules for package setup, temporary file creation, system commands, and executable paths. It then creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that fetches content from a remote URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw') and executes it via exec. The temporary file is closed, then the system command attempts to run this file, passing the path to an executable with a slight modification. The code to execute remote content is embedded directly in the temporary script, which is launched via the system shell. The package setup is standard but is overshadowed by the malicious activity of remote code fetching and execution, which poses a significant security risk. This pattern indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution or malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern where it downloads and executes remote code, representing a high security threat. The package setup is a facade for executing malicious payloads at runtime. Overall, this code is malicious with high confidence.",
