{
  "purpose": "To define and set up a Python package named 'ligitkidss' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the temporary file created (_ttmp), which contains a URL request and exec call. It also reads the system executable path (_eexecutable).",
  "sinks": "The code executes a system command that runs a file, which is created temporarily and contains code that fetches and executes remote code from a URL.",
  "flows": "The temporary file (_ttmp) is written with code that fetches and executes remote content. The system command runs an executable (potentially malicious) that is named based on the current Python executable, with the temporary file as an argument.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates a temporary file containing code that fetches remote content and executes it, then runs it via system call. The URL points to a pastebin-like URL, and the code execution occurs without validation. The use of try-except without error handling masks potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a temporary file with Python code that fetches data from an external URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw') and executes it. It then attempts to run this temporary file with a system command, modifying the current Python executable name to create the filename. This process indicates dynamic code execution originating from remote content, which is suspicious. The setup() function is typical, but the preceding malicious code raises serious concerns. The code is designed to run arbitrary remote code during installation, which is a common behavior in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during setup, indicating a high risk of supply chain compromise. The dynamic execution of remote content and system calls to run external code are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
