{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be setting up a Python package named 'ligitkidss' with some associated metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a temporary file (_ttmp) which contains a URL request that fetches and executes remote code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes code downloaded from the remote URL, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file, then attempts to run that file using the system shell. The script downloads and executes external code from 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw'.",
  "anomalies": "The temporary file contains obfuscated code that downloads and executes remote content. The code attempts to execute this content automatically. The use of system() to start an executable with the temporary file indicates potentially malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and creates a temporary file that stores a snippet which fetches and executes code from a remote URL. It then attempts to execute this file with a system call. This behavior indicates remote code execution, a common tactic in supply chain attacks or malware. The setup() call itself appears benign, but the earlier code is suspicious due to remote code execution and obfuscation. The URL points to an external resource that is automatically fetched and executed, which is highly risky. The try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious failures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code without any validation or user consent. The remote code execution mechanism indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or a backdoor. The setup function is standard, but the surrounding code is suspicious.",
