{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package called 'ligitkidss' using setuptools, with an additional process that downloads and executes external code, and attempts to run a temporary file, possibly to execute remote content.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL via urlopen, writes to a temporary file, and executes system commands to run the temporary file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands with _ssystem to run a file, execution of code fetched from a URL, and potential file execution from the temporary file.",
  "flows": "urlopen fetches remote code -> writes to temporary file -> _ssystem executes temporary file -> the temporary file executes potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes writing and executing code fetched from an external URL, creating a temporary file, and attempting to run a modified executable. The URL points to a raw pastebin-like site, which is suspicious. The use of try-except without logging or error handling also indicates obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from setuptools for package installation, but immediately creates a temporary file containing Python code that fetches and executes remote content. It then attempts to run this file using the system shell, which could execute arbitrary, malicious code. The URL used is external and not controlled within the code, indicating a possible command-and-control or malicious payload. The approach of dynamically fetching and executing remote code is a common tactic in malicious scripts, and the lack of any validation or sandboxing further raises concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code, likely aiming to run malicious payloads on the host system. The use of external URLs, dynamic code execution, and system commands indicate high risk.",
