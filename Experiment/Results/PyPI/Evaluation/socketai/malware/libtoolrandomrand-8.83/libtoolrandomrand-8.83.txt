      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily due to obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during setup, external URL involvement, and concealment tactics. The assigned scores (malware 0.85, obfuscation 0.9, security risk 0.9) are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious until further decoding confirms its payload. Overall, the package poses a significant security threat and warrants caution or removal."
