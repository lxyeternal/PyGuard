{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package and execute potentially malicious code by retrieving and running a remote script.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA), URL request to download remote script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file via subprocess.Popen, os.system, and os.system(\"gamer.bat\") commands, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Download from remote URL to APPDATA\\gamer.bat -> execute the downloaded script via subprocess.Popen and os.system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes fetching a script from a suspicious URL, executing it silently, and using environment variables to obscure file paths. The URL is not a legitimate package source. The code does not verify the downloaded content, nor does it restrict or sanitize execution.",
  "analysis": "The script initially sets up package metadata, then attempts to import standard libraries. The critical part involves retrieving a script from an external URL ('https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr') and saving it as 'gamer.bat' in the APPDATA directory. It then runs this script silently using subprocess.Popen with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, waits, copies the script, and executes it again with os.system. These steps strongly suggest malicious intent, as they involve downloading and executing code from an untrusted source without validation. The code leverages environment variables to hide its operations. Overall, this pattern is typical of malicious payload delivery and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing remote code without verification, indicative of a potential backdoor or remote control mechanism. The initial setup and package configuration are benign, but the post-setup code is malicious and highly suspicious.",
