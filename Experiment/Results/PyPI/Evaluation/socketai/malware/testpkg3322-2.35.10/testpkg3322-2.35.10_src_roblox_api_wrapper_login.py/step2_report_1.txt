  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets are placeholder functions with no implementation.\n- They accept parameters that could be sensitive (cookie, username, password).\n- They do not perform any operations, network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious activities are present.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, incomplete, or a stub.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the functions are empty placeholders with no operational logic.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there flaws?**  \n  No. The reports accurately describe the code's state and do not overstate or understate potential risks.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is correct since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Mostly `0` or very low (`0.1`), which aligns with the fact that the code is non-functional and does not leak data or perform risky operations.\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5:\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is correct. The code is benign and incomplete.\n\n### Potential Claims and Assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the functions *could* be placeholders or incomplete, but no assumptions of malicious intent are made.\n- No suspicious behavior is inferred beyond the fact that the functions are unimplemented.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and the content of the reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close, e.g., 0.1, due to parameter sensitivity, but still negligible)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- If these functions were to be completed with actual login logic, security considerations would then become relevant.\n- As they stand, they are simply skeletons with no malicious or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is harmless, incomplete, and contains no malicious activity.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- No score adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is benign in its current state.",
