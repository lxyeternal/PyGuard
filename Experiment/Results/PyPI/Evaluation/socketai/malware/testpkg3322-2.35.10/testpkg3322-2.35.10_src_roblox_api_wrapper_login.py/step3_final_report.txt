  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API interactions",
  "sources": "Function parameters: cookie, username, password",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not process or transmit data",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two stub functions accepting parameters that could be sensitive but do nothing. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. The functions are placeholders, likely for future implementation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or security issues. The parameters are unused, and the functions do not perform any operations, network calls, or data processing. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any suspicious features or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, incomplete, and contains no malicious activity or security risks. The functions are simple placeholders with no operational logic, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
