{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox API login, currently not implemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' that could potentially contain user input or sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "No active code; functions do not perform any actions, so no data flow or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data flow as functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two login functions for Roblox with descriptive names but no actual logic. The functions accept sensitive inputs (cookie, username, password) but do nothing. There is no malware, malicious behavior, or security risk present in the code. The absence of implementation may suggest incomplete development but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of stub functions with no operational content. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears incomplete rather than malicious.",
