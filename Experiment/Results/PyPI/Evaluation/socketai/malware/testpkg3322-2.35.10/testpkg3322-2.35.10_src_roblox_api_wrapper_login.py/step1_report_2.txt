{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login to roblox.com API, but currently do not perform any operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as functions do not perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur since functions are empty and do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual and suspicious in context; could be placeholders or intentionally incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for login purposes but does not implement any logic. The functions do not process input data, perform network requests, or execute any operations. The absence of actual login code may suggest an incomplete implementation or a potential placeholder for malicious code insertion, but as it stands, there is no malicious behavior. No data handling, no external calls, and no suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is trivial, containing only placeholder functions without any operational logic. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code snippet.",
