{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to implement login functions for Roblox API, one using cookies and the other using username and password.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' provided to the functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; functions currently do nothing, so untrusted data is not processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows since the functions are empty; no data is processed or passed along.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual for operational code. Lack of implementation could indicate incomplete development or deliberate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two login functions with parameters but does not perform any actions. The absence of logic means there's no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior in the current state. The structure suggests a placeholder or stub code. No external calls, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. This makes it impossible to identify malicious intent or security risks based solely on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no operational or malicious code. It currently presents no security risk or malware potential. Its lack of implementation is the primary notable feature, indicating it is incomplete or a stub.",
