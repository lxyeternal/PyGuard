  "anomalies": "Functions are empty; no actual implementation or data handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder functions meant for login processes but lacks implementation. There are no data reads, no data processing, and no external communications. The functions currently do nothing and do not perform any malicious actions or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and non-functional; it poses no security threats or malware risks in its current form. It appears to be a stub or skeleton for future development, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
