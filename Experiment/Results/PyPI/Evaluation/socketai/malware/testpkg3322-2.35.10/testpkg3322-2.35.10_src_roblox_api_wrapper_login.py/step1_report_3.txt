  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for user authentication to the Roblox API, likely for login purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "None present; functions are empty and do not process or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, no secrets, no unusual code, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for login actions but neither contains any executable logic. There are no data inputs processed, no data leaks, no suspicious behaviors, or malicious code embedded. The functions are placeholders, which could be part of a larger codebase, but in isolation, there is no malicious activity. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely boilerplate with no implemented logic. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious activity observed. It appears to be a stub or template for future development.",
