{
  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "The 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' parameters passed to the send function",
  "sinks": "Potentially where the message data is processed or transmitted, though implementation is missing",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are passed into the function, but no processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; no data processing, no network calls, no code execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with parameters for user, recipient, and message, but the body is empty ('pass'). This means the function does nothing when called. There are no data flows, no inputs processed, and no outputs or side effects. The absence of implementation could be intentional, or it could be a stub for future code. Since no data handling or external interactions are present, there are no security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder function with no active logic. It does not perform any actions, does not process data, and poses no security risk or malicious intent. It appears to be a stub intended for future implementation.",
