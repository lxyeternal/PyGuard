{
  "purpose": "A placeholder function intended to send messages between users, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as inputs; no data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond the function definition; the function does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple stub with no logic, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with parameters but contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating it is a placeholder with no implementation. There are no data processing, network activity, or malicious behaviors present. The code's simplicity and lack of logic mean there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as a stub with no active behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's state. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the straightforward nature of the code and the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, unimplemented placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
