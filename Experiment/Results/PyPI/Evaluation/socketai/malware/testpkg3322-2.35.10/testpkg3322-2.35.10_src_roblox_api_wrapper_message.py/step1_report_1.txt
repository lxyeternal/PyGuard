  "purpose": "Function to send a message from a User object to a recipient",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' passed into the function",
  "sinks": "Potentially where the message is processed or transmitted within the 'send' function",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters to the message transmission process (not shown, as the function is a stub)",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; no code execution, data handling, or network activity present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function intended to handle message sending between users. The function is currently a placeholder with no implementation, thus no data processing, transmission, or side effects occur. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code is evident. The absence of implementation means there is no malicious activity or security concern within this snippet. The code appears to be incomplete or a stub.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a placeholder function with no actual logic, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies in this minimal stub.",
