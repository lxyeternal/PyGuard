{
  "purpose": "The function 'send' is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message', which are inputs to the function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in the code; the function body is empty and does not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within the function, as it is currently unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a placeholder with no implementation, no input validation, and no actual data handling or transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'send' function with three parameters but contains no logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or insecure practices. The lack of implementation suggests it is either incomplete or a stub. No source-to-sink data flows or suspicious operations are present. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder function with no implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies. It appears to be a stub intended for future development.",
