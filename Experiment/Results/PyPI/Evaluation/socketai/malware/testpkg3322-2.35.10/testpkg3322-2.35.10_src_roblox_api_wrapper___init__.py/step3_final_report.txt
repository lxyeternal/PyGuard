  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic code execution (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, environment variables, file I/O, network connections, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, system modifications, network communications, or unsafe data handling functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into code execution or data transmission sinks, possibly via obfuscated or dynamic code segments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, or unusual data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is evaluated for suspicious patterns, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, and network activity. Benign code shows straightforward logic without obfuscation or secrets. Malicious indicators include eval/exec, obfuscation, secrets, or network connections to suspicious domains. The scores are assigned based on these signals, with high malware (0.75) and obfuscation (0.7) justified if such patterns are confirmed. Benign code receives low scores (0), with low security risk (0.2). The overall assessment aligns with the presence or absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with scores reflecting low malware and obfuscation levels. Report 2 indicates suspicious patterns, justifying high scores. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable, with cautious attention warranted for code exhibiting eval/exec or obfuscation.",
