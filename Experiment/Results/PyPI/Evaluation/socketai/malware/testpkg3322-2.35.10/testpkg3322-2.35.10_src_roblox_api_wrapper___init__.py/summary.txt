  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with scores reflecting low malware and obfuscation levels. Report 2 indicates suspicious patterns, justifying high scores. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable, with cautious attention warranted for code exhibiting eval/exec or obfuscation."
