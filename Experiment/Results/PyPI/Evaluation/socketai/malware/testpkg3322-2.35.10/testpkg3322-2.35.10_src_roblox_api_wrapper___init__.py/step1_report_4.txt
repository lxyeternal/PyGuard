  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or utility function.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input, and possibly file reads or network sources (if present in the omitted parts).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network communication functions, file writes, or database operations (if used).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like system commands or network endpoints, passing through processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident. Unusual features such as dynamic code execution or obfuscated code are absent. No apparent backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard usage of Python features. No malicious behavior or suspicious activities are observable. All third-party libraries used are common and do not exhibit malicious intent. The structure and format are normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators. Without additional context or hidden code, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility or data processing script with no evident security threats.",
