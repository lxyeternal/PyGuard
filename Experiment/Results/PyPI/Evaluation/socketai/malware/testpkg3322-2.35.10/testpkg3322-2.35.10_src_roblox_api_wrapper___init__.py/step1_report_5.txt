  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports modules, and possibly reads files or network data (if present). No explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, or data storage functions if present. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows are observable within the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are apparent. The code structure appears straightforward, with no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at all parts, including the beginning, middle, and end. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious network activity was detected. Usage of libraries appears standard. No anomalies like hidden code or obfuscation are present. The code's intent seems benign based on the available content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious utility script.",
