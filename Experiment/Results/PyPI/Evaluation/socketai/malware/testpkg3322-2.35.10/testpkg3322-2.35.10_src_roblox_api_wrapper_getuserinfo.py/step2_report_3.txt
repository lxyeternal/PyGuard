  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is incomplete, with an empty function body (`pass`).\n- The import of `requests` is unused in all snippets, which is noted as potentially indicative of incomplete implementation.\n- No actual data flows, network requests, or malicious behaviors are present in the provided code.\n- The code appears to be a placeholder or stub, not actively performing any operations.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Function to retrieve user info.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no active data flow, network request, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the code's benign state. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a stub with no implementation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the scores align with the code's state.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with mention of potential external API.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of implementation and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence, but still appropriate given the code. The security risk is minimal, reflecting the placeholder nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same, with emphasis on potential network communication.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no actual request is made, so no data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with mention of future external API interaction.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a placeholder.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1) for most, reflecting the incomplete, benign nature of the code. Slightly higher confidence levels (up to 0.9) are justified based on the mention of external requests, but no actual risk exists currently.\n- **Sources, sinks, flows:** All correctly identified as absent or placeholders.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Overall, the scores are consistent and reasonable given the code. No changes needed.\n- **Additional notes:** The presence of the `requests` import in an unimplemented function is not malicious but could suggest future external data retrieval. Still, as it stands, no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to incomplete code and unused imports)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's current state.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, incomplete, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
