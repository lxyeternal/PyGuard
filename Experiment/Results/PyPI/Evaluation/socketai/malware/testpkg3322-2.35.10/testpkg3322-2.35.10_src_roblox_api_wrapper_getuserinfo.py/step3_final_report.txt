  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to retrieve user information, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'user', import of 'requests' library",
  "sinks": "None in current code",
  "flows": "No data flows; function contains only 'pass'",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'requests', empty function body, incomplete implementation",
  "analysis": "The code is a stub with no active logic, network requests, or data processing. The 'requests' import is unused, indicating incomplete development. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, incomplete state of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, incomplete, and shows no signs of malware or obfuscation. The current scores accurately reflect its state. No adjustments are necessary.",
