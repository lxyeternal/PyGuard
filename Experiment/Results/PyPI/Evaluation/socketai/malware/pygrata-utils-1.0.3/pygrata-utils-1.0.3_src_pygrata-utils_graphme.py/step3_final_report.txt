  "purpose": "Minimal Python code importing the standard library 'os' with no additional logic.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import os' as the only source of data or input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import of a standard library module with a comment. No functions, data processing, or execution occurs. The import of 'os' is common and not suspicious. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The minimal nature of the code indicates it is benign. All reports correctly assess the code as harmless, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action is necessary.",
