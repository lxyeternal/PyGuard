{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code snippets, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data processing functions, network or file interactions, input/output points, external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system writes, environment variable access, data transmission points, potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into processing functions, which may lead to network communication or data storage points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; limited context suggests benign behavior.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify missing or benign code, assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores. The low security risk scores (~0.2) are conservative but justified given the lack of suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and zero where code is absent. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent across reports, with appropriate caution reflected in the scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Overall, the supply chain security risk for these dependencies is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
