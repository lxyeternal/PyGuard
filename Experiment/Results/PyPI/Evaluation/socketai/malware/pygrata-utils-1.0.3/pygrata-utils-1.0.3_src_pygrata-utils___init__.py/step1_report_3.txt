{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or files.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include user input via function arguments, environment variables, or file reads. Specific source points are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls that could send data externally or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions, possibly reaching network or file output points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated sections are identified. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with typical data processing steps. No indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity, are present. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The structure and content suggest a legitimate purpose without obfuscation or malware traits.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script for data handling.",
