  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, reconnaissance, and covert communication via DNS. It encodes sensitive data to evade detection and uploads it to external servers. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the activity should be considered malicious and dangerous for deployment."
