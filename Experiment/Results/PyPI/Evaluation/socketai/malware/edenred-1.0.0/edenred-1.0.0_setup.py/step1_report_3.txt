{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()), triggered during the install command execution.",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external URL ('https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun') with system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the 'params' of requests.get(), resulting in the transmission of potentially sensitive system data to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: the custom install class collects system info and exfiltrates it without user consent or notification. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious, with a non-standard domain and obfuscated structure. The code executes network requests during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard installation process, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then immediately sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior can be used to spy on the user's environment without consent, indicating malicious intent. The use of requests in this manner during package installation is suspicious and atypical for legitimate packages. The URL looks suspicious and potentially malicious, likely used for data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation. The exfiltration occurs silently and without user knowledge, indicating a supply chain attack vector aimed at spying or data theft. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious.",
