{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to silently collect system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrate it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) pass data directly into requests.get() parameters",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during installation without user notification or consent; use of a suspicious, non-legitimate URL; no obfuscation or encryption; straightforward code",
  "analysis": "The code performs data collection of system info during package installation and exfiltrates this info to an external server without user awareness. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, and does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors beyond data exfiltration. The high suspicion scores in the reports are justified due to the privacy invasion and potential malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, making the package potentially dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: approximately 0.85, security risk: approximately 0.9, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information silently during installation to a suspicious URL, indicating high potential for privacy invasion and malicious tracking. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code is straightforward but suspicious, warranting caution and further investigation. The package should be flagged or removed from distribution until verified safe.",
