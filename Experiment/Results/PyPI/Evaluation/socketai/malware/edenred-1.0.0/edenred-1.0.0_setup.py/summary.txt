  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information silently during installation to a suspicious URL, indicating high potential for privacy invasion and malicious tracking. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code is straightforward but suspicious, warranting caution and further investigation. The package should be flagged or removed from distribution until verified safe."
