{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username sources are sent directly to an external server in the run method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request with system information during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The domain used for the request appears suspicious and untrusted. The data exfiltration occurs automatically as part of package installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related functions and system modules. It overrides the install command to include additional actions during installation. The overridden run method collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to a suspicious domain. No validation, encryption, or user notification occurs. This behavior indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious tracking during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data to an external domain without user consent, representing a supply chain security risk. The code's intent appears malicious or at least highly suspicious due to automatic data transmission to an untrusted server.",
