{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package named 'edenred' with a custom install process that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL with system data as parameters",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> request parameters -> requests.get() call to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of collecting system info and sending it silently to an external domain during installation; no user consent or obvious purpose; the URL appears suspicious and non-standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends these details via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The request occurs automatically during package installation without explicit user approval, which indicates potential privacy invasion. The URL domain is non-standard and may be malicious. No other malicious activities or obfuscation are present. The data collection and transmission are hidden in the install process, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation to an external server, likely for tracking or malicious purposes. The URL and silent operation are red flags. This package should be considered malicious or security-risky.",
