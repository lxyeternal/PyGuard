  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment",
  "sinks": "Sends collected environment data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation",
  "flows": "Data collected from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows to the requests.get call, which transmits it externally",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an external URL without user consent; no apparent legitimate reason for this behavior",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, after executing the standard installation process, collects system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL, potentially for tracking or data collection purposes. The use of the requests library for external communication during install is suspicious. No other malicious code, such as payload execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, is present. The external URL appears suspicious and is not associated with legitimate package functionality. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent for tracking or data harvesting during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating user system information during package installation without user consent. This is suspicious and likely malicious.",
