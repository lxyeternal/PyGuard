  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during installation.",
  "sinks": "Requests library makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL with collected system data as parameters.",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the requests.get call as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an external server during installation without user consent. No validation or user notification occurs. The URL used is suspicious and looks obfuscated, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain. The use of requests in the install process to transmit environment information without disclosure suggests malicious intent. No code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or encryption is present, but the silent exfiltration is suspicious. The URL appears intentionally obfuscated, likely to hide malicious activity. This pattern could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or data theft during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious action by silently transmitting system information to an external domain during package installation, indicating a likely security risk. The behavior suggests tracking or data exfiltration without user consent.",
