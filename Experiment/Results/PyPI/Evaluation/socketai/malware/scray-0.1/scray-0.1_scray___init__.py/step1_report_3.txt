  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without further context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from user input functions, environment variables, or external modules (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Possible data outputs or network connections if the code interacts with external systems, but no explicit sinks identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input/env vars) to internal processing functions; no explicit source-to-sink data flows are observable in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is ambiguous but seems to involve routine data manipulation or utility functions. No malicious behavior, suspicious code patterns, or security issues are evident. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Given the lack of network activity, credential handling, or backdoors, the risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious behaviors identified. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
