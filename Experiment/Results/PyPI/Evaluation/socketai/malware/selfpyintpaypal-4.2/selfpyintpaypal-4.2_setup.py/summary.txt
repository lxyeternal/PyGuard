  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command with a suspicious URL, strongly indicating malicious activity. The setup script appears benign but is likely used as a cover. The high scores assigned are appropriate and reflect a high threat level. It should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms benign intent."
