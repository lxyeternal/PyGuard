{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration for 'selfpyintpaypal' and execute a hidden PowerShell command if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg'), subprocess.Popen (PowerShell command)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes a potentially malicious PowerShell command, os.path.exists reads the filesystem",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists → if not, run PowerShell command (potentially malicious)",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and runs without user consent; the use of try/except blocks suppress errors; no license specified; the PowerShell command appears obfuscated and could perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to check for the existence of the 'tahg' directory. If absent, it runs a subprocess executing an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style, which is suspicious. The command is encoded in base64 and is likely designed to hide its true purpose, indicating potential malicious intent. The setup() call for packaging appears benign but is wrapped in a try/except block, suppressing errors. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present. The encoded PowerShell command warrants suspicion due to its obfuscation and silent execution, typical of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated and silent execution of a PowerShell command that could be malicious. The setup process itself seems normal but is less relevant. The presence of hidden command execution and obfuscation suggests malicious behavior with high confidence, indicating a security risk.",
