  "conclusion": "The code pattern of obfuscated execution during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious. The current payload is benign, but the mechanism itself warrants caution. Scores should reflect moderate malware risk (~0.5-0.6), high obfuscation (~0.9), and significant security concern (~0.75)."
