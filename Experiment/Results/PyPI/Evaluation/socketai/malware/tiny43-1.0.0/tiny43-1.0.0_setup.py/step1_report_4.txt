{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process that includes malicious behavior by executing hidden code during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system().",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded shell command, potentially executing arbitrary commands.",
  "flows": "The function notmalfunc() is called during the install process, decoding base64 string to execute 'echo hola que tal > trule.txt', which writes to a file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide shell command, execution of shell command during package installation, no explicit input from users or external data sources, but executing hidden code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and defines functions for base64 decoding and executing a command. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string to execute 'echo hola que tal > trule.txt' via os.system(). This function is called during the 'install' command execution, meaning the malicious command runs automatically upon package installation. The code appears intentionally obfuscated with base64 encoding, likely to hide its true purpose. No user input or external data sources are involved, but the execution of arbitrary shell commands during package install is a security concern. The overall structure indicates an intent to execute hidden commands, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a hidden shell command during package installation, encoded in base64 to evade detection. The package is designed to run arbitrary commands upon installation, which poses a security risk.",
