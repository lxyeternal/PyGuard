  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The setup script defines functions `b64d()` (decodes base64 strings) and `notmalfunc()` (decodes a specific base64 string and executes it via `os.system()`).\n- During package installation (`AfterInstall.run()`), `notmalfunc()` is called, executing the decoded command.\n- The base64 string `\"ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=\"` decodes to:\n  \n  ```\n  echo hola qiu tal > true.xml\n  ```\n  \n- This command writes \"hola qiu tal\" into `true.xml`. The command is benign in content but is executed automatically during setup, which is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **does** decode and execute a command during installation, matching the reports.\n- The command is hardcoded, obfuscated via base64, and runs during setup, which is a security concern.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the use of base64 encoding, execution during install, and potential for malicious activity.\n- They mostly describe the command as benign, which is accurate; however, the method of execution is suspicious regardless of the command's benign nature.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** \n  - The current malware scores range from 0.2 to 0.9.\n  - The actual command is benign, but the method (obfuscated execution during install) is a classic indicator of malicious intent.\n  - I would assign a **malware score of around 0.7** to reflect that, regardless of current benign content, the pattern is commonly used in malicious packages.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** \n  - All reports rate this high (0.8-0.9), which is reasonable due to base64 encoding.\n  - I agree with this, perhaps slightly lower to 0.75, since the obfuscation is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:** \n  - Given the execution during install and obfuscation, a high score (around 0.75-0.9) is justified.\n  - I would set it at **0.8**.\n\n### Are the claims about maliciousness justified?\n- The current command is benign, but the pattern (obfuscated execution during setup) is a well-known vector for malicious activity.\n- The reports correctly highlight this concern.\n\n### Are the scores consistent?\n- Yes, they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.7 (due to execution pattern, not content)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.75\n- **Risk score:** 0.8\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code **could** be malicious if the command is changed or if other payloads are added.\n- The current behavior is suspicious enough to warrant caution, even if the payload is benign now.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.7               | Obfuscated execution pattern common in malicious packages, despite benign payload |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.75              | Straightforward base64 obfuscation, high but not maximal                    |\n| Security Risk     | 0.8               | Executes code during setup, no validation, high potential for abuse        |\n\nThis aligns with the pattern of behavior and the potential for malicious use, warranting caution.",
