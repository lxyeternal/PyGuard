  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that executes encoded system commands during installation and development.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decodes base64-encoded data, and the function notmalfunc executes the decoded string via os.system. The base64 string is hardcoded in the code.",
  "sinks": "os.system executes the decoded command, which can run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "b64d decodes the base64 string -> notmalfunc calls os.system with the decoded command -> command executes on the system",
  "anomalies": "The code uses base64 encoding for the command string, which is often a sign of obfuscation. The command executed is 'echo hola que tal > trule.xm', which writes to a file, potentially for malicious or stealthy purposes.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a base64 decoding function. It then defines a function notmalfunc that decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. The base64 string 'ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=' decodes to 'echo hola que tal > trule.xm'. The custom command classes AfterDevelop and AfterInstall run standard install/develop procedures and additionally execute notmalfunc during installation. This means that upon installation or development setup, the decoded command will execute, creating or overwriting a file named 'trule.xm' with the content 'hola que tal'. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, along with executing a system command during install, suggests potential malicious intent, possibly for stealth or persistence. There are no other suspicious library uses or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated to execute a benign-looking but hidden system command during installation. While the command itself writes a greeting to a file, the method of obfuscation and execution during setup could be used maliciously to execute arbitrary code or maintain persistence. This behavior should be considered suspicious and warrants further review, especially if the package is obtained from untrusted sources.",
