{
  "purpose": "The code executes a base64-decoded shell command during package installation, which is suspicious due to obfuscation and execution timing.",
  "sources": "The base64 string decoded in notmalfunc(), executed via os.system during install or develop commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded command; potential for executing arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc() executes os.system() with decoded command during install/develop.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to hide command; execution during setup phase without user input; hardcoded payload.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64 string that runs 'echo hola qiu tal > true.xml' via os.system during package setup. The obfuscation (base64) and execution timing are suspicious. The current command is benign but the pattern of obfuscated code executing during install is a common tactic in malicious packages. The malware score should reflect potential risk; obfuscation is high, and execution during setup is a security concern. Scores of malware around 0.5-0.6, obfuscation near 0.9, and security risk around 0.75 are appropriate, considering the current benign payload but recognizing the pattern's danger.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of obfuscated execution during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious. The current payload is benign, but the mechanism itself warrants caution. Scores should reflect moderate malware risk (~0.5-0.6), high obfuscation (~0.9), and significant security concern (~0.75).",
