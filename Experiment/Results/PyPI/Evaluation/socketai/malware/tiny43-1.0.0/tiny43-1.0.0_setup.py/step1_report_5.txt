{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes malicious behavior intended to execute a command upon installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d reading a base64-encoded string, and the notmalfunc function calling os.system with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code which runs a shell command.",
  "flows": "The base64 string decodes to a shell command; during package installation or development, notmalfunc is invoked, executing this command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded payload to hide execution, execution of shell command during install/develop phases, no user input involved but hidden code execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a function to decode base64-encoded strings, and another function that executes a shell command decoded from base64. The key malicious behavior is in the notmalfunc function, which decodes a base64 string and runs it via os.system. During the install and develop commands, notmalfunc is called, leading to execution of the decoded command. The encoded command 'ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=' decodes to 'echo hola qiu tal > truel.xml', which writes 'hola qiu tal' into a file named truel.xml. Although this specific command appears benign, the use of encoded strings and execution during install phases indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity or perform unauthorized actions. The overall structure suggests that the package performs an unintended or malicious action during setup, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a hidden command during installation or development setup, likely intended for covert actions or unauthorized modifications. The use of encoded commands and execution hooks strongly suggests malicious intent.",
