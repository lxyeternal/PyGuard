  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with hooks that execute code during installation and development, including executing a base64-decoded command.",
  "sources": "b64d() function decoding base64 string; notmalfunc() calling os.system with decoded command",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded command on the system shell",
  "flows": "notmalfunc() called during installation via AfterInstall.run() → executes os.system() with decoded command",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded string that decodes to shell command; execution during install process; no input validation or restrictions",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package using setuptools, with custom install and develop commands. The function b64d() decodes a base64 string to reveal a shell command. notmalfunc() executes this command via os.system(). The base64 string 'ZWNobyBob2xhIHF1ZSB0YWwgPiB0cnVlLnhtbAo=' decodes to 'echo hola qiu tal > true.xml', which writes 'hola qiu tal' into true.xml. This execution occurs during package installation via the AfterInstall.run() hook. No user input or external data influences this behavior; it appears hardcoded. The code performs a benign action (writing to a file), but the obfuscation via base64 and execution during install could be used maliciously for stealth or to execute arbitrary commands if modified. The overall behavior suggests a potential security concern, especially if the decoded command changes or if other payloads are added.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a base64-encoded command that executes during package installation, which is suspicious. While the current command is benign, the obfuscation and execution during install pose security risks and could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code warrants caution and further review for potential malicious behavior.",
