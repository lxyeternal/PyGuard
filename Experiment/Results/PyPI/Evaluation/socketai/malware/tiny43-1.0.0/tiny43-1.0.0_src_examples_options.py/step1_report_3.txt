  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided explicitly, but it appears to be a Python script that imports modules, possibly for some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or external sources (though none are explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows visible in the code snippet; the code primarily imports modules and performs variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are apparent. The code does not show any unusual or malicious behavior in the visible part.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements and possibly variable declarations. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious logic, or dangerous operations. The absence of network activity, system modifications, or hidden code suggests a benign nature. Since the code is very limited, a complete assessment cannot be performed, but no suspicious patterns are identified within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, focusing on module imports and variable definitions without any malicious or suspicious operations.",
