  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform a specific data processing or utility function, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the environment variables and possibly from user input or external files (if any are present). The code may also fetch data from network sources, depending on function implementations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, or data storage locations such as files or databases, if the code executes or writes data there.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user input through processing functions to output or external communication points, such as network calls or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are identified. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly user input. It processes this data using standard Python functions and may perform network operations or file I/O. No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors, are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard without malicious intent. There is no obfuscation, and the logic seems aligned with legitimate data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs typical data handling without any suspicious or malicious activities detected. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
