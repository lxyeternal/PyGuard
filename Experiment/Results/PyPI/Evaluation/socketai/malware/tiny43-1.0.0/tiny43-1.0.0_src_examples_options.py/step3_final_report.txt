{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code reviews, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, module imports, network or file I/O, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, potential command execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or data inputs flow into processing functions, which may interact with sinks like network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. All code snippets appear benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code snippets, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), appropriate for typical data handling or environment interactions. Confidence levels are high where detailed code exists; slightly lower where code is minimal or absent. The reasoning aligns with the code descriptions, and scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no malicious activity or obfuscation, with low security risks. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis. The dependency appears safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
