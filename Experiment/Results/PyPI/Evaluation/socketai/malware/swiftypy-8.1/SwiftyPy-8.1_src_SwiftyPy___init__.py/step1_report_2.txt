  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script, potentially for data processing or system management, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context and minimal comments.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, external files, or network sources if present. In this code, no explicit input sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include system calls, network connections, or file operations if any are present. The code does not explicitly perform such actions.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from external sources to sinks is identifiable within the code snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal comments, no logging, and some variable names are generic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are immediately apparent. No dynamic code execution or unusual features detected.",
  "analysis": "A line-by-line review shows standard Python syntax with no evidence of malicious payloads. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation mechanisms. The code lacks evident input validation flaws or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility script without malicious intent.",
