{
  "purpose": "The code reads environment variables and user input, potentially involving network or file operations, but shows no evidence of malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input",
  "sinks": "Network connections, subprocess calls, file operations",
  "flows": "Input sources to potential sinks such as network or file system",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious functions detected",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The confidence is moderate (0.7), given limited code context. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are observed. The data flow from input sources to sinks is typical for utility scripts. The absence of hardcoded secrets or malicious functions supports a benign assessment. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern based on available information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The assessments are consistent with the code's apparent nature.",
