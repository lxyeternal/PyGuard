  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, benign, and straightforward.\n- The functions perform basic calculations or return static strings.\n- No external data, network activity, or suspicious constructs are mentioned.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and there are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the descriptions. The `calcAverage` function computes an integer division average safely, and `lol()` returns a static string.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity or suspicious code. The code is simple and benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware activity.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0 or very low, indicating no security risk. This aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues:\n- **Flow and sinks:** No data sinks or external interactions are identified, which is consistent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are present.\n- **Reasoning flaws:** The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- Since the code is trivial, the risk scores could be even lower, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and correct in their assessment. The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious features. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe analysis confirms that the code is safe, and no further action is needed.",
