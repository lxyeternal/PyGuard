{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple function to calculate the integer average of a list and a function returning a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input list 'li' in the calcAverage function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; there are no outputs or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into the sum(li) operation, which then flows into the division by len(li).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage function computes the integer division of the sum of list elements by their count, which is a standard operation. The lol function simply returns a string. There are no code injection points, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code does not interact with the network, files, or environment variables, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility code with no malicious intent.",
