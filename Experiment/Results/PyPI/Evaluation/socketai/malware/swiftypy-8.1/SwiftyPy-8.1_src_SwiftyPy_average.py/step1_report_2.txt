{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple function to calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and a function returning a string.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the 'li' parameter in calcAverage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into the sum and division operations within calcAverage, which are standard calculations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one computes an integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string. No external input/output, no network activity, no code obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears benign, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It performs basic calculations and a static return, with no suspicious features.",
