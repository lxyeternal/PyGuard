  "purpose": "Calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and provide a humorous string",
  "sources": "Function parameters (li) in calcAverage",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data leaks or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Input list 'li' flows into sum and len functions to produce the average",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; the lol() function is harmless and unrelated",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function to compute the integer average of a list, using safe built-in functions. The lol() function returns a static string and does not interact with input or external systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended for simple utility or playful purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It performs basic calculations and returns a static string, both of which are safe.",
