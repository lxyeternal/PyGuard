{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and a trivial function returning a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'li' in calcAverage.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous way, such as executing code or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input list 'li' to the sum() function, then to the integer division to produce the average.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the functions are straightforward and do not contain obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage function calculates the integer average of a list, which is standard. The lol function simply returns a string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code does not include data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a simple utility module with no malicious behavior.",
