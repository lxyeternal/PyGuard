{
  "purpose": "Calculate the integer average of a list of numbers and provide a trivial string function.",
  "sources": "Input list 'li' in calcAverage function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'li' flows through sum() and len() to produce the average; no other data flows or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; functions are simple and benign.",
  "analysis": "The calcAverage function computes the integer division of the sum of the list by its length, which is straightforward and safe. The lol() function returns a static string. No indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. There are no external data sources, sinks, or potential for data leakage or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security risks.",
