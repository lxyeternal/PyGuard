{
  "purpose": "The code provides two simple functions: one calculates an integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (`li` in calcAverage), static return in lol()",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file interactions",
  "flows": "Input list to sum and length calculations; static string return",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, clear code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing basic arithmetic and returning a static string. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are simple, with no obfuscation or security-sensitive operations. The code does not interact with the environment, network, or files. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The overall structure is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are straightforward utility functions with no suspicious features. The security and malware scores should remain at 0, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
