{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external server, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered during the run method and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The request URL appears obfuscated and is directed to a suspicious domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com). The code executes during installation without user consent, collecting system data and transmitting it externally.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup parameters and extends the install command with a custom run method. In this method, system information is collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external, potentially malicious domain. The URL is obfuscated and indicates tracking or data exfiltration. No user prompts or consent are sought before sending data. The code does not appear to perform any other malicious activities but its behavior of transmitting system info during installation is suspicious and could be used for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system data and exfiltrating it to an external server during package installation without user consent. The obfuscated URL and data transmission are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
