{
  "purpose": "The code extends the setuptools installation process with a custom class that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, indicating malicious data theft during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system calls: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data to an external URL, acting as the sink where untrusted data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (system info) to the sink (HTTP request) during the run() method of the CustomInstall class, executed during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, sending system info to a suspicious external URL. The URL appears placeholder-like or obfuscated. The code is straightforward but embeds malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a custom install class that overrides run(). During run(), it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL. The URL is suspicious and likely malicious. The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is covert data exfiltration. The external URL's suspicious nature and the lack of user awareness make this malicious activity. The code's logic is simple and clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques. The data flow from system info sources to the external sink confirms malicious intent. The activity aligns with known malicious patterns of covert data theft during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to an external URL. This behavior is malicious, constituting a supply chain security threat. The activity is straightforward but highly suspicious and malicious in intent.",
