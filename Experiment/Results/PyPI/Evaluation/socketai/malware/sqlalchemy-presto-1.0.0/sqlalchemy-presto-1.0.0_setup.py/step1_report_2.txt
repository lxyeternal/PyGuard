  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that, after installation, collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment during the custom install run.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external domain, potentially without user consent.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and transmitted to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system info to an external server during package installation, which is not typical for normal setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom setup command that extends the standard install process. After executing the normal installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain, passing the collected data as URL parameters. The external domain appears to be a placeholder or potentially malicious server. The data transmission occurs automatically during install, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes without user awareness. No other malicious activities or obfuscated code are present. The code leverages standard libraries but uses them in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it operates without explicit user consent and may be used for tracking or data theft. The use of a seemingly malicious domain and the automatic nature of data transmission make this code risky.",
