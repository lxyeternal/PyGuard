{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to send system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with constructed parameters",
  "sinks": "requests.get() request sending data to external domain",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, current working directory, and username flows into the requests.get() call, which sends data to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code silently transmits system information to an external server during installation without user consent or notification. The URL used is suspicious and appears obfuscated or placeholder-like. No validation or security measures around data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and extends the install command to include a custom run method. During installation, it gathers system information: hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified URL. The request URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to exfiltrate system info without user awareness. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. There are no other malicious activities like code execution, backdoors, or data theft beyond info collection. The code's primary malicious aspect is the covert data transmission during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation. The code's intent is likely to track or gather user system data without consent, indicating malicious activity. The URL is suspicious and suggests the code is designed for clandestine data collection.",
