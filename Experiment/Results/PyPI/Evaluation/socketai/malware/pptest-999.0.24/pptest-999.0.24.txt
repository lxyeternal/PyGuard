      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating system information via DNS queries during package setup. Its activity aligns with common malware techniques, and the high scores for malware (~0.85) and security risk (~0.9) are justified. The obfuscation is minimal, with a score around 0.2. Overall, this code should be considered malicious or highly suspicious in an open-source dependency context."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, which is a suspicious activity indicative of malicious intent. While it does not contain destructive payloads or backdoors, its purpose aligns with covert communication or data theft. The activity warrants high suspicion and further review. The scores should reflect significant malicious potential due to exfiltration behavior, with malware score around 0.6, obfuscation around 0.2, and security risk around 0.8."
