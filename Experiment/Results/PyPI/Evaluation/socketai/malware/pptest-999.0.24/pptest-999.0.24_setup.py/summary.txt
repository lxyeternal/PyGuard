  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating system information via DNS queries during package setup. Its activity aligns with common malware techniques, and the high scores for malware (~0.85) and security risk (~0.9) are justified. The obfuscation is minimal, with a score around 0.2. Overall, this code should be considered malicious or highly suspicious in an open-source dependency context."
