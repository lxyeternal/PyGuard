      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated remote payload execution embedded within a package setup script. The silent, encoded PowerShell command targeting a suspicious URL indicates malicious intent, likely used for downloading or executing malicious payloads during installation. The high obfuscation and covert nature justify a malware score of approximately 0.8-0.9 and a security risk of similar magnitude. The package should be considered compromised or malicious, and further decoding of the payload confirms its malicious behavior."
