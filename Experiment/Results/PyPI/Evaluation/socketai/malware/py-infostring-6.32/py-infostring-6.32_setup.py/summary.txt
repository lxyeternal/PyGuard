  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command under conditional filesystem checks, combined with silent error suppression and suspicious comments. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the package should be flagged for further analysis or removal."
