      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during package installation. The pattern of obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression indicates potential malicious intent, such as backdoor installation or remote control. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until the encoded command is decoded and verified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscation ~0.85, security risk ~0.8) are justified and consistent with this analysis."
