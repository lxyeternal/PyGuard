{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious data stealer and system sabotage tool. It collects passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, browsing history, credit card details, and screenshots. It decrypts stored browser data, terminates security and analysis processes, checks for sandbox or VM indicators, and exfiltrates all gathered data via Discord webhooks and file uploads, often zipping data for transfer. It also performs process manipulations and anti-analysis checks to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Browser profile directories (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), registry keys, environment variables (local and roaming app data, temp), clipboard contents, process list, system info (UUID, hardware, IP, geolocation), user input/output, and local files (history, cookies, passwords, credit cards).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook, file uploads to transfer.sh or anonfiles, zipped archives of collected data, and direct file writes. Data flows from sources through decryption and collection routines into exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data is extracted from browser databases, registry, clipboard, and system info; decrypted using Windows-specific routines; stored temporarily; then sent via network requests or uploaded files. Process termination and anti-analysis checks occur concurrently to evade detection. Data is packaged into ZIP archives before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, extensive decryption routines, process termination of security tools, process killing commands, use of threading for concurrent operations, obfuscation tactics like regex patterns and dynamic function calls, inclusion of numerous process names and system checks for sandbox/VM detection, and extensive data collection routines. Some code segments appear designed to sabotage or evade analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: decrypts browser credentials, steals cookies and tokens, captures screenshots, collects system info, terminates security and debugging processes, checks for sandbox/VM indicators, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads. It uses threading to accelerate data collection, employs decryption routines specific to Windows, and includes obfuscation tactics such as regex patterns and dynamic process management. The presence of hardcoded addresses, extensive data harvesting, and sabotage behaviors confirms malicious intent. The code's structure and functions align with known info-stealer and sabotage malware, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for extensive data theft, system sabotage, and evasion. It employs decryption routines, process termination, and multiple exfiltration methods. The overall behavior and techniques justify assigning a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation around 0.3, and a high security risk score (~0.9). The analysis is thorough and consistent with the code's activities.",
