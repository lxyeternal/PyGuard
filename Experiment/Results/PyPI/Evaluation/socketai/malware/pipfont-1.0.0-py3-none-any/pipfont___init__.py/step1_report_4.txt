{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, tokens, browser data, and system information from the host system, and then send this data to a remote server via webhooks or uploads. It also attempts to scan files for keywords related to passwords and wallets, and package data into archives for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Inputs include environment variables, user directories, browser storage files, database files, registry entries, clipboard data, and user input. Data is read from local files (e.g., browser databases, system info files), environment variables, registry, and clipboard.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests (HTTP POSTs to remote URLs/webhooks), file uploads, and potentially malicious commands (e.g., process termination). Data exfiltration occurs through requests, file uploads, and zipped archives sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from browser cookies, passwords, tokens, and history flows from local storage/database files, is decrypted with master keys or CryptUnprotectData, then accumulated and sent to remote endpoints via HTTP requests or uploaded files. The code also captures system info and clipboard data, sending it similarly.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded URLs (webhook and pastebin), extensive use of decryption routines, process termination commands targeting known security tools, and multiple obfuscated or complex file handling routines. Also, it kills processes related to debugging or analysis tools, scans user directories for sensitive keywords, and packages data into ZIP archives for exfiltration. The code manipulates browser files, registry, and system info in ways consistent with malware.",
  "analysis": "The code actively scans user directories and browser data for passwords, cookies, tokens, and history, decrypts stored credentials, and collects system info such as hardware IDs, IP, and geolocation. It also terminates security and debugging processes to evade analysis. It uses network requests to send collected data to a remote server (webhook URL). It uploads specific files and creates ZIP archives for exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, decryption routines, process killing, and data harvesting routines strongly suggest malicious intent. The code is complex, obfuscated in parts, and designed to remain persistent and covert. It exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent, with functions to gather extensive personal and system information, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to hijack user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info, then exfiltrate the data stealthily to an attacker-controlled server. Its functionality includes process termination to evade detection, data encryption/decryption, file handling, and data exfiltration, all characteristic of information-stealing malware. The use of hardcoded webhooks, extensive system info collection, and process termination confirms its malicious intent.",
