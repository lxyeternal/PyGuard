  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for extensive data theft, system sabotage, and evasion. It employs decryption routines, process termination, and multiple exfiltration methods. The overall behavior and techniques justify assigning a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation around 0.3, and a high security risk score (~0.9). The analysis is thorough and consistent with the code's activities."
