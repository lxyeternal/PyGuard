  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during setup, with error suppression and no transparency. The pattern is characteristic of malicious payloads or backdoors in supply chain attacks. Scores should reflect high malware potential (around 0.8), high obfuscation (0.9), and high security risk (0.85). It is strongly recommended to analyze the decoded PowerShell payload to confirm intent and to treat this package as potentially malicious."
