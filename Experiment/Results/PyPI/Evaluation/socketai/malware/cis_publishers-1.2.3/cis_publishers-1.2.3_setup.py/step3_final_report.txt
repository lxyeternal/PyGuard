{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute during package installation, collecting system information (IP address, hostname, current path), encoding it in base64, and exfiltrating it to an external domain (kotko.org). It also writes a proof message to a local file. This behavior suggests malicious intent aimed at covert data collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system calls and network responses: requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), os.uname()[1], and the current file path via pathlib. These are used as sources for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests (requests.get to kotko.org with encoded data) and file writing (pocbykotko.txt). The network request is a sink where exfiltrated data leaves the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info sources (IP, hostname, path) into base64 encoding, then into the URL request to kotko.org. Simultaneously, the data is written into a local file. The registration of _post_install() via atexit ensures this flow occurs during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include: executing network requests during setup without user consent, writing a proof file, and encoding data before transmission. The registration of _post_install() with atexit in a custom install class is non-standard and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data collection (IP, hostname, path), encodes this data, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain during package installation. It also writes a proof message locally. The behavior is clearly malicious, aiming at covert data exfiltration. The code is not obfuscated, and no benign explanation justifies such activity during setup. The use of requests for network communication and file operations is direct and unmasked. The registration via atexit ensures execution during install, which is suspicious. The overall flow indicates active data theft with no user notification or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that exfiltrates system information during installation, representing a serious privacy and security threat. The behavior is straightforward, active during setup, and involves external communication to a suspicious domain. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with a malware score of 1.0 and security risk of 1.0 reflecting the high severity. It should be considered malicious and avoided.",
