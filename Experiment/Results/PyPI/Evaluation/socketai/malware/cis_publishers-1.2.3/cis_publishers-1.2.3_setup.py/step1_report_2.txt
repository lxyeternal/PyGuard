{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package intended for distribution via PyPI, with some additional behaviors during installation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include: reading 'README.md' for long description; requesting external IP via 'https://api.ipify.org'; obtaining system hostname via 'os.uname()[1]'; extracting the current path with 'pathlib'; and fetching external URL 'https://kotko.org'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks are: writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'; sending a Base64-encoded message containing IP, hostname, and path to 'https://kotko.org'.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code reads external data (IP, system hostname, path), encodes and transmits this data via HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. Additionally, it writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include: sending system IP, hostname, and path to an external domain; writing a file 'pocbykotko.txt' with proof content; registering a post-install function that executes these actions automatically; constructing a request URL with Base64-encoded data; commented out code and duplicated imports which suggest lack of clean structure.",
  "analysis": "The setup script performs standard packaging tasks but includes hidden malicious behavior: the '_post_install()' function, invoked during package install via 'atexit' registration, retrieves external IP address and system hostname, encodes this info, and sends it to a suspicious external domain. It also writes a proof file locally. These actions happen without user awareness, violating privacy. The code does not sanitize or validate the external URL or the data sent, and the request to 'kotko.org' is suspicious. No obfuscation is present; the malicious actions are hidden within the setup process. Other parts of the code, such as package metadata, appear normal.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded within the setup process, specifically exfiltrating system information to an external server without user consent. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The package should be considered malicious and not used.",
