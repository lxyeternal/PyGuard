{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package for distribution, with some custom post-install behavior that involves network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and the '_post_install' function reads/writes to a file ('pocbykotko.txt'), makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org', and sends encoded data to 'https://kotko.org'. It also accesses system information via 'os.uname()' and 'pathlib'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from HTTP responses ('requests.get'), system info ('os.uname()'), and encoded messages sent via requests to an external domain ('kotko.org'). The file 'pocbykotko.txt' is appended with a message.",
  "flows": "The code fetches external IP and system info, encodes this data in base64, and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. It also writes to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt') during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The '_post_install' function performs network communication with external servers and writes a suspiciously named file ('pocbykotko.txt') containing a proof message. The code encodes system info and IP address, then exfiltrates this data by appending it to a URL, which is a typical exfiltration pattern. The request to 'kotko.org' is suspicious and appears to be for covert data transmission. The code is also structured to run during package installation, which could be used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom installation class that registers a post-install function. The '_post_install' function collects system IP, hostname, and current path, encodes this info, and sends it to an external domain. It also appends a proof message to a local file. These behaviors indicate possible data exfiltration and covert operations. No other malicious code like code injection, reverse shells, or destructive actions are present. The external communication and file writing during install are unusual and suspicious, especially with the encoded data sent to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to a third-party domain during installation. It also writes a file with a proof message. These actions suggest malicious intent or covert data collection. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup. Overall, this package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
