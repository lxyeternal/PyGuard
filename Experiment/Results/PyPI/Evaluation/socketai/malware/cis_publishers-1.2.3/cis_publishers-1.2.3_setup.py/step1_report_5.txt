{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines package metadata and installation procedures for a Python project, including custom post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), reading the README.md file, writing to a local file, and environment data like hostname and current path.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with encoded data, file writing operations, and potential data exfiltration via network requests.",
  "flows": "The code gathers system and network information (IP, hostname, path), encodes it in base64, and transmits it to a suspicious domain (kotko.org). It also appends a text message to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install() function is registered to run after installation, which performs network requests to external sites and writes data to a local file without any validation or user consent. The network communication involves encoding system info and sending it to a potentially malicious domain. The hardcoded file name 'pocbykotko.txt' and the unencrypted data exfiltration are suspicious behaviors. The code comments out an unused function but does not remove it. The import of 'requests' is used solely within the post-install logic, which is unusual for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script includes standard package setup code with metadata and dependencies. However, it contains a function _post_install() that performs malicious-like actions: it writes to a local file, collects system info, encodes it in base64, and sends it to an external domain. This function is registered to run after installation, meaning anyone installing this package will trigger these actions. The network requests do not appear to serve a legitimate purpose related to package setup. The use of 'requests' for network activity and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, specifically data collection and exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during installation. The actions are embedded in the setup process and are not related to package functionality, indicating intent to spy or harvest data without user awareness. The code is not obfuscated but includes suspicious network activity and file writing, which are indicative of malicious activity.",
