{
  "purpose": "The script is primarily a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom post-install behavior that sends data over the network.",
  "sources": "Network requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reading the README.md file, and writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with encoded data, writing to local files, and potentially exposing system information (IP address, hostname, path).",
  "flows": "Source: Reading local files and system info -> Sink: Sending system info and IP to external URLs; Writing proof of execution to local file.",
  "anomalies": "The '_post_install' function performs network operations to send system info and writes a proof file, which is unusual for a typical setup script. The network activity appears to transmit potentially sensitive system data to external domains without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard setup procedures for packaging a Python project, but it also defines a custom installation class that registers a post-install function. This function ('_post_install') performs network operations: it writes a proof file ('pocbykotko.txt') locally, then retrieves the system's public IP address, the hostname, and the current path, encodes this information in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('kotko.org'). Such behavior is suspicious in a package setup context, as it leaks system information without transparent disclosure. No malicious code like reverse shells, data exfiltration of user data beyond system info, or destructive actions are present, but the data exfiltration and the covert nature of network activity are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains code that secretly collects system information and transmits it to an external server during installation, which is a malicious privacy violation and potentially malicious behavior. The core setup code is standard, but the additional post-install steps are suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
