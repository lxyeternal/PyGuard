  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the obfuscated, conditional execution of a PowerShell command during package setup. The pattern aligns with common supply chain attack techniques, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be treated as compromised or malicious pending further investigation."
