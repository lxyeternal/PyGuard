      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, likely designed for malicious remote code execution or payload delivery. The silent error handling and external URL further increase the risk. Scores assigned are appropriate, indicating high malware potential and security threat. The package should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms its behavior."
