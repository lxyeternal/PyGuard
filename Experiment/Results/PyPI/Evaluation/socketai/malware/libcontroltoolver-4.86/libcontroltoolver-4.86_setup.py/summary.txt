  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered during package setup. The presence of suspicious URLs, obfuscation, and silent error handling reinforce the likelihood of malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should reflect this."
