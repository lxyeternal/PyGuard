      "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell code during setup, indicating high potential for malicious activity. The observed behavior aligns with supply chain sabotage tactics. The high obfuscation and stealthy execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. While definitive confirmation requires decoding the payload, current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious or compromised."
