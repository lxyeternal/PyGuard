  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The presence of suspicious URL and error suppression further support malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, indicating a high security threat, and decoding the payload would be necessary for definitive confirmation."
