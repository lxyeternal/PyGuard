  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command under a filesystem condition, with high obfuscation and stealth tactics. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely a vector for malicious payloads. The security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for further investigation."
