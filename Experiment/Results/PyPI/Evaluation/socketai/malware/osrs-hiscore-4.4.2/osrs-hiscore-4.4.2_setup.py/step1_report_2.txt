{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also performs network communication and possibly executes a downloaded file during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs for network requests, and the requests.get() responses.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded file with os.system(), sending data over the network via requests.get().",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sends data to remote server -> Downloads executable -> Executes downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic network requests based on environment variables, downloading and executing an external file during installation, broad exception handling swallowing errors, absence of input validation or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via HTTP GET to a suspicious domain. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it immediately. The 'PostInstallCommand' runs this 'send()' function after the package installation. The use of environment variables, unverified remote code execution, and external downloads during package setup are highly suspicious behaviors that could be malicious, especially considering the code's obfuscation of intent by hiding network activity and execution within the setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior patterns including remote data exfiltration, downloading and executing external payloads during package installation, and broad exception suppression. These are typical indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior.",
