{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'osrs-hiscore' package with a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "sinks": "The code downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it via os.system().",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used in a URL, which is fetched, and an external executable is downloaded and run based on platform detection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending environment info to an external URL and downloading/executing a potentially malicious executable during installation. The URL domains are suspicious and do not belong to known safe providers. The use of os.system() to run downloaded content is a high-risk behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and makes use of requests to perform network operations during post-install. It retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it as part of a GET request to an external site. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it directly, which is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks. The try-except block suppresses errors, making detection more difficult. These behaviors collectively indicate malicious intent or at least high-risk behavior, especially since it executes downloaded content without verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data, downloading, and executing an external executable during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious supply chain tactics.",
