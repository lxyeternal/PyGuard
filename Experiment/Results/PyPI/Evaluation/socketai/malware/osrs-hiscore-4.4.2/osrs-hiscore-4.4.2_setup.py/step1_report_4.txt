{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'osrs-hiscore' with custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs in 'send()' function, 'requests' library calls.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', making an HTTP request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' with environment data.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' env var -> sends data to linkedopports.com -> Downloads a potentially malicious executable -> Executes it using os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send()' function contacts an external server with environment info, downloads an executable, and executes it without user consent. Use of broad exception handling and dynamic execution via 'os.system' without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and defining a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this data via a GET request to a suspicious domain. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a seemingly malicious URL and executes it silently. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send()' function during installation. The setup configuration registers this command. The behavior indicates potential malicious activity: exfiltration of environment info, downloading, and executing a remote payload, which could be harmful or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by contacting external servers, exfiltrating environment data, downloading, and executing a potentially harmful file without user knowledge. These actions pose a significant security risk, making this package dangerous for use.",
