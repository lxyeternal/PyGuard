{
  "purpose": "The code performs malicious actions during package installation, including exfiltrating system info, downloading, and executing a remote payload, indicating an attempt to compromise the system.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; retrieves system info; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains; downloaded executable file executed via os.system; data sent to remote server.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable and system info) -> exfiltration via requests.get; remote URL download -> execution via os.system during install.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional network requests and remote code execution during setup; broad exception handling masking errors; no validation of downloaded payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly retrieves system info, exfiltrates it, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it during installation, all within a try/except block that suppresses errors. These behaviors are characteristic of malware and supply chain attacks. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs actions that pose high security risks. The external URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded code without validation is dangerous. The broad exception handling further conceals potential errors, making detection harder. The malicious activities justify a malware score of 1, a high security risk score, and confirm the code's malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior involving remote data exfiltration and execution of untrusted code during package installation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and risk scores at 1, and obfuscation at 0. The package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
