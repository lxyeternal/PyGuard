{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'osrs-hiscore' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs and executing downloaded files via os.system.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL request; if platform is Windows, it downloads and executes a file from an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional external network requests during install, use of os.system to run potentially malicious downloaded file, and sending system info to external URL without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that attempts to retrieve the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a dubious URL and executes it, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. This behavior is embedded within the custom install command, so it triggers during package installation. No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent due to external communications and execution of remote code.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system info, downloads and executes arbitrary code during installation, and contacts suspicious domains. This constitutes a security risk and malicious intent.",
