{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with a custom post-installation process that includes downloading and executing an external file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URLs for requests ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr').",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) which executes a downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via GET request to external server; then a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Code retrieves an environment variable and uses it in a network request; downloads an executable file from an untrusted source and runs it without validation; exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules, requests, and system modules. The 'send()' function attempts to send the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to a remote server and then downloads and executes an executable from a suspicious URL, which is a significant security risk. The execution of an external executable during installation, especially from untrusted sources, indicates malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The try-except block suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures or malicious activity. The custom post-install command ensures this malicious activity occurs after package installation. The overall structure suggests an intent to exfiltrate system info and execute arbitrary code, typical of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment information, downloading, and executing an untrusted executable during installation, constituting a supply chain security risk. The overall malicious intent is high due to remote communication, code execution, and lack of safeguards.",
