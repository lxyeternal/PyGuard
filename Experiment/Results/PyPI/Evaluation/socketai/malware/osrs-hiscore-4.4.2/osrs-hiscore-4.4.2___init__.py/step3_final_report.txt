  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward function with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no system modifications. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence (1), and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
