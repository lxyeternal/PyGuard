{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'selfgetintelgame' with specified metadata and packages. It also attempts to execute a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory and potentially executes a PowerShell command based on that. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen runs an encoded PowerShell command, which could potentially be malicious if the encoded command is harmful or exfiltrates data.",
  "flows": "If the 'tahg' directory does not exist, the code executes the PowerShell command. This command could perform actions such as data exfiltration, backdoor setup, or other malicious activity. The setup function runs afterwards but appears unrelated to the malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a base64-encoded PowerShell command executed without validation or user consent. The command is hidden and obfuscated, indicating possible malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package but includes a suspicious encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally. The command is encoded, which is often used to hide malicious payloads. The code also suppresses exceptions silently, which is suspicious. Overall, the main concern is the embedded PowerShell command that could perform malicious actions. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident apart from this activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily sets up a Python package but contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation or avoidance.",
