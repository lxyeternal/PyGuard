The high scores for malware (around 0.8), obfuscation (around 0.9), and security risk (around 0.85) are justified. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious, requiring thorough review before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, though a slightly lower score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified given the absence of suspicious features. Overall, the code appears safe for supply chain purposes."
