  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, though a slightly lower score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified given the absence of suspicious features. Overall, the code appears safe for supply chain purposes."
