      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily driven by obfuscated PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, external URL comment, and silent error handling. The assigned high scores are appropriate, though decoding the payload would be necessary for definitive classification. Overall, the script appears to be a red-flag for supply chain or backdoor malicious behavior."
