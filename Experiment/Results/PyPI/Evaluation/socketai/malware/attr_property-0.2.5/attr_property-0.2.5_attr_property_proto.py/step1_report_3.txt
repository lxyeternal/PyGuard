{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, handling proxy negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, and user credentials (username and password). Data is read from network responses via socket.recv and getaddrinfo calls for DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the network through sock_sendall and sock_connect methods; potentially untrusted data (hostnames, IP addresses, credentials) flows into network communications.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, optional credentials) flows into address resolution and socket connection; network responses (proxy server replies, DNS responses) flow back into the code for validation and further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard socket operations and asyncio event loop methods; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling is observed. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage is present. Error handling appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with asynchronous support. It performs address resolution, negotiates proxy authentication, and establishes connections. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activities are evident. It correctly manages socket lifecycle and error handling. Usage of standard modules and methods suggests legitimate functionality without malicious intent. No signs of code obfuscation or malware are detected. All data flows are consistent with proxy connection procedures, and there are no indicators of malicious code injection or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles network proxy negotiations securely and properly without suspicious or hidden activities.",
