  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS4/5 proxy client implementation with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The low risk score aligns with the lack of security concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client with proper handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no hidden behaviors or malicious indicators. Slightly higher risk score may reflect the general exposure of proxy code but still low.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent reasoning; no hidden malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clean, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of proxy code (exposure to untrusted proxies or credentials). Given the code's clarity and standard protocol implementation, these are reasonable.\n\n### Potential Concerns & Assumptions:\n\n- The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The logic aligns with standard SOCKS protocol implementations.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or sabotage.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (moderate, due to proxy usage, but justified by the code's transparency)\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and justified. No modifications are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2    |\n\n**This code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
