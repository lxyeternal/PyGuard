  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Given the code's purpose and the review's confidence (0.95), these scores seem reasonable. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score than Report 1, but still very low, matching the detailed reasoning. The confidence (0.9) supports this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The code is a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments. The low risk score aligns with the lack of concerning features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer concludes the code is a typical, non-malicious SOCKS proxy wrapper, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** The high confidence (0.9) and consistent reasoning support these scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, matching the absence of obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting low but non-zero concern, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and the thorough review.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2 (average of the reports, considering the low but present minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate, given the context and the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores accurately reflect the analysis.",
