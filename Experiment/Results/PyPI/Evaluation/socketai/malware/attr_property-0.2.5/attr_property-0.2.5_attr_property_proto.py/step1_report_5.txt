{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket communication, allowing connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from hostnames, ports, user credentials, and configuration parameters such as rdns and proxy type. Data is received from network responses during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets during connection negotiation and authentication, and data is received from the network during responses. No data is written to disk or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows into connection and authentication procedures, which then send data to and receive data from proxy servers. The flow involves resolving addresses, negotiating proxy protocols, and establishing connections.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious variable names. The code performs standard proxy negotiation procedures. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are present. No hardcoded credentials or external data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, utilizing asyncio for asynchronous network operations. It includes address resolution, protocol negotiation, optional authentication, and connection establishment routines. The use of well-defined protocol constants and exception handling suggests a secure, purpose-driven design. No suspicious network behavior, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated or hidden behaviors. All network communications are appropriate for proxy negotiation. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate proxy client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. It performs expected functions without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external factors such as use with untrusted proxies or credentials, which are not hardcoded. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
