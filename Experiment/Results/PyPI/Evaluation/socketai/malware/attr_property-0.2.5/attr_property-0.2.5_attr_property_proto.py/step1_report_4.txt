{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of classes and functions to establish and manage proxy connections (SOCKS4, SOCKS5) using asyncio, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "User-provided host and port inputs for proxy server and destination address, environment variables for credentials (if set externally), socket connection attempts, address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over sockets, reading socket data, resolving hostnames, and possibly encoding credentials.",
  "flows": "Input addresses (host/port) are resolved, socket connections are established to proxy, then negotiation occurs (authentication and connection request), with data sent/received via socket wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; credentials are passed externally, no suspicious command or data manipulation observed. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. No network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft code present. No backdoors or hidden behavior found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including authentication, address resolution, and connection handling. It uses standard libraries and practices without signs of malicious intent. The functions handle data securely and do not contain suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code relies on user inputs or external parameters for credentials, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network behavior is detected. Overall, the code appears legitimate for its purpose, with no malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of proxy connection handling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly manages data flows, authentication, and address resolution. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
