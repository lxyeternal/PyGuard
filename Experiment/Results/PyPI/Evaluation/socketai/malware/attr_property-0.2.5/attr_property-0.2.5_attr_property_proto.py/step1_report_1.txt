{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous socket wrappers for connecting through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, supporting authentication, address resolution, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection (_socks_host, _socks_port, _dest_host, _dest_port); address resolution via getaddrinfo; socket data received via sock_recv; user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Sending data over the network (_send), establishing connections (_loop.sock_connect), and receiving data (_receive).",
  "flows": "Input host/port data flows through address resolution and proxy negotiation to establish a socket connection; authentication data flows from client credentials to proxy server; received data flows back from the proxy/server to the client.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens; no suspicious URL or domain usages; code structure is typical for proxy handling. No evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous socket handling for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, connection, and optional authentication. Error handling aligns with protocol specifications, and no secret data or external communication outside expected proxy interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors detected. The logic appears to be a typical proxy client implementation with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with proper error handling and address resolution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Overall, it is a standard proxy connection module without malicious intent.",
