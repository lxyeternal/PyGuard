{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for establishing network connections through proxy servers, supporting authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from socket connections (e.g., recv, sock_recv), configuration parameters (host, port, username, password), and address resolution results.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data over network sockets (sock_sendall), constructs and sends protocol-specific request packets, and receives responses from proxy servers.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., hostnames, user credentials) are processed, potentially resolved, and then sent to proxy servers via socket requests; responses are read and interpreted to establish the connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code performs standard proxy protocol negotiation and socket handling. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code adheres to standard implementations of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It uses secure socket operations without evident malicious manipulation. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity is detected within this module. It handles errors properly, raising specific exceptions for different failure scenarios. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured proxy client implementation, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for network communication, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows standard protocols and safe socket handling practices.",
