{
  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client with support for authentication, address resolution, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames/IP addresses, port numbers, and optional user credentials; data is read during address resolution, authentication, and socket communication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows occur during socket communication, address resolution, and negotiation responses, which could potentially lead to data leaks or command injection if manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hostnames/IPs, credentials) are processed through address resolution and authentication steps, then used in socket connection and negotiation requests, with responses influencing connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code follows standard proxy client protocols without suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, handling address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation properly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, and the logic aligns with typical proxy protocols. The malware score is justified as 0 due to the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting potential external misuse but not inherent vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.95).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
