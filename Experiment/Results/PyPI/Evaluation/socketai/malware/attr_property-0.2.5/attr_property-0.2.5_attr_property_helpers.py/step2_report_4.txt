  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation**:\n   - The code provides functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`, `open_connection`, `create_connection`) to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies asynchronously.\n   - It correctly parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4/SOCKS5, and manages connections with proper parameter validation.\n   - No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, is evident.\n   - The code relies on external, reputable libraries (`yarl`, `attr_property`) and standard asyncio functions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The code does not validate the content of the proxy URL beyond host and port, which could be a concern if untrusted URLs are used; however, this is typical and not inherently malicious.\n   - Exception handling is minimal but appropriate for the context.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n   - **Security Risk**: Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting that accepting untrusted URLs can pose risks, but this is standard for proxy configuration.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The code's potential risk mainly stems from the use of untrusted URLs, but this is a common scenario, not malicious.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious or suspicious logic.\n   - They emphasize the standard, legitimate use of proxy connections without overestimating potential risks.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign assessment.\n   - No anomalies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2** (reflecting typical proxy configuration risks, not malicious activity)\n\n### Justification:\n- The code performs legitimate functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The only minor concern is handling untrusted URLs, which is standard and not malicious in itself.\n\n**Overall, the supply chain risk from this code appears minimal and well within acceptable bounds for such functionality.**",
