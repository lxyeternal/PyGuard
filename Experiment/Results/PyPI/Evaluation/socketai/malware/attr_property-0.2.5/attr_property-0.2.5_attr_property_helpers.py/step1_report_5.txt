{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.",
  "sources": "User-provided proxy URL (`socks_url`) and target host/port inputs.",
  "sinks": "Connection establishment via `asyncio.open_connection` and `loop.create_connection`, which can send data over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL is parsed to extract proxy details, which are used to create a socket wrapper. The wrapper connects to the proxy, then data flows from the proxy to the target host via established socket connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs no unusual or obfuscated operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are present. It uses standard libraries and conventional proxy connection methods.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles parsing of proxy URLs, creation of socket wrappers, and establishing connections through proxies. It relies on external libraries for proxy handling (`attr_property.proto`) and does not include any code that exfiltrates data, executes malicious commands, or connects to suspicious domains. The functions are designed to facilitate network connections via proxies, with proper validation of inputs. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are evident. It appears to be standard network proxy connection code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for creating proxy connections with asyncio in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The primary security consideration is to ensure that the proxy URL and target host are trusted, but the code itself does not introduce malicious risks.",
