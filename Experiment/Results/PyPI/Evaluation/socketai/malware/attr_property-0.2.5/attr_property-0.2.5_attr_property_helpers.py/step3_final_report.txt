  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and managing connections.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, user-provided host and port, external libraries (yarl, attr_property), asyncio event loop",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URLs and parameters, network socket connections",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() reads proxy URL -> create_socket_wrapper() creates socket based on proxy type -> open_connection()/create_connection() establish connection via socket",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; minimal validation of proxy URL scheme; accepts untrusted URLs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It parses proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages connections with basic validation. No malicious or suspicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. External libraries used are reputable. The code handles untrusted URLs in a typical manner for proxy configuration, which could pose minor risks but is standard practice. Exception handling is appropriate, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection setup with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects minimal concerns, primarily related to untrusted URL handling, which is typical for such utilities.",
