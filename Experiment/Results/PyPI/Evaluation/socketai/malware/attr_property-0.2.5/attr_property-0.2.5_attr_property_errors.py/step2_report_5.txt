  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The original code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.\n   - No data input, external connections, or logic are present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions and are straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code appears benign, serving as error handling scaffolding.\n\n3. **Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty that the code is safe and non-malicious.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No changes needed in their reasoning or scoring.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no runtime behavior, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring is appropriate.",
