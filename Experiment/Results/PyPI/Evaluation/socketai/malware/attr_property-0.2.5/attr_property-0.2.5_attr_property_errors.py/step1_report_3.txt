{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; class definitions and exception inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow; exception class hierarchy without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Code solely defines exception classes without implementing any logic; no suspicious or unusual behavior, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no data inputs, network operations, or logic that could be exploited or contain malicious intent. The structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or hidden code exists.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or logic that could be malicious.",
