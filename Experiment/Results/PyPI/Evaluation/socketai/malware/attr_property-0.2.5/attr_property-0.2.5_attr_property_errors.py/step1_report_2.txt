{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading functions present; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions to handle SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. There are no functions, input/output operations, or logic that could be exploited or malicious. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be part of a larger module dedicated to error handling for SOCKS proxy interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is purely definitional, establishing exception classes without any malicious or security-risking behavior. It does not contain any malware, suspicious activities, or security concerns. The code is benign and appears to be standard error handling scaffolding.",
