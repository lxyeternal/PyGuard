  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues. All classes inherit from standard exceptions, and there are no functions, data processing, network calls, or embedded logic. The code is static, simple, and typical for error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code only defines exception classes with no data input, processing, or suspicious patterns. This is consistent with the original code.  \n  **Yes, the issues are not present.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n  **No, no errors or flaws are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Confidence scores:** All are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is needed for higher scores.  \n- The code is purely definitional, with no runtime behavior, data flow, or network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- **Are there any signs of malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code only defines exception classes. No embedded payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n  **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly assume no vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on the code snippet.  \n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made that are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and serves as error handling scaffolding. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation.",
