{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs; these are class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; no output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow related to input or external data handling; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; standard exception class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, with no data processing, input handling, or external communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The classes serve as error markers for SOCKS proxy errors and related authentication failures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
