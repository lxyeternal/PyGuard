  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.\n   - No data input, network operations, or logic are present.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is justified.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, malware, or security risks, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could lead to exploitation or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's structure and content.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as purely definitional.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
