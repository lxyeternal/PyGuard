{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading mechanisms present; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow mechanisms; only exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; the code contains only class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. All classes are standard exception subclasses with no embedded logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception types. There are no data inputs, no functions, and no executable code. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The classes are straightforward and serve as specific error types likely used elsewhere in a larger codebase. No signs of malware, suspicious patterns, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. No malicious intent or malicious behavior can be inferred from these class declarations.",
