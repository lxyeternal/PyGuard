  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Issue presence in code**: All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for exceptions, with no data processing, network activity, or logic. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report**: The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly state that the code is purely definitional, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` is 1 for all, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5**: None of the reports assign a high risk score. Given the code is only exception class definitions, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score justification**: All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**: The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that the code is purely definitional and lacks any suspicious activity.\n\n7. **Score consistency**: The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Final conclusion**: The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Work-through reasoning**:\n- The code is simple class declarations inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- No data input, network activity, or logic.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Final recommendation**: All scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
