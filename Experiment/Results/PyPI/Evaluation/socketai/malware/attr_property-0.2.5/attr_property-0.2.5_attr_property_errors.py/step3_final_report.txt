  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no data input, network calls, or logic.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely class declarations without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exceptions with no methods or data attributes. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is static and purely definitional, serving as error indicators. The absence of network activity, data processing, or embedded payloads indicates no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
