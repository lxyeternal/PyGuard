  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The provided code defines several custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.\n   - All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or custom base exceptions, with no methods, data attributes, or logic.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as error indicators.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward and typical for error handling in network modules.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Malware:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, it cannot directly cause security issues or malware.\n   - No external interactions, data processing, or network operations are involved.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the nature of the code, there is no basis to assume malicious intent.\n   - Exception class definitions are common in error handling modules and do not imply malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The reports' reasoning aligns well with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious or obfuscating elements.",
