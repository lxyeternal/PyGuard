{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues",
  "sources": "None; all classes are defining exception types without data input",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, storage, or output operations",
  "flows": "None; code only declares exception classes without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. No data input handling, no external connections, or data leaks are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, defining specific error types for SOCKS proxy handling, which is common in network-related modules. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
