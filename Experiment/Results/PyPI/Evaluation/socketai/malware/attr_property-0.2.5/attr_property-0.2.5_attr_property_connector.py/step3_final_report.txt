  "purpose": "Provides a proxy connector implementation for aiohttp supporting various proxy types, credentials, and DNS resolution options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy type, host, port, username, password, and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for proxy, socket connection and wrapping, and request proxy updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> proxy_url property -> socket wrapper creation -> connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; socket wrapping and URL handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard aiohttp proxy connector with configurable proxy type, credentials, and DNS resolution. Proxy URL is constructed dynamically, and socket wrapping is used for non-HTTP proxies. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's logic aligns with typical proxy handling practices, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured proxy connector with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe for use.",
