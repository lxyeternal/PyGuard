{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing and re-exporting classes, functions, and constants related to a SOCKS proxy library, facilitating organized access to its components.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and defines a version string; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static import statements and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes namespace exports without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module setup, importing classes and functions from local modules and defining __version__ and __all__ for exports. It contains no network activity, data handling, or dynamic execution. The structure is clean, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, and the scores are consistent with the code's static, organizational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
