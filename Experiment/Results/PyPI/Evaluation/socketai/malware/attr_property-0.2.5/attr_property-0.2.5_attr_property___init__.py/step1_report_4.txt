{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and export components for a SOCKS proxy client or server implementation, including connectors, error handling, helpers, and protocol definitions.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or data; it imports modules and defines exports. No user input or untrusted data sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows or where data might be leaked or exploited, such as network transmission or file writing, within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Since the code only imports and exports components without executing functions or data processing, no data flows from sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is standard for a Python module defining and exporting components.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an interface module, importing various classes and functions related to SOCKS proxy handling and re-exporting them. No input reading, data processing, or network operations occur here. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is detected. It appears to be a typical package structure file.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this code. It functions as a standard module initializer and exporter for proxy-related components.",
