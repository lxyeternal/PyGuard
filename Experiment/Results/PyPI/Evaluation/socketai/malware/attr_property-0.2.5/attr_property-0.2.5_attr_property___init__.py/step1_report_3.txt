{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define module exports for a proxy-related library, facilitating proxy connections with error handling and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), possibly external dependencies if present within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input are evident; no network or file operations are directly shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; this code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets are observed. The version string appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and exports, with no execution of untrusted input or sensitive operations. It does not perform any data handling, network communication, or configuration manipulations. All elements are static and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an interface for other components, and there are no suspicious behaviors detected.",
