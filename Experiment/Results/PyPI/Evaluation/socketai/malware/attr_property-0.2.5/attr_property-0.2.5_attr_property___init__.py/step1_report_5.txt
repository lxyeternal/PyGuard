{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module that manages proxy connections, errors, and helpers for network communication, likely as part of a larger proxy or SOCKS client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network or file operations are performed directly within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is observable; this code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy handling, error management, and connection helpers. It defines version information and exports symbols for use by other parts of the package. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external network interactions. The structure suggests this is a library setup module rather than executable logic that could contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It mainly organizes and exposes components without performing any operations that could be exploited.",
