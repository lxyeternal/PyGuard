  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward Python module that imports various classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and exports these components via `__all__`.\n- No data processing, network operations, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code appears benign and standard for a module setup.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None identified.\n- **Security flaws:** None present.\n- **Code quality:** The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module entry point.\n\n### Scores given by reports:\n- All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0 or very low.\n- These scores are reasonable given the code content.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely import/export setup with no active logic, network operations, or data handling, a high risk score is unjustified.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- The security risk should also be very low, as the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume this code is part of a proxy client/server library, which is consistent with the import names.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation, so any claim suggesting potential vulnerabilities based on this code alone is unfounded.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports' scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The code is a standard module initializer for a proxy library.\n- No active data flows, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code does not contain any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the existing assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or security risks. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, and very low for security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's nature.",
