{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a SOCKS proxy client or server implementation, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data input is directly read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, or environment variable access are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The code only defines imports and exports; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It primarily consists of module setup and re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The file sets up module-level metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports various components necessary for proxy operation. No data processing, user input handling, or external communication is observed. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns or behaviors. It appears to be a standard library module structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any active data flows or potentially malicious instructions.",
