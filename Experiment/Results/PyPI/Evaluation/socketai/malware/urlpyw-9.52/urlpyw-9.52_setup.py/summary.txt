  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. While the payload's exact content is unknown, the obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, and further analysis (decoding the payload) is recommended. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.75, obfuscation near 0.9, and security risk about 0.8—are justified given the suspicious activity."
