  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code snippet, the purpose of the code, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module initialization script, primarily importing classes, functions, and constants from external and internal modules, then defining an `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n- It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The imports are from trusted-looking modules (`python_socks`, local modules), aligned with the purpose of proxy handling for `aiohttp`.\n- The code appears to be a standard `__init__.py` or main module file for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a module interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes the code as package initialization, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to above, standard module export code with no malicious indicators.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, standard setup code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others, no signs of malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk score (0.1), possibly due to the general nature of import-based code.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Justification:** Since the code only imports and exports components, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling, the malware score should remain at 0. The slight security risk score might be justified if considering the potential for supply chain issues, but based solely on this code, it's minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely static and structural.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, ideally 0, given the absence of dynamic or sensitive operations.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard, safe module setup for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling. No evidence suggests supply chain risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores should reflect the benign nature of this code, with malware and obfuscated scores at zero, and risk scores also minimal.",
