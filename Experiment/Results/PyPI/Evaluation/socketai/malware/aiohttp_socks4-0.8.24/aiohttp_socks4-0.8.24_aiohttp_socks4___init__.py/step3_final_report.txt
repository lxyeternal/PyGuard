{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file for the 'aiohttp-socks' package, importing classes, functions, and constants related to proxy handling and exporting them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks' and local modules such as '.connector', '.utils', and '._deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; static import statements with no runtime data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up namespace exports.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. All imports are from trusted modules, and the __all__ list clearly defines the public API. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to expose classes and functions for proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score is justified by its static nature, and malware score remains at zero.",
