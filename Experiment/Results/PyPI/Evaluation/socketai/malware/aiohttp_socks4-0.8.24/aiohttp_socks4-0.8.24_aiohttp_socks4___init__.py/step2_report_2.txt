  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as evaluate the scores assigned, especially focusing on malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static module setup consisting solely of import statements, attribute definitions, and an `__all__` export list.\n- No runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious variable names are evident.\n- External dependencies (like `python_socks`) are trusted and relevant for the package's purpose.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module entry point for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual report review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as a module interface for proxy handling.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity, no anomalies, and correctly notes the static nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **reasonable**.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, describes the code as a package init file.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, describes the code as an export module.\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious activity, typical import/export pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **justified**.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Again, a standard proxy package module.\n- **Analysis:** No data handling, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, describes a package setup.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — **slightly higher risk score**, but the reasoning is that it's a static setup with no actual runtime behavior.\n- **Justification:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) is acceptable given the minimal potential for risk in static code, but it's still very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero in all cases, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n\n### **Potential concerns or points of challenge:**\n\n- Since the code is purely static and involves no runtime logic, the malware and obfuscation scores should be **0**.\n- The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 might be marginally justified if considering the import of external dependencies, but generally, static import files without runtime behavior are very low risk.\n- None of the reports mention any dynamic or suspicious activity, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk inherent in static import/export code)\n\n**The existing scores are reasonable, with the exception of report 5's 0.1 risk score, which could be lowered to 0.** \n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  | Justification                                                  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Static module, no malicious code                                |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Same reasoning                                                  |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      | No dynamic behavior                                              |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Typical package init file                                         |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Static, no suspicious activity; risk score can be lowered further |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, and the scores should reflect that. No further action needed unless additional runtime code or dynamic behaviors are provided.",
