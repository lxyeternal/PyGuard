{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to proxy handling and SOCKS connections for the 'aiohttp-socks' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'python_socks', local modules '.connector', '.utils', and '._deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly imports and re-exports components, no data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports from external libraries or local modules, then exports selected components; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an export list (__all__). It imports classes and functions related to proxy configurations and SOCKS proxies from trusted modules. There is no evidence of data manipulation, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, serving as a public API surface. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization that exports classes and functions related to SOCKS proxies and connections. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are apparent.",
