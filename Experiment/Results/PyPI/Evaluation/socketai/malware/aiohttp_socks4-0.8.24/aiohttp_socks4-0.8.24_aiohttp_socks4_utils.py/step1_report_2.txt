  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to create network connections through a specified proxy server, supporting SOCKS5 proxies and custom protocols.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as proxy_url, host, port, username, password, and optional configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses proxy connection to establish sockets and opens network connections, potentially handling untrusted proxy URLs or input data.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing from input parameters → Proxy creation → Socket connection via proxy → Opening of network connection or protocol-specific connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors detected. Proxy URL parsing is standard but could potentially be manipulated if untrusted input is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two async functions for establishing network connections through a proxy, with proper parameter validation. It uses the python_socks library to parse proxy URLs and create proxy objects. Both functions handle user input parameters carefully, with validation to prevent missing host or port. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The code’s purpose is to facilitate network communication over proxies, with no evident data leakage, command execution, or malicious payloads. The proxy URL parsing is a common pattern, and the code uses standard asyncio operations for socket management. The code relies on external libraries (python_socks), which are standard for proxy handling and do not by themselves indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for creating proxy-based network connections. No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The overall security risk is low, assuming the external libraries are trusted. Care should be taken to validate input URLs to prevent misuse, but this is standard practice.",
