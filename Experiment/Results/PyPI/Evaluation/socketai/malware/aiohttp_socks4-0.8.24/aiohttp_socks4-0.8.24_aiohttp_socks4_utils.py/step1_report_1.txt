  "purpose": "Establish proxy-based network connections using asyncio, supporting SOCKS5 proxies and customizable protocols.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() for proxy configuration, user-provided parameters (proxy_url, host, port, username, password).",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection() for establishing network connections with potentially untrusted socket data.",
  "flows": "Proxy parameters are parsed or taken from user input, used to create a proxy object, which then establishes a connection to the target host and port, passing the socket to asyncio connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated code. Use of third-party library 'python_socks' appears standard for proxy handling. No suspicious data exfiltration or system manipulation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two async functions for creating network connections via proxies. Proxy parameters are either directly provided or parsed from a URL, then used to instantiate a proxy object with 'python_socks'. The functions establish a socket connection through the proxy and return asyncio connection objects. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations. The code relies on standard libraries and common patterns for proxy handling and async networking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate proxy connection utility, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It securely manages connection setup through proxies, with proper parameter handling and no evident malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
