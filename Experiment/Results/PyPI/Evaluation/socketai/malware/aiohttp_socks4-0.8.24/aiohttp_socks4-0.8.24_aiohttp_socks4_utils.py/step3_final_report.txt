{
  "purpose": "Establishes proxy-based network connections asynchronously using the python_socks library, supporting SOCKS5 proxies with configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, host and port parameters, optional credentials, and environment variables (via proxy_url and input parameters).",
  "sinks": "The socket object used in asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection, which could potentially be exploited if proxy URLs or credentials are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy_url, host, port, credentials) are parsed and validated, then used to create a proxy object, which establishes a socket connection, then passed to asyncio connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Proxy URL parsing relies on external input but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. It validates essential parameters, parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects with python_socks, and connects via asyncio. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard libraries and patterns, with proper validation. Potential risks are limited to misuse of untrusted proxy URLs, which is typical in such utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the handling of external input but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for establishing proxy connections in asyncio environments. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score reflects typical concerns with untrusted input, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
