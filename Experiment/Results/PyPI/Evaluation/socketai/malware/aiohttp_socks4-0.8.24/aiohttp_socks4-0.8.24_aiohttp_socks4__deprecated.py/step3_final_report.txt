{
  "purpose": "A deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class wrapping an existing ProxyConnector, issuing deprecation warnings to guide users towards the newer ProxyConnector.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__), from_url class method, and import statements; no untrusted input or external data sources within this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems, no network activity, no untrusted data handling or leaks.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SocksConnector triggers warnings and delegates to the superclass; from_url method delegates to the superclass's method; no data or network flow occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; deprecation warning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an existing ProxyConnector, adding deprecation warnings for transition purposes. It defines SOCKS version constants, manages class inheritance, and delegates core functionality without performing any network operations or data processing. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present, and the code is clear and well-structured. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance status but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional wrapper with no security risks or malicious behavior. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
