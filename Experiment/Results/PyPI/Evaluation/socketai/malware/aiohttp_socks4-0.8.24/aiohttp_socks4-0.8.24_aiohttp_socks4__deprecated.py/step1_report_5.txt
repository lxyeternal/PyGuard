{
  "purpose": "Define a SocksConnector class for managing SOCKS proxy connections, including deprecation warnings for an older connector class.",
  "sources": "Import statements (warnings, python_socks, local connector module), class definitions, method parameters and internal logic.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flow to external systems or sensitive data leaks. No untrusted input handling beyond method parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'socks_ver' and 'url' flow into class initialization and factory method, but no risky data handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings suggests an update or transition; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code features. No obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy-related classes with deprecation notices and straightforward initialization logic. It imports standard proxy error classes, sets class constants, and offers a factory method. No input validation issues, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured component for proxy connection management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely manages proxy configurations and signals deprecation. The code is safe based on the provided fragment.",
