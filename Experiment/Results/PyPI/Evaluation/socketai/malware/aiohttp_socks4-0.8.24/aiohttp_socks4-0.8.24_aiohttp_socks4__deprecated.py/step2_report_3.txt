  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector with warnings.\n- Sources & Sinks: No data flows to external systems; mainly class setup and warnings.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; deprecation warning is standard.\n- Analysis: The code is a straightforward wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- Risk & Malware: Both scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing deprecation and proxy support.\n- Sources & Sinks: No data leaks or untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: Standard deprecation pattern, no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: No malicious intent, just a wrapper with warnings.\n- Scores: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 seem appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines a proxy connector with version constants and deprecation warning.\n- Sources & Sinks: No network or data operations; mainly class setup.\n- Anomalies: No hidden or obfuscated code; deprecation warning is standard.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, straightforward implementation.\n- Scores: Malware 0, securityRisk 0, consistent with benign code.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connector with deprecation warning.\n- Sources & Sinks: No data leaks or untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code; deprecation warnings are standard.\n- Analysis: Standard class inheritance and warnings.\n- Scores: Malware 0, securityRisk 0.1, appropriate.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar to others, managing SOCKS proxies with deprecation notices.\n- Sources & Sinks: No external data flow or network activity.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or secrets; deprecation is normal.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, safe code.\n- Scores: Malware 0, securityRisk 0, aligns with benign code.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, consistent with the code being a wrapper and deprecation notifier.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified because the code is a simple, well-structured wrapper with deprecation warnings, no data leaks, or suspicious activities.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, as the only concern might be the deprecated status, which isn't a security risk per se).\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe. No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
