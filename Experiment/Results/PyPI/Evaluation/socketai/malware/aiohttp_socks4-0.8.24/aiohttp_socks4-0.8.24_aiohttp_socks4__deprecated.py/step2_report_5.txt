  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, deprecated wrapper around a proxy connector class (`ProxyConnector`) supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.\n- No network activity, data handling, or untrusted input processing is present within this code.\n- The code issues deprecation warnings, which indicates maintenance considerations but not malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The imported modules and classes are standard for proxy configuration and error handling.\n- The flow involves class initialization, method delegation, and warning issuance, all typical for such utility code.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are apparent.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- Obfuscation scores are also 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n\n- The reports assign a very low security risk (~0.1), justified by the fact that this code is a configuration wrapper with no data leaks or network operations.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n\n- The scores given seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 or 1) reflect the reviewers' agreement on the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the deprecation warning, which suggests that this code is outdated. However, deprecation does not imply maliciousness.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code appears to be a standard, well-maintained component.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is appropriate given the context; no significant security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nBased on all evidence, this code fragment is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a straightforward, deprecated wrapper for proxy configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese align with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
