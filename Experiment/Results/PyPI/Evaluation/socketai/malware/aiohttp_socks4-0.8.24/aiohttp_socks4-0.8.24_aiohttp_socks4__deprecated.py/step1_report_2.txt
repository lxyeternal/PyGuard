{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SocksConnector class that wraps around a proxy connector, with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, and provides warning for deprecation.",
  "sources": "Imports warnings, proxy error classes, and a connector class; reads class and function definitions; reads initialization parameters and class methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up classes and methods without executing network or data operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning suggests awareness of outdated code. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines proxy type constants. It includes a deprecated class SocksConnector that extends ProxyConnector, issuing a warning on instantiation. The class initializes proxy types based on arguments and offers a method to instantiate from a URL. The module reassigns exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The code functions as a wrapper and notifier for proxy handling, with no evidence of security risks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper for proxy connection management with a deprecation warning. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. Overall, it appears safe and intended for proxy configuration purposes.",
