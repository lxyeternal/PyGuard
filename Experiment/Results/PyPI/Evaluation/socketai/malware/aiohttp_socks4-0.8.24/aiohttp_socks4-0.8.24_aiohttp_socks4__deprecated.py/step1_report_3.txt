{
  "purpose": "Defines a SocksConnector class for managing SOCKS proxy connections, including deprecation warning and version constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, python_socks, and local connector module; class and function definitions reading from parameters and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Super class constructor calls, method return statements, and warnings are the main actions; no untrusted input handling or data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SocksConnector calls __init__, which may invoke super().__init__ with parameters; from_url class method calls superclass method to parse URL.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic; deprecation warning usage is standard. No hidden or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a proxy connector with version constants and a deprecation warning function. The constructor adapts based on provided kwargs, and the class method delegates to a superclass. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity are evident. The imports and class structure are typical for proxy configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign proxy connector implementation with deprecation warnings. There is no indication of malicious intent, data theft, or security risks.",
