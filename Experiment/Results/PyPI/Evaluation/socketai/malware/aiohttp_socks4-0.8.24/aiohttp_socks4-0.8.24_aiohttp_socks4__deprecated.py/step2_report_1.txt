  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and the claims made.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a wrapper around an existing `ProxyConnector`, adding deprecation warnings.\n- It supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 via constants.\n- No network activity, data handling, or untrusted input processing occurs within this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The use of warnings indicates maintenance or transition status, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector wrapper.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No network or data leaks; mainly class setup and warnings.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; deprecation warning is standard.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code is straightforward, importing modules, defining constants, and wrapping a parent class.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware, security risk is low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecation warning, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code is a standard wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, deprecation warning is normal.\n- **Analysis:** The code is typical for proxy configuration, with no hidden issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data flow to external systems.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward class setup, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard proxy configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hidden or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's nature as a configuration wrapper with deprecation warnings.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warnings, which are non-security-related but indicate maintenance status)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured proxy connector wrapper with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.",
