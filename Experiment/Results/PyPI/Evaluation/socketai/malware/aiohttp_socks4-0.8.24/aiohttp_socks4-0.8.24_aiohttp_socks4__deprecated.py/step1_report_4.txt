{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, including deprecation warnings and proxy type management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for warnings, proxy-related exceptions, and the ProxyConnector class; class and function definitions that handle proxy configuration and instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the parent class ProxyConnector; use of warnings.warn; potential data flow through from_url method.",
  "flows": "The class constructor and from_url method invoke the parent class methods, passing configuration parameters; warnings are issued during class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of deprecation warnings suggests maintenance considerations but not malicious intent. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages proxy configuration via the SocksConnector class, handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, with a deprecation warning for an older connector. It imports necessary modules and exceptions, provides a class with initialization logic, and forwards calls to the superclass. No input sources or untrusted data flows are evident. The code uses warnings for deprecation notice and straightforward class inheritance without complex or suspicious operations. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purpose-driven for proxy configuration management.",
