{
  "purpose": "This code defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that wraps around an existing ProxyConnector, providing an interface for SOCKS5 and SOCKS4 proxies, and issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class initialization parameters, method arguments ('socks_ver', 'url', 'kwargs'), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file operations, or data transmissions are present; the code primarily sets up class structures and warnings.",
  "flows": "The flow involves initializing the SocksConnector class with parameters or URLs, issuing warnings, and delegating to the parent class's methods; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The use of warnings indicates deprecation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines constants for SOCKS versions, and implements a deprecated class that wraps a ProxyConnector, issuing warnings upon instantiation. It provides a method to create instances from URLs, again warning about deprecation. The code relies on external modules and does not contain any network operations or data handling within itself. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a proxy connector wrapper with deprecation notices. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard wrapper around a proxy connector with deprecation warnings. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, and the code is transparent and straightforward.",
