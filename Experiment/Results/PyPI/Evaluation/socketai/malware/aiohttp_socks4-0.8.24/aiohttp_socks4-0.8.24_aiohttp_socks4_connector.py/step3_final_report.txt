{
  "purpose": "Provides custom aiohttp TCP connectors supporting proxy chaining and URL-based proxy configuration, enabling network requests through proxies with optional DNS bypass.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy URL parsing), input proxy URLs, and external proxy libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connection establishment via proxies, including chained proxies, using the python_socks library.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URLs or parameters are parsed into proxy objects, which are used to connect to target hosts through the proxy chain, bypassing DNS resolution if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of NoResolver bypasses DNS, which could be exploited for privacy evasion but is a known pattern in proxy tools.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy handling with support for chaining, using external libraries and URL parsing. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The use of NoResolver could be exploited but is not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of backdoors or data leaks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects potential misuse of proxy configurations, which is reasonable given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured proxy connector implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low security risk score accounts for potential misuse but does not indicate inherent malicious intent.",
