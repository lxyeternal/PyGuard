  "purpose": "Implement custom proxy connectors for HTTP client sessions using SOCKS proxies and proxy chaining.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy URLs, user-provided host, port, username, password, and proxy chain configurations.",
  "sinks": "Proxy connection creation and network socket transport, which could potentially be exploited to redirect or intercept traffic.",
  "flows": "Parsing proxy URLs → creating proxy objects → connecting via proxies → returning network transports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the proxy handling is explicit. The code is standard for proxy connection setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for custom resolvers and proxy connectors using 'python_socks' and 'aiohttp', enabling the creation of single or chained proxy connections. It accepts proxy URLs and parameters, parses them, and establishes network connections through proxies. There are no indicators of malicious code such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system sabotage. The implementation appears to be straightforward proxy connection management, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily facilitates proxy connection setup and chaining. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. It appears to be legitimate, standard code for proxy handling with appropriate parameter management.",
