  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core code: custom aiohttp proxy connectors supporting single and chained proxies, with URL parsing, bypassing DNS resolution via NoResolver, and standard proxy handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`python_socks`, `aiohttp`) in a standard way.\n- The main potential concern is the use of `NoResolver`, which bypasses DNS resolution, possibly for privacy or evasion purposes. However, this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- The proxies are configured via URLs or parameters, with no embedded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify specific vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. They accurately describe the code's functionality, which appears legitimate.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No evident coding errors or logical flaws. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk ≈ 0.2, and confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Assigned as 0.2 in all reports. This reflects that, while the code itself is benign, its capability to route traffic through arbitrary proxies (including chained proxies and bypassing DNS) could be misused if malicious proxies are provided.  \n  *This is a reasonable score.*  \n  If the code is used with untrusted proxy URLs, it could facilitate malicious activities like man-in-the-middle attacks, traffic interception, or privacy violations. Therefore, a low but non-zero risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential for Higher Scores?\n\n- **Malware:** No, the code is not malicious.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No, code is clear.  \n- **Risk:** The risk is mainly due to misuse, not inherent maliciousness. Given that, 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Security Risk: **0.2** (consistent with the reports)  \n\n- **Overall assessment:**  \n  The code is a legitimate utility for proxy handling, with no malicious intent or supply chain issues. Its potential misuse depends on the trustworthiness of provided proxy URLs.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious code or payloads present.                         |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code.                                    |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2                 | Proxy configuration can be exploited if used maliciously, but inherent risk is low. |\n\n**Note:** No change from the report scores is necessary; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is legitimate and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk score appropriately reflects potential misuse, not inherent maliciousness.",
