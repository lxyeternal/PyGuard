{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not clearly read external input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations like network communication, file writing, or database access.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows identified; the code seems self-contained and does not process external untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behavior are visible. The code structure is straightforward; no obfuscated or overly complex patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations such as variable assignments, function definitions, and possibly data computations. No external data fetching, network connections, or file I/O points to untrusted sources. There are no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated logic. The code structure is conventional and does not exhibit typical malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected.",
