      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including system API calls, environment variable access, file and directory manipulations, and dynamic command execution. It is likely designed to perform covert malicious activities such as privilege escalation, system sabotage, or data exfiltration. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and should not be used in any environment without thorough dynamic analysis and source verification."
