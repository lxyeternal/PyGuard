      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the embedded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed stealthily. The setup script appears legitimate but is likely exploited as a vector for malicious payload delivery. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.85 and 0.9 respectively, and a high security risk score of 0.85. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious actions."
