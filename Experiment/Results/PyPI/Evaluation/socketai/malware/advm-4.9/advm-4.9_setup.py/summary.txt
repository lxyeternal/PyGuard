  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The use of stealth flags and error suppression strongly suggests malicious activity, such as remote code execution or payload download. The scores should reflect this high risk."
