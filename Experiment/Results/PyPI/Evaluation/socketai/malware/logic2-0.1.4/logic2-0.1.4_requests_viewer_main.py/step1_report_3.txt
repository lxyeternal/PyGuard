{
  "purpose": "The code fetches a URL or processes an object to display or handle web content such as HTML, images, or JSON responses.",
  "sources": "Input URL or object passed to the 'main' function, which is either a string or other object, potentially from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Requests made via 'requests.get', content type header accessed, web and image viewer functions invoked with the response object.",
  "flows": "Input source (URL or object) → HTTP request via requests.get → Content-Type header extraction → Conditional handling based on content type (web.view_request, image.view_request, js.view_request).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious obfuscation, straightforward request handling. No data leaks or privacy violations evident. The code relies on external modules for display.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts an input, determines if it's a URL or object, performs an HTTP GET request if URL, and dispatches the response to different viewers based on content type. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'requests' is standard, and no untrusted data is processed insecurely. No data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious network activity appears present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard web content retrieval and display functions with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.",
