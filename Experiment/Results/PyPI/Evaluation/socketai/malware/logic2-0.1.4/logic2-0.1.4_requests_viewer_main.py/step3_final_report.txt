  "purpose": "A content viewer utility that fetches and displays web content based on content type, supporting HTML, images, and JSON.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] for URL or object input, requests.get() for fetching URL content, headers['Content-Type'] for determining content type.",
  "sinks": "web.view_html(), web.view_tree(), web.view_request(), image.view_request(), js.view_request() functions for displaying content.",
  "flows": "Input source (URL or object) -> requests.get() (if URL) -> Content-Type header -> appropriate view function based on content type.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of 'requests_viewer.js' as a Python module, given the '.js' extension; no input validation beyond content type check.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward content viewer that fetches data from a URL or processes an object, then displays it based on the content type. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The import of a '.js' file as a module is unconventional but not malicious. The code relies on external modules for display, which are assumed benign. No evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The content type handling is standard, and the logic is simple and clear. The main potential concern is the module import naming, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign content viewer utility with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified by the unconventional module import and lack of input validation, which is typical for such scripts. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
