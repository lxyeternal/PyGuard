{
  "purpose": "The code fetches data from a provided URL or local object and displays it using appropriate viewer modules based on content type.",
  "sources": "Input URL or object passed to main(), sys.argv[1], or data fetched via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "web.view_html(), web.view_tree(), web.view_request(), image.view_request(), js.view_request() functions that process data for display",
  "flows": "Input source (URL or object) -> requests.get() -> Content-Type header -> appropriate view function based on content type",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'requests_viewer.js as js' suggests possible code execution or obfuscation, but it appears to be a module import; no malicious code detected here. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads modules for viewing different content types, fetching data via requests. The flow is straightforward: fetch data, determine content type, and display accordingly. No input sanitization or validation beyond checking content type, but typical for display scripts. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code relies on external modules for displaying content, which are not provided here; assuming they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data fetching and display functions with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code, nor does it perform any malicious actions. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility for viewing content from URLs or objects.",
