  "conclusion": "The code is a benign content viewer utility with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified by the unconventional module import and lack of input validation, which is typical for such scripts. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
