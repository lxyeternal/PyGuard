{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility that fetches a URL or processes an object for viewing HTML, images, or JSON content via different modules.",
  "sources": "Input URL or object passed as a command-line argument or function parameter; data fetched via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "calls to web.view_html, web.view_tree, web.view_request, image.view_request, js.view_request",
  "flows": "Input source (URL or object) -> requests.get() -> Content-Type header -> specific view functions based on content type",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'requests_viewer.js' imported as 'js' and 'requests_viewer.image' as 'image' suggests reliance on local modules; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles HTTP GET requests to a URL or processes an object for viewing. It distinguishes content types based on headers and calls appropriate viewing functions. The import statements include a try-except block for importing web modules, ensuring compatibility. No suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modifications is present. All data flows seem to be confined within expected behavior for a content viewer. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external connections beyond the request are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a safe content viewer utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate tasks related to content retrieval and display without suspicious activities.",
