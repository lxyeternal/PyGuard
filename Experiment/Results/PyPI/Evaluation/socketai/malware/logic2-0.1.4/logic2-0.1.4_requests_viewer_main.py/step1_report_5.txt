{
  "purpose": "The script fetches a URL or object, determines its content type, and displays it using different viewer modules.",
  "sources": "Input URL or object from sys.argv or function argument, request headers from HTTP response",
  "sinks": "requests.get call, web.view_html, web.view_tree, web.view_request, image.view_request, js.view_request",
  "flows": "Input source -> requests.get -> response headers -> content type check -> appropriate viewer functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of import requests_viewer.js as js and requests_viewer.image as image may be harmless, but potential for malicious module misuse exists. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code relies on standard requests and module calls without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs URL fetching and content display based on content type. It uses standard libraries and well-defined functions to handle different content types. No suspicious or malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic is present. The import statements for viewer modules are straightforward, and the request handling follows typical patterns. The only potential concern could be if any of the viewer modules perform malicious actions internally, but that cannot be determined from this code alone. Overall, the code appears to be benign, intended for viewing web content.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a web content viewer with no evident malicious intent. It correctly handles different content types and uses standard libraries. No suspicious behaviors or malware indications are observed.",
