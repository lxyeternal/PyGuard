  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for a Python project named 'logic2'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for versioning and package setup parameters; it also imports modules.",
  "sinks": "The code executes dynamically decoded and compiled code via exec, which may run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Static package metadata flows normally, but the decoded code is executed at runtime, representing a potential malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__, base64 decoding, compile, and exec functions to run dynamically generated code. The presence of obfuscated code and dynamic execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines version info, then executes obfuscated code that decodes a base64 string, compiles it, and runs it with exec. The decoded code imports modules, makes an HTTP request to a specified URL, and reads the response. This behavior suggests the code attempts to fetch and execute additional code at runtime, which is often a sign of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The setup() call appears normal except for the prior dynamic execution. The presence of __import__ and base64 decoding indicates obfuscation intended to hide malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic execution that could run arbitrary code from an external source, representing a high security risk. It is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could execute malicious payloads from the decoded URL. The setup configuration itself appears standard but is overshadowed by the obfuscated code that runs before the package setup.",
