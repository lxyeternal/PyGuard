  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for the 'logic2' package, defining version, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version variables, base64-encoded code execution, package discovery, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded base64 code; network requests via 'requests' (if used); package setup routines.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded code is executed via exec, which may run arbitrary code; version info is constructed from variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code executed dynamically via base64 decoding and exec; use of compile for code execution; no clear benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with defining version info and printing a newline. It then imports setup tools. The critical part is the base64 string, which, when decoded, is compiled and executed dynamically. This decoded code imports 'tempfile' and 'NamedTemporaryFile', then reads from a URL and performs an eval on its contents, potentially executing arbitrary code fetched over the network. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The setup() function appears standard, but the embedded code's malicious nature significantly outweighs the benign setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code that fetches and evaluates remote content, indicating malicious behavior. The setup configuration itself appears standard, but the embedded code poses a serious security risk.",
