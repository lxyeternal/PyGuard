{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package named 'logic2', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information, version details, and dependencies; it also includes a base64-encoded string that is executed dynamically.",
  "sinks": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and executed, which could lead to malicious behavior such as executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload and executes it via exec, which could potentially run malicious code; other parts involve standard setup data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code through base64 decoding and dynamic execution; the encoded payload may contain malicious code. The code also includes a typo in 'beautifulsoup4' (misspelled as 'beatifulsoup4').",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard package setup metadata, which is normal. However, it then imports 'base64' and decodes a base64 string that is immediately executed via exec, which is a common tactic to hide malicious code. The base64 payload decodes to code that imports 'tempfile', 'NamedTemporaryFile', and makes HTTP requests to an external IP address, and uses 'exec' on decoded data. Such behavior suggests malicious intent, such as downloading and executing remote code or exfiltrating data. The rest of the script appears typical for a setup.py file but is overshadowed by the malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior hidden within a base64-encoded payload that is executed at runtime. This is a serious security concern, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent and risk.",
