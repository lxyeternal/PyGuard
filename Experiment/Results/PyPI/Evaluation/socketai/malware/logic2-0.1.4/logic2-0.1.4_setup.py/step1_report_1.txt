  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'logic2' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies, package information, and executes dynamically decoded and compiled code embedded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic execution of decoded code is a potential sink where malicious payload could be executed.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded code is compiled and executed at runtime, which could execute malicious code if embedded in the base64 payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding, compilation, and execution of code at runtime is unusual and suspicious, especially since it decodes an encoded payload that appears to be an obfuscated or hidden script.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining version variables and printing a newline. It then imports setup tools for packaging. The critical part is a base64-encoded string that is decoded, compiled, and executed dynamically using exec. This payload likely contains additional malicious or obfuscated code. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration, which appears normal. However, the embedded code execution raises significant suspicion, as it could be used to run malicious code during package installation or import. The code does not directly harm the system but uses obfuscation techniques that are typical for malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes obfuscated code execution through base64 decoding, compilation, and exec, which is highly suspicious. This pattern is common in malicious scripts attempting to hide harmful payloads. The rest of the setup configuration appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the embedded malicious payload. Overall, this package likely contains malicious behavior, possibly designed to execute hidden code during installation or import.",
