  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec, and the standard setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "The exec call executing dynamically decoded code; package configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded code executes via exec, then proceeds to define package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated code block decoded from base64 and executed dynamically; misspelling of 'beautifulsoup4' as 'beatifulsoup4'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines version info. It then executes a dynamically decoded and compiled Python script that imports modules and makes an HTTP request. This code is obfuscated, decoded from base64, and executed at runtime, which is suspicious. The setup() function itself appears standard, but the execution of external code raises security concerns. The misspelled dependency 'beatifulsoup4' could cause installation issues but not necessarily malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated code execution that downloads and runs code from an external URL, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The rest of the setup script is standard, but the dynamic code execution significantly elevates the risk profile.",
