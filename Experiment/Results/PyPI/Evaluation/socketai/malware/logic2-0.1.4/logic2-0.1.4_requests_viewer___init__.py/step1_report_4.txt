{
  "purpose": "Initialize the 'requests_viewer' package and import its main and web functionalities, with a conditional import for limited HTML view capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'requests_viewer.main' and 'requests_viewer.web', and the optional import of 'lxml.html'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; only module imports and a print statement for import failure.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; the code primarily sets up module imports and extends a class with a method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The only notable point is the dynamic assignment of 'view' to 'HtmlElement', which is a typical extension point for the library.",
  "analysis": "The code sets module metadata, imports core functions from within the package, and attempts to extend the 'lxml.html.HtmlElement' class with a 'view' method if 'lxml' is available. The import of 'lxml.html' and the assignment 'lxml.html.HtmlElement.view = view_tree' is a common way to add custom methods to library classes. The try-except block ensures graceful degradation if 'lxml' is not installed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script that defines the package's purpose, imports necessary components, and extends a class with a custom view method. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
