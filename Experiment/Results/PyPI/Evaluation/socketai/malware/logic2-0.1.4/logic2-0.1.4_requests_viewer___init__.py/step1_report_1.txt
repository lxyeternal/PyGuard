{
  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and import core functionalities for requests viewing and web visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests_viewer.main and requests_viewer.web modules, as well as optional import of lxml.html.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the module, attempts to extend lxml.html.HtmlElement with a view method, but does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of lxml.html and extension of its HtmlElement class is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata, imports core modules, and attempts to enhance lxml.html functionality with a custom view method. The try-except block ensures functionality degrades gracefully if lxml is not installed. There are no apparent input sources or sinks, and no processing of untrusted data or external network activity is evident. The code appears to be for visualization purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily defines package metadata and conditionally extends a library class for visualization. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and intended for user interface enhancement.",
