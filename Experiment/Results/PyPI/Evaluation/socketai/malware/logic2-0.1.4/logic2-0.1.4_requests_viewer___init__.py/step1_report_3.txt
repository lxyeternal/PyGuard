{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports functions for request viewing and web visualization within the requests_viewer project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions from requests_viewer.main and requests_viewer.web, as well as the optional import of lxml.html.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no handling of untrusted data, user input, or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up module structure and optional functionality, no data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute assignment to lxml.html.HtmlElement.view = view_tree, which could be used to modify behavior of external library elements. No other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes module metadata (__project__, __version__) and imports specific functions from the requests_viewer package. It attempts to import optional web visualization functions and the lxml.html module. If lxml is available, it assigns the view_tree function to the HtmlElement.view attribute, potentially customizing or extending lxml's HTML element behavior. There are no sources of untrusted data, no processing of user input, and no external network interactions or sensitive data handling observed. The code does not contain any malicious behavior or malicious intent. The dynamic modification of lxml objects is unusual but not inherently malicious; it appears intended for extending functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with optional enhancements for web visualization. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic attribute assignment to an external library, which is not suspicious in context.",
