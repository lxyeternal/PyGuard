  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code primarily performs package setup: defining metadata, importing core modules, and extending the lxml.html.HtmlElement class with a view method if lxml is available.\n- There are no evident data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted input, network activity, or data processing.\n- The dynamic modification of lxml.html.HtmlElement is unusual but not inherently malicious; it is a common extension technique.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The exception handling ensures graceful degradation if dependencies are missing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, mainly setup and extension code.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or harmful behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No input handling, data processing, or network operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to the dynamic class extension, which is not inherently risky.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only notable \"anomaly\" is the dynamic assignment `lxml.html.HtmlElement.view = view_tree`. While unusual, this is a common pattern for extending library classes and not suspicious.\n- The slight variation in the security risk score (some reports assign 0.1) seems to be an overly cautious acknowledgment of the dynamic modification, but it remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally reasonable. Given the benign analysis, I would suggest:\n  - **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Security risk score:** 0, since no actual security issues are present. The small risk score of 0.1 could be reduced to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis: the code is a standard setup script with a minor extension to a third-party library, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are mostly appropriate, but I recommend setting the security risk score to 0 for clarity, as no actual risks are evident. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
