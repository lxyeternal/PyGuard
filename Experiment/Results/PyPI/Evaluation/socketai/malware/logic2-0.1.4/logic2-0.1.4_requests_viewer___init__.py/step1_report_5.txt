{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package called 'requests_viewer' with functions for viewing HTTP request structures and web tree visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from 'requests_viewer.main' and 'requests_viewer.web', which are likely used for main functionality and web visualization respectively.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; however, functions imported or used may process or display data, but no untrusted data handling or output is visible.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to a conditional import of 'lxml.html' and assigns a new method to 'HtmlElement.view' if import succeeds.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or perform network operations.",
  "analysis": "The script sets module-level metadata, imports core functions, and conditionally extends 'lxml.html.HtmlElement' with a custom view method. It gracefully handles missing dependencies with a print statement. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical setup for a visualization or request inspection tool, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script for a request visualization package. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose is to initialize the package and extend the functionality of 'lxml.html' if available, with no suspicious elements present.",
