  "purpose": "Setup and extend the requests_viewer package, including optional enhancement of lxml.html.HtmlElement with a custom view method.",
  "sources": "Package metadata definitions, module imports, conditional import of lxml.html and extension of HtmlElement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to optional extension of lxml.html.HtmlElement with view_tree, without involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic assignment of view method to lxml.html.HtmlElement, which is unusual but a common extension pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata, imports core modules, and conditionally extends lxml.html.HtmlElement with a view method via view_tree. There are no data sources or sinks involving untrusted input, nor any network activity. The dynamic extension is somewhat unusual but standard in Python for customizing third-party libraries. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is detected. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the dynamic class extension, which is benign but slightly unusual. The code's structure and behavior are straightforward, with no obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The overall assessment is that the code is benign, with minimal security concern, and the scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script that extends a third-party library for visualization purposes. It does not process untrusted data or perform malicious actions. The small risk score reflects the unusual dynamic extension but does not indicate any threat. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
