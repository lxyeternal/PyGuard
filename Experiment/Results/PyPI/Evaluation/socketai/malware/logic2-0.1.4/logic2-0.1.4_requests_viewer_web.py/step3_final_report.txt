  "purpose": "Utilities for fetching, parsing, diffing, and visualizing HTML content, including diff comparisons and rendering in a browser.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to fetch web pages, reading local HTML files, input HTML strings, and DOM traversal.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open() to display HTML content in the default browser, temporary files for visualization.",
  "flows": "Fetch or read HTML -> parse and process DOM -> generate diff or visualization -> open in browser or display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of time.sleep() and webbrowser.open() are benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries for HTML parsing and diffing, performs benign operations for visualization, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. No network activity beyond standard requests, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The functions serve legitimate purposes, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for HTML diffing and visualization with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit obfuscation or malware. The current low risk and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
