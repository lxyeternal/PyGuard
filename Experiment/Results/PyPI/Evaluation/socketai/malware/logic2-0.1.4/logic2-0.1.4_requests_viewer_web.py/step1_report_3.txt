{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for fetching, parsing, and visualizing HTML content, including diff visualization and DOM manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from URLs via requests, local files, and function parameters such as 'html' strings and nodes.",
  "sinks": "Web browser is invoked to display HTML content via 'webbrowser.open'; local files are created temporarily for viewing.",
  "flows": "HTML content is fetched or read from files, parsed into DOM trees, manipulated, converted to strings, and displayed via webbrowser.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports multiple modules without validation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling are evident; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly for visualizing HTML differences and rendering HTML content in a browser. It fetches data from URLs or files, parses with lxml, and creates temp files for display. No external or untrusted data is processed insecurely; the webbrowser is used solely for display purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections beyond HTTP GET, code injection, or hidden backdoors, is present. Usage of requests with a common user-agent is standard; temp files are used securely, and no hardcoded secrets are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for HTML diff visualization and DOM manipulation with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
