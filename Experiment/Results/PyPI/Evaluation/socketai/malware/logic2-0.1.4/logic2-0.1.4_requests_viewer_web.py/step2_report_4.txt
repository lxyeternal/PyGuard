  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The report states the code is primarily for HTML visualization and diffing, with no malicious behavior detected. The code matches the description, and no suspicious functions or network activity beyond standard requests are observed.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The report is consistent and accurate. It correctly notes the benign use of `requests`, `webbrowser`, and temporary files. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable given the benign functions, though some might argue even lower risk.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Overall, scores seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None here; all scores are low, reflecting benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Same as above; no malicious behavior detected. The functions are utility-based, and the use of `webbrowser.open()` is for visualization.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No significant flaws. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report is accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Similar conclusion; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis is consistent.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Overall:**  \n  No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code performs web requests, HTML parsing, diffing, and visualization, all benign.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given the functions involved.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code is consistent with previous reports, performing HTML fetching, parsing, and visualization.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The report correctly notes the benign nature.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — even lower, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to standard web requests and browser interactions, which are typical for visualization tools.\n\n**Note:** The use of `time.sleep()` and `webbrowser.open()` is benign in this context, intended for user experience, not malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate HTML visualization and diffing utility with no malware or security risks.",
