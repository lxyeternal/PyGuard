{
  "purpose": "The function 'view_request' is designed to display the text content of an HTTP response in a web browser by writing it to a temporary file and opening it.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameter 'r', specifically 'r.text', which is assumed to be data from an HTTP response object.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a temporary file and then opens this file in a web browser using 'webbrowser.open'.",
  "flows": "The data flows from 'r.text' (source) into a temporary file, then into the web browser via the file URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity beyond opening a local file in the web browser. The use of 'time.sleep(1)' appears to be a delay and does not pose a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file and writes the response text into it, then opens this file in the default web browser. It appears to be a benign utility for viewing response content. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The process relies solely on standard library functions and a common approach for displaying HTML content locally.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple viewer for response text content, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
