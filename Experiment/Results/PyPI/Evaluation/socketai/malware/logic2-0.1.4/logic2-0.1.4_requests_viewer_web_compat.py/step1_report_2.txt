{
  "purpose": "To display the response content of an HTTP request in a web browser by creating a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The function reads data from the 'r.text' attribute, which is expected to be a string containing HTTP response content.",
  "sinks": "The code opens a temporary file with the webbrowser module, which could potentially lead to displaying untrusted content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'r.text' (source) to the temporary file, then to the web browser (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file, writes the HTTP response text into it, and then opens it in the default web browser. The process involves reading input from 'r.text' and displaying it without processing or sanitization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code execution, or data theft. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely to display HTTP response content in a web browser. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet. It is a benign utility with no security concerns.",
