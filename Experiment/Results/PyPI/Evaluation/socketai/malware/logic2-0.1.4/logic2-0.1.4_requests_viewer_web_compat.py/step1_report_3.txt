{
  "purpose": "Display the content of an HTTP response in the default web browser by writing it to a temporary file.",
  "sources": "Reads 'r.text' from an input parameter, which is presumably an HTTP response object.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'webbrowser.open' to open the temporary file containing response text.",
  "flows": "Reads response text -> writes to temp file -> opens in browser",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network connections outside the browser invocation, no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file, writes the provided response text into it, and opens it in the default web browser. It relies on the 'r' object having a 'text' attribute, typically from an HTTP response. The use of 'webbrowser.open' to display content is benign. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The sleep delay appears to allow the browser to load the page. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward utility for rendering response content in a browser.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying HTTP response content in a web browser. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
