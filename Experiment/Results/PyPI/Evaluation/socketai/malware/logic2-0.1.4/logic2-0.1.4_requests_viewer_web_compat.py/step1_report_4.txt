{
  "purpose": "Render the response text in a temporary HTML file and open it in a web browser for viewing.",
  "sources": "Reads 'r.text' from the input parameter.",
  "sinks": "Opens a local file in the web browser using 'webbrowser.open'.",
  "flows": "Input 'r.text' flows into a temporary file which is then opened in the web browser.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a temporary file and web browser to display data; no explicit input validation or sanitization observed. No malicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The function creates a temporary file in write mode, writes the 'r.text' content into it, then opens this file in the default web browser. It includes a sleep delay to possibly ensure the browser has time to load. No external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration is apparent. The code simply displays content received via 'r.text'. While it could be exploited if 'r.text' contains malicious HTML/JavaScript, this is typical behavior for rendering content and does not constitute malware by itself. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose appears to be rendering and displaying response content in a web browser. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs standard operations with minimal security risk, assuming the input 'r.text' is from a trusted source or sanitized as needed.",
