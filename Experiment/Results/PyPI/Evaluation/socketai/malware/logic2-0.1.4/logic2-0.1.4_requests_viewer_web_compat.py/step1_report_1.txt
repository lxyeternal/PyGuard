  "purpose": "Display the response content in a temporary file by opening it in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads from r.text (likely an input response object containing text data).",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open potentially executes code in the browser, indirectly displaying the data.",
  "flows": "Input data r.text is written to a temporary file, then opened in a web browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward use of tempfile, time, and webbrowser modules.",
  "analysis": "The function creates a temporary file, writes r.text to it, and opens it in a web browser. This can be used benignly for displaying content. However, if r.text contains malicious code or scripts, opening it in a browser could execute malicious scripts or cause undesired behavior. The code does not sanitize or validate the content before opening. The use of tempfile is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected beyond potential risks associated with rendering untrusted content in a browser.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to display text content in a web browser via a temporary file. While not inherently malicious, it could be exploited if r.text contains malicious scripts. There is no malicious intent or backdoor behavior present in the code itself, but caution should be exercised when displaying untrusted content.",
