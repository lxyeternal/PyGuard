      "conclusion": "The package contains heavily obfuscated code that executes remote payloads during installation or import, representing a serious security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified by the embedded code's behavior. This package should be considered malicious or compromised, and caution is advised in its use."

The main security concern is rendering untrusted `r.text`, which could execute malicious scripts in the browser. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score reflecting potential content risks. No significant revisions are necessary unless stricter sanitization is enforced."

Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified by the unconventional module import and lack of input validation, which is typical for such scripts. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

The minimal security risk stems from potential data exposure if sensitive information is displayed, but this is not a security flaw. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and security risk score at approximately 0.1, reflecting low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
