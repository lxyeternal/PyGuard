{
  "purpose": "The code formats JSON data into HTML and opens it in a web browser for viewing.",
  "sources": "The function r.json() reads data from an HTTP response object 'r'.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open() call outputs a local HTML file to the user's default browser.",
  "flows": "Data from r.json() is converted to a formatted JSON string, wrapped in HTML, written to a temp file, then opened in a browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution. Use of webbrowser and tempfile is benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a response object 'r', extracts JSON data via r.json(), converts it into a pretty-printed JSON string, wraps it in a simple HTML structure, writes it to a temporary file, and opens it in the user's default web browser. This flow is straightforward, with no input validation or external network activity beyond the initial response. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The use of standard library functions and the absence of suspicious behaviors suggest this code is intended solely for user-friendly JSON display.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for visualizing JSON responses in a web browser. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
