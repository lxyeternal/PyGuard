  "purpose": "The code formats JSON data into an HTML view and opens it in a web browser for display.",
  "sources": "The code reads JSON data from a response object in the view_request function via r.json().",
  "sinks": "The code writes an HTML file to a temporary location and opens it with the default web browser using webbrowser.open().",
  "flows": "Data flows from r.json() to JSON.stringify(), then to HTML wrapping, then to a temporary file, and finally to a web browser for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of tempfile and webbrowser is standard for viewing data. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to convert JSON data into an HTML format for visualization. The view_request function serializes JSON data from a response object, writes it to a temporary HTML file with styling, and opens it in the default web browser. The use of tempfile and webbrowser modules are common and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears solely intended for debugging or data visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on visualizing JSON responses via a web browser, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
