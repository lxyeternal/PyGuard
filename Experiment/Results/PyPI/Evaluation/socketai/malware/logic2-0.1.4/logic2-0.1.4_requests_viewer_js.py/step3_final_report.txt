  "purpose": "Visualize JSON data from response object 'r' in a web browser by wrapping it in HTML.",
  "sources": "r.json() method to obtain JSON data",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open() to display the generated HTML file",
  "flows": "r.json() -> json.dumps() -> wrap_json_into_html() -> write to tempfile -> webbrowser.open()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code extracts JSON data from an object 'r', serializes it into a formatted string, embeds it into a minimal HTML template, writes it to a temporary file, and opens it in the default web browser. It uses standard libraries and performs benign operations. No network activity beyond 'r.json()' occurs. The only potential concern is the display of sensitive data if misused, but this does not constitute malicious activity. The use of 'time.sleep(1)' is unnecessary but harmless. No vulnerabilities or malicious code are present. The code's purpose appears solely for visualization or debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for visualizing JSON data with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The minimal security risk stems from potential data exposure if sensitive information is displayed, but this is not a security flaw. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and security risk score at approximately 0.1, reflecting low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
