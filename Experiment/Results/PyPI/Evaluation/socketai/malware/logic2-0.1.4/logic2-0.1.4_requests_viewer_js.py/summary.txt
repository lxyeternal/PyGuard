  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for visualizing JSON data with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The minimal security risk stems from potential data exposure if sensitive information is displayed, but this is not a security flaw. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and security risk score at approximately 0.1, reflecting low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
