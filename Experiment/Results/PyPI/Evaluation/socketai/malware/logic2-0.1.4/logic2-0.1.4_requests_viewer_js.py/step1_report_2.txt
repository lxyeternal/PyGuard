  "purpose": "The code is designed to display JSON responses in an HTML format within a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from a response object via r.json().",
  "sinks": "Outputs an HTML file and opens it in a web browser using webbrowser.open().",
  "flows": "Extracts JSON data from r.json(), converts it to a formatted string, writes it to a temporary HTML file, and opens it in a web browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file operations, or insecure practices. Use of time.sleep() appears unnecessary but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to wrap JSON data into simple HTML, then another function to serialize a JSON response, save it as a temporary HTML file, and display it in the user's default web browser. No external data sources, no malicious network activity, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. The use of tempfile for temporary file creation and webbrowser for display are standard operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for user-friendly visualization of JSON data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
