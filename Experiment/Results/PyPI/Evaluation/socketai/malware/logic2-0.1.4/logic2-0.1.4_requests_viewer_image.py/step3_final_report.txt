  "purpose": "A utility to display images embedded in HTTP response content by encoding the data in base64 and rendering it in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads 'Content-Type' from 'r.headers' and 'r.content' from the HTTP response object.",
  "sinks": "Embeds base64-encoded content into HTML and opens it via the web browser.",
  "flows": "Extracts 'Content-Type' and 'r.content', encodes content, embeds into HTML, writes to a temporary file, and opens in browser.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of validation or sanitization of 'Content-Type' and 'r.content'; potential for rendering malicious content if 'r' is untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward image viewer utility that encodes response content and displays it in a browser. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The primary concern is the rendering of untrusted content, which could exploit browser vulnerabilities, but this is inherent to any content rendering process. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent suggest it is safe when used with trusted data sources. Minor security risk exists if 'r' contains malicious content, but this is outside the code's direct control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying images from HTTP responses. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects potential issues if 'r' is untrusted, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
