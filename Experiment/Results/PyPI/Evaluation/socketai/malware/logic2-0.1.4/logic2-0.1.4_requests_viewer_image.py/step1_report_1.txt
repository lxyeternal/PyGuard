{
  "purpose": "The code generates an HTML page displaying an image encoded in base64 and opens it in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Reads 'Content-Type' from the 'r.headers' and 'r.content' (likely an HTTP response object).",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open() function that opens the generated HTML file, potentially executing embedded content.",
  "flows": "Extracts content type and content from the response, encodes the content in base64, embeds it in HTML, and opens it in a browser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, and no unusual obfuscation present. The code simply renders and displays image data.",
  "analysis": "The code reads image data and content type from an HTTP response object, encodes the image in base64, creates an HTML wrapper, saves it temporarily, and opens it in a web browser. There are no evident security issues such as code injection or data exfiltration. The use of webbrowser.open() on local files is standard for displaying images. No hidden or malicious behavior is observed. The code does not perform any network connections besides opening the local HTML file, nor does it execute any untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for displaying images from HTTP responses in a web browser. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
