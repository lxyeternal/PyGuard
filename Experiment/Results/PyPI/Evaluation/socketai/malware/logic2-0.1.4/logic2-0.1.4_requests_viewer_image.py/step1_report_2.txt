  "purpose": "Render and display an image embedded in HTML from a web request response.",
  "sources": "Reading response headers ('Content-Type') and response content ('r.content') from an HTTP response object.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a temporary HTML file, opening the file in a web browser.",
  "flows": "Response content is base64-encoded and embedded into HTML, then saved and opened in a browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The code directly uses response data for display.",
  "analysis": "The code takes an HTTP response object 'r', encodes its content in base64, embeds it in a simple HTML image tag with the specified content type, writes this HTML to a temporary file, and opens it in a web browser. The process appears straightforward for displaying images. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of webbrowser and tempfile modules is standard and safe in this context. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for rendering images from HTTP responses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
