{
  "purpose": "A simple test script invoking the 'main' function from 'requests_viewer.main' with a specific URL to perform an integration test.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL input from a hardcoded string in the 'main' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function likely performs an HTTP request to the provided URL, which is a sink for network activity.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded URL in 'main()' call -> 'main()' function -> network request to the URL.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious patterns. Commented-out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard integration test that calls 'main()' with a trusted URL. It performs an external network request during testing but contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The lack of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads indicates a benign purpose. The network activity is typical for testing package functionality. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with this assessment. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward integration test with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
