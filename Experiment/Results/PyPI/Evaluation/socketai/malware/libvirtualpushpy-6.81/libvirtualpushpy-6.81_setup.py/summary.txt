  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The package should be flagged and investigated further."
