      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands during package setup, with red flags such as obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL comments. These indicators suggest malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. Further decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended before trusting this package."
