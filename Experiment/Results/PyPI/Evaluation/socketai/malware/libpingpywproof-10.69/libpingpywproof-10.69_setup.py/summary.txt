  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution and external URL contact. The silent error handling further conceals potential malicious operations. Scores of approximately 0.8 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriate. It warrants treating this package as potentially malicious pending further payload analysis."
