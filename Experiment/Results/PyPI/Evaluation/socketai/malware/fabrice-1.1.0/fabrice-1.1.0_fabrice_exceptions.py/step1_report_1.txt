  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, specifically for handling no-operation scenarios, group errors, and environment configuration issues.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. These classes are used for specific error handling scenarios and do not include any executable logic or data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The comments suggest potential refactoring or relocation, but this is unrelated to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger application's error handling framework.",
