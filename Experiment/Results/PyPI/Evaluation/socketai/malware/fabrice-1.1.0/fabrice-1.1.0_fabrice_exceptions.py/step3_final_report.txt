  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task management and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data processing, or external interactions; comments suggest refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of straightforward class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings and comments. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
