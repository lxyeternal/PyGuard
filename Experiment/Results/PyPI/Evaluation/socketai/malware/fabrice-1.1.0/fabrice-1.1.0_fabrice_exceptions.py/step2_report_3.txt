  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. The comments suggest potential refactoring, but nothing indicates malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as part of an error handling framework. They do not identify any logical errors or security flaws. This assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   \n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely structural and contains no executable or malicious elements, higher risk scores are unjustified. The current scores of zero are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they simply describe the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not process data, interact with external systems, or contain any obfuscation or malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code poses no security risk and does not exhibit malware or obfuscation. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
