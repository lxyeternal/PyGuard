{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application, likely related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read in this code; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs, as there are only class definitions and no executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The comments suggest potential code organization refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and comments. No input reading, data handling, or external calls are present. The classes are straightforward and do not include any dynamic execution, hidden behaviors, or security issues. The comments hint at future code restructuring but do not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code appears purely structural without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines basic exception classes used for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project for task or environment management. There are no indicators of security concerns or malicious intent.",
