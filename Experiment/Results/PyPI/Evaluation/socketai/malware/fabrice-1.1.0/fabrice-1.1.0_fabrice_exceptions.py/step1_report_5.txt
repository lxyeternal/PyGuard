  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Code defines exception classes; no external data input or reading operations.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions with no external data input, network communication, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The comments and class structure are straightforward and typical for exception handling in Python. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is safe and standard in design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns.",
