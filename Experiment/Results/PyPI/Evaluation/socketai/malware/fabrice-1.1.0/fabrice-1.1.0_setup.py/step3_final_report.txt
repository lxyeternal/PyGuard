  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project, configuring package discovery, version retrieval, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem directories, version file '_version.py', README file.",
  "sinks": "exec() call on '_version.py' to obtain version information.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary naming; version info read via exec() from '_version.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local version file without validation; standard in setup scripts but potentially risky if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: environment-based package selection, reading version info via exec(), and configuring package metadata. The exec() call is a known pattern but can be exploited if '_version.py' is malicious. No network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable and directory checks are straightforward and do not introduce security issues. The use of exec() warrants caution but is acceptable if the version file is trusted. The overall structure is clear and standard, with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with a minor security risk associated with executing '_version.py'. No malicious behavior or malware is detected. The low malware score (0) and security risk score (0.2) are appropriate, assuming the version file is secure. Overall, the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
