  "purpose": "This code contains only import statements from internal modules, serving as a module initializer or API exposure point.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '# flake8: noqa' comment is benign; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements, typical for package setup. No dynamic execution, network activity, or external data processing is involved. All signals indicate benign intent. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears to be an overestimation; given the code's simplicity, it should be adjusted to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores should reflect a zero risk level.",
