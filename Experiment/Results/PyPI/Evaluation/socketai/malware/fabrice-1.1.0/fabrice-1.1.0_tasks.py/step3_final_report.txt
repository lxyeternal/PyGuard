  "purpose": "Automation tasks for packaging, testing, releasing, and documentation workflows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded credentials (e.g., 'sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'admin', 'localghost', 'mypass'), sys.path modifications, configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands (`c.run`), environment modifications, connection setups, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Credentials and secrets flow into command executions, environment configs, and connection parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded secrets, sys.path manipulations, environment variable handling, embedded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code contains no malicious payloads or malware. The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets and insecure environment handling, which could lead to credential leakage if the code is exposed. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The environment variable manipulations and embedded secrets are typical of insecure automation scripts but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an automation script with significant security risks due to hardcoded secrets and environment handling. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The security risk score should be high (~0.75), consistent with the presence of sensitive information embedded in the code.",
