  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed covertly during setup, indicating malicious intent. The broad exception handling and hidden execution increase the risk of undetected malicious activity. The high scores assigned are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
