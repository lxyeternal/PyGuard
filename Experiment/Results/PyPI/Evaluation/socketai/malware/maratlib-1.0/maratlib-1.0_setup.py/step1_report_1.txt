  "purpose": "Obfuscated code designed to evaluate dynamically constructed strings, possibly to hide malicious intent or evade detection, and a setup script for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, input strings in variables, and the eval() function with dynamically reconstructed code.",
  "sinks": "eval() functions which execute code constructed from obfuscated strings, potentially untrusted or malicious code.",
  "flows": "Strings are deobfuscated via custom functions (l111ll1l_lol_, l1ll1ll11_lol_) which manipulate the code, then passed to eval() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive obfuscation using character shifting and dynamic code execution with eval(), hardcoded large data, strings, and numeric variables that likely serve as payloads or control flow. Presence of many long variable names with seemingly random strings and numbers, which indicates code hiding or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code features two obfuscation functions that manipulate strings by shifting character codes based on parameters and then evaluate these strings as Python code. This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads or malicious logic. The code also imports sys and checks Python version info, possibly to adapt behavior or load specific payloads. The setup call indicates the package is intended for distribution, but the core logic involves dynamically reconstructing and executing code, which could be malicious. The presence of large base64-encoded or encrypted-looking strings and complex obfuscation functions strongly suggests an intent to hide malicious behavior or payloads. No direct malicious actions like network connections or file manipulations are evident outside of code evaluation, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs sophisticated obfuscation techniques with dynamic code evaluation, which strongly indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The heavy use of string manipulation and eval() suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. Despite the lack of explicit malicious actions in the visible code, the structure and obfuscation pattern raise high concern. The package should be considered unsafe until thoroughly deobfuscated and verified.",
