{
  "purpose": "The code employs heavy obfuscation, string encoding, and dynamic eval() execution to conceal malicious payloads and behavior.",
  "sources": "Encoded strings, large data blobs, and functions that decode and evaluate strings; environment checks via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "eval() calls on decoded strings, dynamic code execution, environment-dependent code paths.",
  "flows": "Source data (encoded strings) decoded by custom functions, then passed to eval() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with custom string manipulation functions, large encoded data, environment checks, and eval() usage on decoded payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily obfuscates its behavior through custom string decoding functions that manipulate large data blobs, then executes the decoded strings via eval(). The functions use character shifts and environment checks to alter behavior, indicating an attempt to hide malicious payloads. The consistent pattern of decoding and eval() on encoded data, combined with environment detection, is characteristic of malicious obfuscated scripts designed to evade static analysis. The high scores for malware (1), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified by these indicators, with strong confidence that the code is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, employing sophisticated obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques indicative of malicious intent. It should be treated as malicious until thoroughly deobfuscated and verified.",
