  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered under specific filesystem conditions, indicating malicious intent. The external code fetch and stealthy execution justify high malware and security risk scores. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely exploited as a vector for malicious payload delivery. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current indicators strongly suggest malicious activity."
