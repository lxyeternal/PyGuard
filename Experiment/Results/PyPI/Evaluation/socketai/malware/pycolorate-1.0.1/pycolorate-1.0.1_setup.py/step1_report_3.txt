{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code likely intended for malicious activity, possibly involving code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading of encoded strings, base64-decoded data, and compressed code; evaluation of dynamically generated code via eval.",
  "sinks": "eval executes dynamically constructed code, potentially malicious payloads; base64 and zlib decoding could be used to hide malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "Encoded string is decoded and decompressed, then executed via eval, which can lead to arbitrary code execution; code appears to generate code from obfuscated sources and execute it.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated, uses dynamic evaluation, base64 and zlib decoding, and complex lambda functions; presence of hardcoded base64 strings and multiple layers of decoding are suspicious; code comments and variable names are misleading or intentionally confusing.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with obfuscated imports and code that uses string manipulations, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and eval, which are common techniques to hide malicious payloads. The lambda functions generate code dynamically by decoding and decompressing data, then executing it via eval. The obfuscated string variables and the complex, multi-layered encoding suggest an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The code includes base64-encoded compressed data, which likely contains malicious payloads or commands. Overall, the code's structure, use of dynamic code execution, and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for executing hidden payloads or exfiltrating data.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly obfuscated, employs multiple layers of encoding and dynamic code execution, and shows typical signs of malicious payload delivery. It is designed to conceal its true purpose, likely to execute arbitrary malicious code or exfiltrate data without detection.",
