  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to some form of data processing or functionality involving imported libraries. The specific intent cannot be fully determined due to incomplete or missing context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input sources such as environment variables or potentially from files or network requests if present, but no explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being written to files, sent over the network, or printed to the console. No explicit sink actions are identifiable without more code context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (like environment variables or inputs) to sinks through various operations. Due to incomplete code, exact flow paths are not determinable.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are detected in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is minimal and lacks context, making comprehensive analysis difficult. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident from the available code. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are visible. The code does not demonstrate unsafe practices such as insecure data handling or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though limited information prevents definitive conclusions. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
