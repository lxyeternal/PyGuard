  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard application functions, possibly involving data processing or network communication, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files. Specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, system commands, or data storage points that could leak data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and may reach sinks such as network calls or system modifications. Exact flow paths cannot be determined without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present in the visible portion. Lack of comments or unclear variable names may obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code was analyzed step-by-step, considering input sources, data processing, and potential output sinks. No malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, code injection, or system backdoors were detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL calls reduces concern. However, incomplete code limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate purposes, but the incomplete context prevents a definitive verdict. No signs of malware or security issues were observed.",
