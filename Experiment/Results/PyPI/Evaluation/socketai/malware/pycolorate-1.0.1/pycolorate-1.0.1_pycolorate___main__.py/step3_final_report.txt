  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network sources, file operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via code execution paths, especially where untrusted data may influence network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "High suspicion of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unusual import patterns, or hardcoded secrets; no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code in report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks definitive malicious payloads, leading to moderate suspicion. Reports 3 and 4 are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, and report 1 and 5 lack code for analysis. The scores in all reports are consistent with their respective analyses, with report 2's malware score at 0.4 reflecting suspicion but no confirmation. Obfuscation scores align with suspicion levels, and risk scores are proportional to the assessed threat levels.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious activity across the reports. Report 2's obfuscation and suspicion justify moderate scores, but the absence of concrete payloads keeps malware suspicion moderate. The other reports are benign. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with minor potential adjustments to report 2's malware score to slightly lower suspicion if desired.",
