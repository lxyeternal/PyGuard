  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The only anomalies noted are empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields, which are unusual but not malicious.\n- The dependencies listed are common libraries that could be misused if compromised, but their inclusion alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Claim:** No signs of malicious code; dependencies are common; setup is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Claim:** Standard setup; dependencies could be privacy-invasive but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Slightly higher securityRisk due to potential misuse of dependencies, but no evidence of actual malicious behavior.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Claim:** Similar to above; no suspicious code; dependencies could be misused but are not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Claim:** No malicious code; dependencies are typical; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. Slightly elevated securityRisk due to dependencies, but no malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior; dependencies are common; only anomaly is empty author info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) reflect minor concerns about dependencies or missing author info, which are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** Given the dependencies involved, a **0.2** seems reasonable, reflecting potential misuse but no evidence of actual risk.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious logic.\n- The dependencies, while potentially privacy-invasive if misused, are common and not inherently malicious.\n- The missing author info is a minor anomaly, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | **0**          |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**          |\n| Security Risk  | **0.2**        |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the package setup code is benign and typical, with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation.",
