  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A minimal setup.py script using setuptools.\n- Defines package name, version, and dependencies.\n- No dynamic code, no input handling, no network calls.\n- 'author' and 'author_email' are empty.\n- Dependencies are common libraries: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests'.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, standard setup, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Evaluation:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the report correctly notes no malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup, unusual empty author fields, dependencies could be used maliciously but are not inherently so.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Evaluation:** Correct. The absence of malicious code is consistent, though dependencies could be misused elsewhere. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, no suspicious code, dependencies could be used maliciously but are not malicious in this context.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Evaluation:** Accurate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup, dependencies could be malicious if compromised, but no malicious code in setup.py.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Evaluation:** Correct. The code itself is benign, but the potential risk depends on external packages.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup, no anomalies, dependencies are common, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Evaluation:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minor concerns about dependencies or missing author info, which are reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate at 0, given the code's simplicity.\n- The **security risk scores** could be marginally increased if we consider the dependencies' potential misuse, but given the setup script alone, the current scores are reasonable.\n- The **confidence levels** are justified, given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, all reports are accurate and consistent with the code.** There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws in this setup script.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to dependencies that could be misused, but no direct evidence in the code)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature.",
