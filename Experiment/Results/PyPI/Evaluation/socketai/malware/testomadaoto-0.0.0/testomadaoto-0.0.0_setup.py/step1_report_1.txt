{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'testomadaoto' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The package dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential for dependencies to contain malicious code, but no direct malicious actions are present in this script.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration and package dependencies are specified, which may trigger installation of external packages, but no direct data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It imports necessary functions, defines a version string, and calls setup() with package details and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or credential handling. The dependencies listed are common packages, although their inclusion alone does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident in this minimal setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
