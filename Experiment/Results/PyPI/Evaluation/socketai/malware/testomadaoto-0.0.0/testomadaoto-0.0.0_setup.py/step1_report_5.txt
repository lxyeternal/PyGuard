  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'testomadaoto' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package setup parameters and dependencies from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies; potential for malicious dependencies if dependencies are malicious.",
  "flows": "From the setup() parameters to package installation and dependency fetching.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No malicious or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses it to define package metadata, including name, author info, and dependencies. Dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. These are common third-party libraries; however, their malicious potential depends on the remote packages, not the setup script itself. There are no suspicious code behaviors, hidden code, or obfuscated elements. The script's structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup, with no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The primary security concern lies in the dependencies themselves, which are commonly used libraries but should be verified separately for trustworthiness. Overall, the script itself appears benign.",
