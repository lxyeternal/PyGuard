{
  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are any processing or transmission of 'message', 'user', or 'recipient' data, but the function body is empty.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to the message-sending process, but the implementation is missing, so no actual flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation; no suspicious code or behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code defines a 'send' function with parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message', but contains no logic. The absence of implementation means there is no code that could perform malicious actions. Since no external libraries, network calls, or data processing are present, and no suspicious patterns are visible, the code appears benign. However, the purpose and context are limited, and without implementation, security assessment is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder function with no operational content, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a template or incomplete implementation. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
