{
  "purpose": "A placeholder function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'message' parameter, which could be used unsafely if it were processed or transmitted, but the function currently does nothing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into the function but are not used or processed further.",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation; no suspicious code, secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' with three parameters, indicating an intent to send messages. However, the function body is empty ('pass'), meaning no actual processing or data flow occurs. There are no data reads, external calls, or manipulations within this snippet. As such, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder with no functionality, malicious intent, or security risks. It does not perform any operations or data transmissions and is unlikely to be malicious in its current state.",
