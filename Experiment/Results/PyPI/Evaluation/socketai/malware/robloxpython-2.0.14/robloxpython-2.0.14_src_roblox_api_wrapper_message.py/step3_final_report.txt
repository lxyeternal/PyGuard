  "purpose": "This code defines a placeholder function intended to send a message from a User object to a recipient, but it contains no implementation.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are inputs; no data processing or external data reads occur.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present, as the function does not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur; the function is a stub with no logic or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple function definition with no implementation, which is normal for a placeholder; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no operational logic, data processing, or external interactions. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or active behavior. The function signature suggests intended functionality, but as written, it is inert. The absence of code execution, external calls, or data handling indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious behavior or security issues. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate. The code's inert nature means it poses no threat, and the scores reflect a safe state.",
