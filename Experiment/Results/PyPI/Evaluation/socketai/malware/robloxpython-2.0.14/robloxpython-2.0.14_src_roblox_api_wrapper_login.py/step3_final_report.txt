{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login, currently inert and do not perform any operations.",
  "sources": "Function definitions 'cookielogin(cookie)' and 'userpasslogin(username, password)' with no internal logic or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data processing; functions do nothing.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are inert placeholders with no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two stub functions with 'pass' statements, indicating no active logic or data handling. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions could be expanded in the future, but as is, they pose no security threat. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk is minimal (around 0.1) to reflect potential future concerns if the functions are maliciously implemented later. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and inactivity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, inert placeholder functions with no current malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's state. No further action is necessary unless future implementations introduce risks.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
