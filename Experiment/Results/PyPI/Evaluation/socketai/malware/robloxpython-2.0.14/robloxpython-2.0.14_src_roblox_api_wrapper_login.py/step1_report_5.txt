  "purpose": "The code provides placeholder functions for logging into the Roblox API using cookies or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie' in cookielogin; 'username' and 'password' in userpasslogin.",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks are present since the functions are empty; potential future sinks could include network requests or credential storage if implemented.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the functions are currently non-functional; potential flows would involve input parameters leading to network or storage operations.",
  "anomalies": "Both functions are empty and do not perform any actions; lack of implementation is not suspicious but indicates incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder functions intended for authentication, with no implementation or logic. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or network connections. The functions are inert, serving as stubs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is incomplete and does not perform any operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present in the provided snippet.",
