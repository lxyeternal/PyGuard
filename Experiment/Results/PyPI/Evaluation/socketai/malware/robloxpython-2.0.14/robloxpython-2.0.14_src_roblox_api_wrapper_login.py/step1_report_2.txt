{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for authenticating a user with the Roblox API, either via cookie or username/password.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' in functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions are empty and do not perform any operations that could leak data or affect the system.",
  "flows": "No execution flow or data flow exists since functions contain only 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no logic; no actual data handling, no network operations, no secret handling. Comment indicates future implementation but currently no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two placeholder functions intended for login purposes but currently do nothing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The structure is straightforward and minimal. Since the functions are empty, no source-to-sink data flows or anomalies are present. The code does not perform any actions, making it safe at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional stub with no malicious intent or security issues. It is incomplete but not suspicious in its current form.",
