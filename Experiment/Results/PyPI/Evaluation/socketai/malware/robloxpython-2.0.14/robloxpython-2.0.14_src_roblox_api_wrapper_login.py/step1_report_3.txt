{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login to Roblox API, with no implemented logic.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' as potential data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present; functions currently do nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs, as functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; potential placeholder for future malicious code, but currently inert.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for login purposes but does not implement any logic or data handling. There are no active code flows, no data processing, and no evident suspicious activity. The functions are empty, serving as placeholders, which by themselves do not pose security risks. However, their presence suggests the code may be part of a larger, incomplete or obfuscated module. Without further implementation, no malicious behavior is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is non-functional placeholder code with no malicious or security risk behavior evident. It does not perform any data processing or network communication in its current form.",
