{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for authenticating a user with the Roblox API, possibly to enable automated login or account management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' in the functions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'.",
  "sinks": "No actual implementation, so no sinks are currently present; potential sinks would be network requests or credential storage if implemented.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions but do not lead to any processing or data flow as the functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder functions for login mechanisms but does not perform any operations. There is no execution, data handling, or malicious activity visible. The lack of implementation prevents any malicious or security risk assessment beyond the recognition of incomplete code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a skeleton outline for login functions with no active logic. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks as is, but it indicates future functionality that could be expanded. Currently, the code is benign and does not perform any harmful actions.",
