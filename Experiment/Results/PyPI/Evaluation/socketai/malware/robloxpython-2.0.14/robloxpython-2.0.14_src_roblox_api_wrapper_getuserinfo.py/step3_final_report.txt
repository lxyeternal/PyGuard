  "purpose": "Retrieve information about the logged-in user",
  "sources": "None, function is unimplemented; import of requests is unused",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or transmission occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows; function is a stub with no logic",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of requests; function body is pass (empty)",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests but does not utilize it; the function getuserinfo is a placeholder with no implementation. There are no data flows, sinks, or external interactions. The code appears incomplete and does not perform any malicious or suspicious activity. The import of requests could suggest future network activity but currently is benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an incomplete stub with no active logic or malicious intent. The unused requests import does not indicate malicious behavior but suggests potential future extension. Overall, the code poses no security risk in its current state.",
