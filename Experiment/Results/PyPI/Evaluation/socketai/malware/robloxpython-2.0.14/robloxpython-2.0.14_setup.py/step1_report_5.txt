{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'robloxpython' and then execute obfuscated code which likely performs additional operations.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed with exec()",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes arbitrary code decoded from base64, including network requests or other malicious actions",
  "flows": "Decoded base64 data is executed via exec(), then it makes HTTP requests and writes files",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() to run obfuscated code, which is suspicious. The decoded code performs network requests to 'pastebin.com' and 'url' handling, indicating potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",
  "analysis": "The initial setup code defines package parameters for 'robloxpython' and imports 'setuptools' and 'base64'. Then, a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed dynamically with exec(). The decoded code imports 'urllib' and makes an HTTP request to a Pastebin URL, reads its content, and writes it to a file named 'cmd /c pkk_install.exe' in the current directory. It also includes a check for the existence of a file named 'pkk_install.exe', and if it exists, it attempts to run it. The use of dynamic code execution via base64 decoding and exec() combined with network communication to an external server suggests malicious intent, potentially to download and execute further malicious payloads or establish backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation techniques and dynamic execution to hide malicious behavior. It contacts an external server to fetch code or payloads and potentially executes malicious files, indicating high malicious intent. The setup code itself is benign, but the decoded part is suspicious and likely malicious.",
