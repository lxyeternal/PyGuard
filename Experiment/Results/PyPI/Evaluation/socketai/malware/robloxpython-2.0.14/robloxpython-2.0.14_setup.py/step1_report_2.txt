{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package called 'robloxpython' and then executes embedded base64-decoded code, likely for further processing or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the base64-encoded string passed to base64.b64decode().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decoded code, which can run arbitrary code in the environment.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded and immediately executed via exec(), creating a direct source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with a decoded string is suspicious; the base64-encoded payload indicates obfuscation or concealment of intent. The code loads external URLs, possibly for data exfiltration or remote control, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The initial part sets up a Python package with standard setuptools. The critical concern is the second part, where a base64 string is decoded and executed dynamically. The decoded code makes HTTP requests to 'https://pastebin.com/raw/...' and 'http://pastebin.com/raw/...', which are suspicious, as these URLs are often used to fetch malicious payloads or command-and-control instructions. The decoded code appears to import 'requests' and makes a GET request to retrieve content, then writes the content to files named 'pki_installer.exe' and 'system'. It seems designed to download and possibly execute external payloads, which poses a significant security risk. The use of exec() with decoded data is a common technique to hide malicious activities, and the presence of external URL requests increases suspicion. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent, potentially installing malware or remote control tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup with obfuscated malicious payload execution. The use of base64 decoding and exec() suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities, such as downloading and executing external malware. The overall security risk is high due to this behavior.",
