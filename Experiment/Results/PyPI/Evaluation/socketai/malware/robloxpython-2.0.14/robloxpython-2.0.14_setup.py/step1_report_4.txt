{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and executes dynamically decoded base64 code, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string decoded and executed via exec()",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via exec() which can run arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded -> exec() -> executes potentially malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() to run hidden code; presence of imported modules that are not directly used in the setup script; potentially obfuscated malicious payload",
  "analysis": "The script first performs standard setup for a Python package named 'robloxpython'. It then imports base64 and uses exec() to run a payload decoded from a base64 string. The decoded code imports URL handling modules, makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain (passtebin.com), and then performs an HTTP request to a remote URL, with the URL stored in a variable. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, such as exfiltrating data or downloading further payloads. The use of base64 decoding combined with exec() suggests obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload hidden behind base64 encoding and exec(). It performs suspicious network activity, indicating it is likely malicious. The package setup itself is benign, but the embedded payload is a security risk.",
