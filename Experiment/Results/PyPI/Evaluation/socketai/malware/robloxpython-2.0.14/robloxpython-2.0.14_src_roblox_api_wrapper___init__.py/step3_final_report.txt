  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, dynamic code constructs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, dynamic code execution, network requests, or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic features, complex constructs, potential obfuscation, minimal or incomplete code snippets, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are generally benign, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful network connections. Obfuscation is minimal, justified mainly in report 3 due to complex constructs. Security risks are low, with scores around 0.1-0.2, reflecting conservative assessment. Confidence levels are high where code is present, low where code is absent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores across reports are consistent with their reasoning, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The open-source dependency exhibits no malicious intent or significant security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. Minor obfuscation in report 3 is justified, and overall risk remains low. Continuous monitoring is recommended, especially for dynamic features, but current analysis indicates a safe dependency.",
