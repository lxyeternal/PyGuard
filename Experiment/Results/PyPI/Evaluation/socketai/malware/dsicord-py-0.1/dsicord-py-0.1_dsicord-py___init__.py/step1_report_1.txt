  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions, file reads, environment variables, or network requests. Specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs such as print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or system commands. No explicit sink functions are identifiable from the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks is not clearly visible; the code does not demonstrate obvious source-to-sink pathways. Without explicit data flow or function calls, no suspicious flow can be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python functions and library usage. No signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The absence of suspicious patterns or anomalous constructs suggests no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or dangerous practices observed.",
