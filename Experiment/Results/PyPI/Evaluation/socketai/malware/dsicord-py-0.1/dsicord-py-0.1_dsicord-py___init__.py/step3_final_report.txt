  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network operations, file I/O, utility functions, or data processing points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input acquisition → data processing or transmission → potential data exfiltration or system impact.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unnecessary dynamic code execution, or unusual code patterns. No such anomalies are reported.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate absence of code snippets or suspicious patterns, with high confidence scores often unjustified given the lack of code. Malware and obfuscation scores are consistently zero, aligning with benign assessments. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Some reports overstate confidence when no code is present; adjusting confidence to moderate levels (~0.6-0.7) would better match the evidence. Overall, the reasoning is sound, and scores are appropriate, with minor conservatism in risk levels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is deemed benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The scoring is generally consistent with the descriptions, though confidence levels could be moderated for reports lacking code. No significant security threats are identified, and the assessments are justified based on available information.",
