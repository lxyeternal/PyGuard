  "conclusion": "The script is almost certainly malicious, designed to sabotage or compromise the system. Its heavy obfuscation and system-level actions—such as package installation, shortcut creation, privilege escalation—are typical of malware. The current high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified. It should be classified as high risk and avoided in supply chain deployments."
