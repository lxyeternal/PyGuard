{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and manages imports for HTTP, JSON, and string handling to ensure backwards compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads from system modules such as sys, import statements for chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, and urllib.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily imports modules and assigns variables based on availability.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments based on module presence and Python version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are observed. The code is straightforward compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code handles module imports with fallback mechanisms and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3. It conditionally imports json handling modules, imports various standard library modules, and assigns types for compatibility. No untrusted input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected. The structure is typical for compatibility layers, and there are no hidden or obfuscated functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, nor does it perform any sensitive operations or data manipulations. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
