  "purpose": "Manage compatibility issues across Python versions, handle optional dependencies, and set up utility imports for URL, JSON, and string handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, sys.version_info, collections, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs import management and variable setup without processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely setup and import management",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer that manages imports and environment detection for Python 2 and 3. It handles optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, setting flags accordingly. All modules and functions are standard, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network activity. The structure is clear, and the logic is typical for such modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are justified and appropriate.",
