{
  "purpose": "The module handles compatibility issues across different Python versions and resolves imports for various utility functions and modules, primarily for HTTP and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet (conditionally), sys for Python version info, json or simplejson, collections, http.cookies, io.StringIO, and urllib.parse/request for URL and proxy handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily performs imports and assigns variables based on environment and Python version.",
  "flows": "The code initializes variables based on imports and Python version checks but does not process or manipulate untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are detected. The code consists of standard compatibility and import management routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical compatibility management tasks, including conditional imports and version detection. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. All imported modules and functions are standard and necessary for HTTP, JSON, and URL handling in a compatibility context. The code does not handle untrusted data nor contains network or data leakage mechanisms. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3 with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages imports and compatibility flags without any dangerous operations.",
