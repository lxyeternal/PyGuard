{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and import resolution for handling different Python versions and optional dependencies, mainly for use in a larger library or application dealing with HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, optional third-party libraries (chardet, simplejson), and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points where untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause data leaks or execution. The code mainly performs imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing dependencies and setting compatibility flags, with no user input or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward, primarily handling compatibility imports.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for Python version and optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson. It sets compatibility flags and imports various modules for HTTP and URL handling. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or external communications. The structure and logic are standard for a compatibility module. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility layer for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manages imports and compatibility flags without processing untrusted input or performing harmful actions.",
