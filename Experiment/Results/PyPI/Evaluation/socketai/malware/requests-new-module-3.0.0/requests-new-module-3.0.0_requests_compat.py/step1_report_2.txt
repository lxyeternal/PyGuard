{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and package dependencies, specifically for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly. The code only performs imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard compatibility handling and imports are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, dynamic importing of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and conditional importing of 'simplejson' or 'json'. It also defines common data types and imports modules related to URL parsing, HTTP proxies, and cookies. No malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured compatibility module without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and utility module for HTTP and JSON handling across different Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on its content.",
