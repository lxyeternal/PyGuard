  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The module manages compatibility issues across Python versions, handling imports for JSON, charset detection, URL parsing, cookies, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; mainly import and variable setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code. All modules are standard, and the logic is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** It's a typical compatibility layer with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing compatibility and optional dependencies, with no data processing or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on compatibility, conditional imports, and environment handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Compatibility handling, module imports, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, standard compatibility code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code snippets indicate any malicious intent. The code is solely for compatibility and import management.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Consistency:** The scores across reports are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility layer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is benign and serves a necessary compatibility function without any security concerns.",
