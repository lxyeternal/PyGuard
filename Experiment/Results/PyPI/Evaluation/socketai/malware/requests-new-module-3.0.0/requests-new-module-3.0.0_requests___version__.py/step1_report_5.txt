  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely metadata declarations with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments containing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, and license. No external input is read, no network connections, or dynamic execution occurs. The code appears to be a standard header or metadata module, typical for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing package metadata without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
