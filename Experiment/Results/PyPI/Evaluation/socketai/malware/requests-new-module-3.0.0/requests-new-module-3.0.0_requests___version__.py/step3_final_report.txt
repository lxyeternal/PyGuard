  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and descriptive information.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata. No input/output, network calls, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no malicious intent. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which aligns with the static, harmless nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1). There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are consistent with this assessment. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
