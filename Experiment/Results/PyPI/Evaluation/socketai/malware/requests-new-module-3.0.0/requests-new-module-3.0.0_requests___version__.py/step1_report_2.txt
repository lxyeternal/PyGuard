  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; this code only assigns metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments, which are harmless but uncommon. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of metadata variables describing the package, including author info, version, and license. The ASCII art comment is cosmetic and does not affect execution. No input reading, data sinks, or suspicious code behavior identified. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code is standard for package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalous behavior.",
