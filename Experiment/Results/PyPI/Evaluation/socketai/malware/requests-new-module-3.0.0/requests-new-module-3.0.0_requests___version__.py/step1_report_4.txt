  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments that initialize package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no external data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely assigns static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard metadata definitions with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string and numeric values to variables describing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, etc. No input handling, no external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations observed. The metadata appears legitimate and typical for a Python package setup or module information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' library. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign part of the package's source, serving documentation or metadata purposes.",
