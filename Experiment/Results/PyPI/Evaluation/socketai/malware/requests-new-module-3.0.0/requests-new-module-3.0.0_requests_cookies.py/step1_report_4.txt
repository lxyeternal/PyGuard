  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from request headers, request objects, and response objects. It also reads from cookies, cookies dictionary, and cookie parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure data could be added to headers or cookies. Cookie headers are constructed and cookies are manipulated, but no data is sent over the network directly by this code.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from responses into jars; cookie headers are generated from jars; cookies can be created and added to jars; cookies can be removed or retrieved by name. These flows are typical for cookie handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs. The code uses standard cookie handling routines, no obfuscated code or unusual language features. No code injection or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling utilities, including extracting cookies from responses, constructing cookie headers, managing cookie jars, and creating cookies. It leverages standard libraries and patterns, with no suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Functions operate on input data, cookies, and headers as expected. Overall, the implementation appears standard and secure, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie management for the requests library, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is primarily utility code that handles cookies responsibly and transparently.",
