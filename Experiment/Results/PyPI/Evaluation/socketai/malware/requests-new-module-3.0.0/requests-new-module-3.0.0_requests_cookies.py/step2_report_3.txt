  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie management utilities, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. It handles cookies safely, with standard patterns, and no signs of malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the utility nature, but since the code handles cookies that could influence request headers, a slightly higher score could be justified if considering potential misuse in certain contexts.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no malicious activity, and proper use of libraries.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is utility-focused, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie management, no external or suspicious data flows, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence and zero malware/risk scores are justified. The code is purely utility, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation, typical patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. The code's operations are standard, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and utility functions, standard patterns, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code content. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is utility-focused, handling cookies in a standard manner.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, consistent with the detailed analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, as the code is utility-based, but with a slight possibility that cookie manipulation could be misused in some attack scenarios (e.g., session hijacking), hence a minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and content. No adjustments needed.",
