{
  "purpose": "The code provides cookie management utilities, including wrappers for request/response objects, cookie extraction, creation, and a dict-like CookieJar class, facilitating cookie handling in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Request URL and headers, response headers, cookie attributes during creation and extraction.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers in requests, cookie storage in CookieJar, extraction of cookies from response headers.",
  "flows": "Request URL/headers -> Cookie extraction into jar; CookieJar -> Cookie header generation for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external network activity, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. It manages cookies safely, provides wrappers for request and response objects, and offers functions for cookie extraction, creation, and management. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) and zero malware score are justified given its utility nature. The high confidence scores reflect the clarity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured utility code for cookie management with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
