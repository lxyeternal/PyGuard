{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding data, managing cookies, and processing response content.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, hooks, and response raw streams.",
  "sinks": "Request body (encoded data), headers (including cookies), response content (bytes and decoded text), and hooks for request/response processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through encoding functions, URL parsing, header validation, request body construction, and response decoding. Data is read from streams or files, encoded as JSON or URL-encoded, and response content is decoded based on headers and detected encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no backdoors, and no unusual data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for HTTP request and response handling, with proper encoding, decoding, error handling, and security checks. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The data flows are typical for an HTTP client library, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response module, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
