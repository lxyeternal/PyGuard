  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), dictionary access methods (__getitem__, get), and update method in CaseInsensitiveDict.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary accessors (__getitem__, get), update operations, and __setitem__ methods.",
  "flows": "Input data during initialization or update flows into internal storage and can be retrieved via __getitem__ or get methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard data structures for managing headers or lookup tables with case-insensitivity and flexible key handling. The methods behave as expected for typical data structures without performing any network operations, file modifications, or executing untrusted code. No signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. All functions serve standard purposes within a library context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward implementations of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is consistent with typical library code for handling headers and configurations.",
