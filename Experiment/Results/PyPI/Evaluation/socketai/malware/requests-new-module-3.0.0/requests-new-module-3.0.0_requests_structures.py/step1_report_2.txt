  "purpose": "Define custom dictionary-like classes with case-insensitive keys and a simple lookup dictionary.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, method calls such as update, get, and item access.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval methods (__getitem__, get), dictionary iteration, and copying.",
  "flows": "Data stored in internal structures and retrieved via key-based methods; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code relies solely on standard library features and straightforward class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which normalizes keys to lowercase for case-insensitive access and maintains original key casing, and LookupDict, a simple dict extension with optional naming and customized __getitem__. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code uses standard library modules, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious operations. It is well-structured and contains no malicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code defines utility dictionary classes for case-insensitive key handling and simple lookups. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the requests library infrastructure.",
