{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__, __setitem__), and attribute access (__dict__) within the classes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code mainly manipulates internal data structures and does not perform external or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal storage (_store and __dict__), with no external data outputs or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard dictionary-like operations and data management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, which extend dict-like behavior for specific use cases. Both classes implement standard methods for data storage, retrieval, and representation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The classes rely solely on internal data structures and do not perform any external communications, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The implementation appears clean, straightforward, and consistent with expected data structure management. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements safe, standard data structures without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves its purpose within the Requests library without introducing security risks.",
