  "purpose": "This script provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, potentially exposing the certificate path if the output is captured.",
  "flows": "The source 'where' function returns the certificate bundle path; the output is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses a standard library function without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints the path to the default CA bundle. It includes a note that this can be modified for packaging purposes. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The purpose is solely to output a file path, with no suspicious behavior or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple purpose of displaying the CA certificate bundle path. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
