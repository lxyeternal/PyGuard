  "purpose": "This module returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package, used in the main block to output the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'print(where())' potentially exposes the location of CA bundle on the system, but does not involve untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' from certifi and prints its result; no untrusted data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code simply returns and prints a known, standard path from a trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known and trusted library (certifi) to output the path to the CA bundle. The main block executes only when run directly, with no user input or network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be to provide the CA bundle path for external use or configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended to output the CA bundle path from the certifi package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
