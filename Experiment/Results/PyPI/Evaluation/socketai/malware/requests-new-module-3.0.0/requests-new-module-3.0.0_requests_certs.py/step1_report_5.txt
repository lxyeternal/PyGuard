{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification, specifically referencing the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package via the import 'where' function and when executed directly, it calls 'where()' to print the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The printed CA bundle path could potentially be used by other scripts or processes, but this is standard behavior for SSL configuration and does not directly involve untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, and upon execution, calls 'where()' to output the path to the CA bundle, which could be used downstream for SSL verifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from certifi to obtain the CA bundle path and prints it if run as the main module. There are no data inputs, untrusted data flows, or suspicious code constructs. It is a simple utility script designed to output a configuration path. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for obtaining the default CA certificate bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose with no anomalies.",
