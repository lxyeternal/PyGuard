{
  "purpose": "The script provides the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, mainly for configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be considered a data sink but is a benign, informational output.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the result; no untrusted input or data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library (certifi) to retrieve the path to a trusted CA bundle. It simply prints this path when run as a script. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The purpose aligns with providing configuration info for SSL verification.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and straightforward, intended solely to output the CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
