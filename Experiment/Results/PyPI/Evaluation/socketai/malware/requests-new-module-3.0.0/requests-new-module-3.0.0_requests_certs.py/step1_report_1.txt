{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location from the certifi package for use in SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via the 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used by other processes or scripts.",
  "flows": "The source (import 'where') flows to the sink (print) to output the CA bundle location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. It serves as a utility to reveal the trusted CA certificates location. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, transparent, and uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to display the default CA certificate bundle location. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
