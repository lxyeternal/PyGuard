{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi', executed when the script runs directly.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: import of 'where'; Sink: print(where()); no complex data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and print statement, no obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a trusted library function and printing its result. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The purpose is purely informational, revealing the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification. The code's simplicity and reliance on a well-known library suggest it is benign. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or plausible in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
