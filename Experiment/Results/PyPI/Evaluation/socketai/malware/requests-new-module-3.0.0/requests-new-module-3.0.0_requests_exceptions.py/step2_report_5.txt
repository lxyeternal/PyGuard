  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to HTTP request handling.\n   - No dynamic code, external data processing, or network operations are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code follows standard Python practices for defining exception hierarchies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, sinks, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent in the exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a 0, which aligns with the absence of any security risks or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code is purely definitional—no runtime or external interaction—so there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified here; the code is standard exception hierarchy.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not import or execute any external code at runtime that could be malicious.\n   - Exception classes are typical and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard exception hierarchy for the requests library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
