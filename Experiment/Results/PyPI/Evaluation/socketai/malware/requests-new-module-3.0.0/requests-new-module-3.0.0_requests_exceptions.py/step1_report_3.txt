{
  "purpose": "Define and handle various exceptions and warnings related to HTTP requests within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and local compatibility modules; class constructors and attributes; exception handling code.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leakage, external system modification, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines exception classes and their inheritance structure without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Exception classes follow standard patterns; no obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for various request-related exceptions and warnings. It imports external exception classes and creates subclasses for specific error conditions. The constructors and attributes are standard, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure aligns with typical exception handling in Python libraries. There are no dynamic code executions, data exfiltration mechanisms, or suspicious control flows.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward implementation of exception and warning classes for handling HTTP request errors. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose without any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
