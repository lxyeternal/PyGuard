{
  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for the requests library to handle various HTTP and network-related errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat, class definitions, and exception initializers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines exception classes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard pattern for defining exceptions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions and other standard exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. It imports exception classes and defines subclasses representing different error conditions related to HTTP requests. No input processing, data handling, network operations, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard exception hierarchy implementation for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for handling request-related errors, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
