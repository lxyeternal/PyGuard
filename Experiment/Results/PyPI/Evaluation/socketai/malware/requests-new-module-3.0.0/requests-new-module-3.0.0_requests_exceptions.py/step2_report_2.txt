  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling in the requests library.\n- No dynamic code, external data processing, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior detected.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The classes are standard Python exception subclasses, with appropriate constructors.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or hidden code.\n- **Data flow:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only class definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n\n### Potential issues or anomalies:\n- No issues or anomalies detected.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign exception hierarchy.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are accurate and appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and correct. No changes needed.",
