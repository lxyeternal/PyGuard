  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim that dynamically rewires module references. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. While the module manipulation is unconventional and could be exploited maliciously, in this context, it serves a legitimate purpose. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
