      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload and obfuscation warrant a malware score of 0.85, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.85. It should be flagged, further analyzed, and possibly removed from distribution until verified safe."
