{
  "purpose": "The code collects all environment variables during installation or development setup and exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL, with SSL verification disabled.",
  "sources": "os.environ.items() during run of install and develop commands",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables are gathered and sent directly to the external URL during setup commands",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during package setup, insecure SSL handling (verify=False), hardcoded suspicious URL, no user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly intercepts environment variables during install and develop commands, then transmits them to a suspicious domain with SSL verification disabled, indicating covert data exfiltration. The URL is suspicious, and the lack of user notification suggests malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The behavior aligns with malicious activity such as data theft or backdoor setup. The insecure SSL and hardcoded URL further increase security risks. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, risk ~0.9) are justified given the covert exfiltration and security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package setup to a suspicious external server, with insecure SSL handling. It should be classified as highly malicious with a high security risk, warranting caution and removal from supply chains.",
