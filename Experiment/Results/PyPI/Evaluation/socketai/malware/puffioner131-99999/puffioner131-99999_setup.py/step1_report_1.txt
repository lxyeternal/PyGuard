  "purpose": "The code customizes the setup process of a Python package to send environment variables to an external URL during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.items()",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post() to a suspicious external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected and then sent via POST request to the specified URL during install and develop commands",
  "anomalies": "The code does not verify SSL certificates (verify=False), which can be exploited; sending potentially sensitive environment data to an external server without user consent; hardcoded external URL; no logging or user notification of data transmission",
  "analysis": "The script defines custom installation and development commands that, during execution, collect all environment variables. These are then transmitted to an external server via HTTP POST requests with SSL verification disabled, which is insecure. The external URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious, aimed at exfiltrating environment data. There is no indication of user notification, logging, or opt-in mechanisms. The purpose seems to be covert data exfiltration or surveillance within the supply chain, indicating malicious intent. The code operates during setup phases, making it likely to run automatically upon package installation or development setup, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating environment data to an external server during setup or development, with insecure handling of SSL and no user awareness. This indicates a high security risk and malicious intent.",
