      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, combined with error suppression and concealment tactics. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious behavior."
