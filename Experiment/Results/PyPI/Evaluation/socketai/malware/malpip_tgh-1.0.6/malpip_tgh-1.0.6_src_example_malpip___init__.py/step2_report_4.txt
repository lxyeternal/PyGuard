  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report, verify the consistency of scores, and assess the validity of their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Given the detailed reasoning and the absence of suspicious indicators, the low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) seem justified. The report's conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Due to lack of code, the report cannot perform detailed analysis. It assigns a low confidence (0.3) and malware score of 0, with a slightly low security risk (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is appropriate. Without code, it's impossible to assess malware or malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** The report suggests benign code, with standard imports, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. Confidence is moderate (0.6), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning appears sound. The code's lack of malicious patterns justifies the low malware score. The security risk score of 0.3 is slightly cautious but acceptable given the limited context.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, the report indicates benign code with no suspicious patterns, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the reasoning. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** The report concludes the code is standard data processing with no malicious behavior, moderate confidence (0.7), malware score 0, security risk 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:** Given the reasoning, the scores seem consistent. The moderate confidence reflects some uncertainty due to limited context.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with their reasoning and the absence of suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation or suspicious code structures.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.2 to 0.3) are reasonable given the limited context but do not indicate significant threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly cautious but overall low risk, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores and reasoning are consistent and justified. No adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment indicates that the code is benign with no apparent security threats.",
