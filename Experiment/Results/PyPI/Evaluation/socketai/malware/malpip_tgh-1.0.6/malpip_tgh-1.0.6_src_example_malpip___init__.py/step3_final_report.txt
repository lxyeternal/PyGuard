  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided analysis.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, import statements, environment variable usage, network calls, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs leading to sinks like data transmission or file writes, with no suspicious flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious or suspicious code present, with scores consistently at 0 for malware and obfuscation. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting limited code context but no indicators of malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), aligning with benign assessments. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified based on the available data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
