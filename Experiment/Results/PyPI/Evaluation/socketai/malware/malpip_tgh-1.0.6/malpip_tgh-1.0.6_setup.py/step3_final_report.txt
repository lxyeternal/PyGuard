{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute malicious actions during package installation or development setup, including establishing a reverse shell and exfiltrating user information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from os.getlogin(), network requests via requests.get(), and socket connections to a hardcoded IP and port.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data over the network via requests.get() and socket connection, and executes a shell via pty.spawn(), enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves username -> sends HTTP request with username -> establishes socket connection -> redirects stdin/stdout/stderr to socket -> spawns shell, all during package install/develop process.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port, direct execution of reverse shell commands during setup, explicit malicious behavior without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly defines a function 'mal()' that performs data exfiltration and reverse shell setup. It is invoked during the setup process via custom classes, making malicious actions automatic upon installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and uses standard modules for malicious purposes. The malicious intent is clear and active during package install, indicating high severity. The code does not contain any signs of obfuscation or indirect malicious triggers. All signals point to intentional sabotage, with network activity and shell access established without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing remote data exfiltration and providing a backdoor via reverse shell during package installation. The malicious actions are explicit, with no obfuscation, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are accurate and justified.",
