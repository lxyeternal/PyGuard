{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs malicious functionality to be executed upon installation or development setup, including establishing a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "User login via os.getlogin(), network address ccip and rport, import requests and socket modules, and the setup configuration that triggers mal() during installation or development.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to a remote URL (potential data exfiltration), socket connection to a hardcoded IP and port (remote command/control), os.dup2() and pty.spawn() to provide a reverse shell.",
  "flows": "The mal() function is invoked during 'install' or 'develop' commands, which gathers user info, contacts a remote URL, and establishes a reverse shell connection to ccip:rport.",
  "anomalies": "The setup script includes code that performs network communication and reverse shell setup during installation, which is highly unusual and malicious. Hardcoded IP and port, remote URL, and the execution of reverse shell code indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party modules, but the key malicious behavior is in the mal() function, which is triggered during package installation/development. This function exfiltrates user info via HTTP GET and opens a reverse shell to an external IP, effectively allowing remote control of the host. The code structure is typical for malicious Python packages intended to compromise systems upon install. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs beyond these malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious; it performs data exfiltration and provides a remote shell, indicating high malicious intent. The package's installation process triggers these harmful actions, making it dangerous to use.",
