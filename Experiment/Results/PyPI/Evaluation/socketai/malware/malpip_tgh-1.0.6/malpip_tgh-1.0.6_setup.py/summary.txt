  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing remote data exfiltration and providing a backdoor via reverse shell during package installation. The malicious actions are explicit, with no obfuscation, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are accurate and justified."
