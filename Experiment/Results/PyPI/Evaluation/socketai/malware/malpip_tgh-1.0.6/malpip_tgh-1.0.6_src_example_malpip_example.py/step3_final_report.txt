  "purpose": "A simple utility function that adds one to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data handling or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward addition function with no external dependencies, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The logic is simple, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety, with no need for adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
