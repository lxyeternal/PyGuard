  "purpose": "The function adds one to a given number, likely used for simple arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number', which is used in a mathematical operation.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result of the addition.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly into the addition operation, then the result flows to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function performing addition. It takes an input 'number' and returns 'number + 1'. There are no external data sources, no external sinks, and no complex control flow. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is simple, clean, and appears to serve a basic arithmetic purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a simple utility function for incrementing a number.",
