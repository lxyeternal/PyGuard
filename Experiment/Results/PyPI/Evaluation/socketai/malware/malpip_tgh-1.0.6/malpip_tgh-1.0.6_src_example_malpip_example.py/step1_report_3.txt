  "purpose": "The function adds one to the provided input number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received from function call, potentially from external code.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation and then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple arithmetic operation without hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that takes an input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data reads besides the input parameter, which is typical for functions. The operation is basic and safe, with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, benign operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
