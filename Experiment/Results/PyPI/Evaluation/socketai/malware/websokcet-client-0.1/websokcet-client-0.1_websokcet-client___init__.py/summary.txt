  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores. Reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution (notably reports 2 and 5) warrant moderate suspicion, with malware scores around 0.4 and obfuscation scores around 0.7. Benign reports are correctly scored with low or zero suspicion. Slight score refinements improve alignment with described behaviors."
