  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments reading untrusted input, environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), obfuscated code, network communication, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, system modifications, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, exec, dynamic imports, high obfuscation levels, unclear variable names, suspicious control flow, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and complex control flow, which are typical in malicious scripts. Some reports lack code, making analysis impossible, while others show moderate suspicion. Scores assigned reflect the suspicion level: high confidence and obfuscation in some, minimal or no suspicion in others. Minor score adjustments are recommended: lowering confidence in benign minimal code, slightly increasing malware suspicion where obfuscation and dynamic execution are present, and adjusting overall risk accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores. Reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution (notably reports 2 and 5) warrant moderate suspicion, with malware scores around 0.4 and obfuscation scores around 0.7. Benign reports are correctly scored with low or zero suspicion. Slight score refinements improve alignment with described behaviors.",
