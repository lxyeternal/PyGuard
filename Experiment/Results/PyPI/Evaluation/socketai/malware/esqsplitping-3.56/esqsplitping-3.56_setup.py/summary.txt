  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the high security threat posed by this behavior. The package should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further payload decoding."
