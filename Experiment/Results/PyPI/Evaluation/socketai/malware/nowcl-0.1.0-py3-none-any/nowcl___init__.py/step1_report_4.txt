{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive user data from the host system, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, billing information, badges, friends list, and IP address, then exfiltrate this information via Discord webhooks. It also attempts to disable security features, modify Discord-related files, and inject malicious code into Discord processes, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., appdata, localappdata), reads files from browser profiles (cookies.sqlite, Login Data), SQLite databases for cookies and passwords, and web content for tokens and other sensitive data. It also captures screenshots and reads user info via Discord API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent through webhooks to external Discord servers. Sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, user IP, and personal details are exfiltrated. It also modifies files (e.g., Discord modules) and disables security features.",
  "flows": "Sources include local files, browser storage, and web API responses; flows proceed to data parsing and decryption functions. Extracted tokens and credentials are collected into lists and sent via webhooks, with auxiliary flows to disable security and inject code into Discord processes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated, redundant functions, and malicious intents such as disabling Windows Defender, injecting scripts into Discord, modifying Discord's internal files, and killing processes associated with security and Discord. It also reads a suspicious external script ('grab.js') for code injection. Use of hardcoded webhook URLs, disabling firewall, and removing security features are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a credential stealer by extracting tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data from various browsers and Discord. It decrypts encrypted data using system keys, reads local files, and performs network requests to gather user info. It disables security measures, injects malicious scripts into Discord, and exfiltrates data to external webhooks, all indicating malicious behavior. The presence of code to disable Defender and firewall further emphasizes its harmful intent. Overall, the script is crafted for persistent and stealthy credential theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to harvest sensitive user data and system information, disable security features, and exfiltrate the data to remote servers. It exhibits typical traits of malware, including credential theft, process injection, security bypass, and data exfiltration, confirming high malicious intent.",
