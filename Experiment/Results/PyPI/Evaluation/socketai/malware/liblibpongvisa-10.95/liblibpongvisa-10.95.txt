      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload conditioned on filesystem state. The silent error handling and suspicious URL further support this. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and this package should be treated as malicious or compromised."
