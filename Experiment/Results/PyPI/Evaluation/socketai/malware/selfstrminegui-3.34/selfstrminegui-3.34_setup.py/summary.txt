  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating a significant security threat. The embedded URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious activity, possibly a backdoor or remote code execution vector. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as malicious or dangerous pending further analysis."
