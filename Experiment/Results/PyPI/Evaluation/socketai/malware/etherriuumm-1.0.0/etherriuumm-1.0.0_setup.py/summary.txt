  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to encrypted payload execution during installation on Windows, obfuscation, and use of 'exec()'. The assigned scores are justified, and the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, warranting caution and further analysis."
