  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior, potentially executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting and executing embedded code via Fernet.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network requests (imported but not explicitly used), potentially insecure code execution.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> decrypting Fernet-encrypted payload -> executing code with exec() during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed with exec() during installation; code obfuscation via random class and variable names; long, nonsensical description strings; inclusion of a potentially malicious decrypt-and-execute pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with a custom install command class named with obfuscated identifiers. During installation, if on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, executing this payload dynamically with exec(). The decrypted code's purpose is unknown, raising suspicion. The encrypted payload might contain malicious code, and executing it during installation constitutes a significant security risk. The use of obfuscated class names and long, meaningless strings further suggests intent to hide malicious behavior. Overall, the code's design is suspicious, primarily because of dynamic code execution from encrypted data during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The overall risk is high due to the potential for executing arbitrary, malicious payloads during package install time.",
