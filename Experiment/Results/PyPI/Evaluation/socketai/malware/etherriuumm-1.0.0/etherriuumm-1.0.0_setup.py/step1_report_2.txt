{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command which decrypts and executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import requests, import Fernet, encrypted Fernet key and encrypted code string",
  "sinks": "exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...))",
  "flows": "During install, if OS is Windows, import requests and Fernet, then decrypt and execute embedded code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with decrypted code, embedded encrypted payload, execution during installation process, lack of transparency or documentation for code being executed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom install class. The install class's run method conditionally imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload with Fernet. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, which is suspicious. The execution of decrypted code during installation is a significant security concern, as it can run arbitrary code without user consent. The code appears designed to hide malicious behavior within the decrypted payload, possibly to evade detection. No external sources are involved apart from standard setup procedures, but the embedded payload execution is a major anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a potentially malicious custom installation step that decrypts and executes embedded code, which could be used for malicious purposes such as backdoors, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and execution during install strongly indicates malicious intent.",
