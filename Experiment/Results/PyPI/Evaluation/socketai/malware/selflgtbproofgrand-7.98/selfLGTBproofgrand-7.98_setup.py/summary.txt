  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated remote code execution, embedded suspicious URL, and error suppression. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It warrants further investigation, including decoding the payload to verify malicious intent. The package should be treated with caution until confirmed safe."
