  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands under conditions designed to conceal malicious intent. The setup process is legitimate but overshadowed by the malicious payload. The assigned scores are appropriate; I recommend treating this package as highly risky and further decoding the payload for confirmation."
