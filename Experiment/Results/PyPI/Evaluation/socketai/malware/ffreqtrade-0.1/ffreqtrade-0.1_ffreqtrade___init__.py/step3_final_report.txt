  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, network connections, environment variables, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded credentials or network data flow into sinks like network connections or file writes, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of suspicious network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, obfuscation patterns, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious behaviors such as network connections to suspicious domains, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded credentials, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation levels are moderate, and benign code shows no such patterns. The scores reflect these observations: malware score at 0.6 due to suspicious behaviors, obfuscation at 0.3, and high risk at 0.7 for Report 1. Other reports show no malicious indicators, with scores at 0.0 or 0.2, aligning with benign assessments. The scoring is consistent with the detailed analysis and observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains moderate malicious indicators in Report 1, justified by network activity, dynamic execution, and obfuscation. Other reports are benign. Overall, the scores are consistent and justified, with a moderate malware and risk level due to the suspicious elements in Report 1.",
