{
  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library, including network, JSON, and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat for JSONDecodeError; class initializations and attribute access within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be passed to error messages or exception attributes, but no direct data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with error details; these could carry untrusted data in their messages or attributes, but no active data flow or external system interaction is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. All classes are standard exception subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for error handling within the Requests library. It imports standard exception classes and extends them for specific error types. The constructors perform attribute assignments and calls to parent constructors without executing external code or processing untrusted input directly. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure is straightforward, focusing on exception handling and warnings related to HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class definition module for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It contains no harmful code or backdoors and appears to serve its intended purpose in error handling. Overall, the code is safe.",
