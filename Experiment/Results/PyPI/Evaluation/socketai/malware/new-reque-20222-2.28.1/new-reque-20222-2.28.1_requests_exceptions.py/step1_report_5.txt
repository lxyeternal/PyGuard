{
  "purpose": "Define a set of custom exception classes for handling various errors related to HTTP requests in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external exceptions (`urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError` and `compat.JSONDecodeError`), and class constructors that initialize exception instances.",
  "sinks": "Exception initialization, raising, and handling within the class constructors; no external data or untrusted input processing identified.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation occurs in the class constructors, but no data flow from external sources to critical sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes used for error handling in an HTTP request context. It imports standard exceptions and creates subclasses to categorize different error types. The constructors set relevant attributes based on provided arguments. No external input processing, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured and adheres to typical exception handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard set of exception definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured error handling code without any malicious intent.",
