{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for the Requests library to handle different error scenarios during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "None of the code acts on untrusted data; it solely creates exception classes and imports dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code establishes class hierarchies without data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions and defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling HTTP and connection errors, including warnings. All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or other request-specific exceptions. There are no signs of data manipulation, code execution, or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure and content align with typical library exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and straightforward.",
