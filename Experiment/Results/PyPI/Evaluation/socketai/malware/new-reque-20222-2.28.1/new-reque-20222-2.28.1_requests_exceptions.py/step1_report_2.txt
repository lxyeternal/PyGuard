{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported exception classes and defines new exception classes; no external untrusted input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves raising and catching exceptions, not processing untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. All exception classes are standard and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for error handling within the requests library. It imports existing exception classes and creates subclasses for various HTTP and connection errors. No input/output processing, no external data parsing, and no suspicious behavior are present. The structure and content align with typical error handling code, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for the requests library, with no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It simply facilitates error handling in HTTP requests.",
