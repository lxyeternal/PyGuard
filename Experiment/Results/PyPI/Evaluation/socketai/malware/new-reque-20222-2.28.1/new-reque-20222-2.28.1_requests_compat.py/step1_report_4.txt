{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility shims for Python 2 and Python 3, handling imports and version-specific differences.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules: sys, chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks, system modifications, or external communications identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues. The code primarily manages imports and compatibility settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code uses conditional imports and version checks appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional modules and handles compatibility across Python versions. It uses standard practices for such compatibility layers. No dynamic execution, no external data handling, and no insecure patterns are present. The import of 'chardet' with a fallback to 'charset_normalizer' is standard for character encoding detection. The version checks and conditional imports are typical for cross-version compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, with safe import practices. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be benign and solely intended for maintaining compatibility.",
