{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility imports and utility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3 in the requests.compat module.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookiejar, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "Import statements, especially dynamic imports, and potential use of untrusted modules or data sources",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules and compatibility checks, but no untrusted data handling or external data manipulation is evident",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard compatibility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to handle compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 by importing necessary modules and defining version-specific variables. It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and 'simplejson' or 'json'. No user input, network, or untrusted data handling is involved. The code appears to be standard, straightforward, and without malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate compatibility and does not involve external data manipulation or insecure practices.",
