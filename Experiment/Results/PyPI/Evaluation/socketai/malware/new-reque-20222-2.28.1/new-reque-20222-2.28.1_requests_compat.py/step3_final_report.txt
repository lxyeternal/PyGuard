  "purpose": "Compatibility module for handling import issues and version differences between Python 2 and Python 3, ensuring backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson), version info checks, and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; the code only performs safe imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward import handling and version detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer that safely manages imports, version detection, and type definitions. It uses try-except blocks for optional dependencies, sets version flags, and defines type aliases. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The logic is simple and aligns with common practices for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves its purpose as a compatibility utility. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
