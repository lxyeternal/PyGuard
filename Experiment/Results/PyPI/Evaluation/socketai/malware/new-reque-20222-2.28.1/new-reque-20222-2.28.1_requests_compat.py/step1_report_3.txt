{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling string types, JSON decoding, and HTTP-related operations across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from sys.version_info, import statements for 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson', and standard library modules such as collections, http, io, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data directly; the code primarily imports modules and defines variables. No external data or untrusted input is being processed or output.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules based on availability and setting version-related variables, with no dynamic data processing or external data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and intended for compatibility purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports compatibility libraries and modules, manages version-specific variables, and conditionally imports json modules. It also defines type aliases and imports standard collections and urllib modules. All operations are standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard imports and setup for a larger package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
