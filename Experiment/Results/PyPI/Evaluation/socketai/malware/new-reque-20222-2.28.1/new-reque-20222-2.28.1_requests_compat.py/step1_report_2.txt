{
  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility issues and provides backward compatibility for different Python versions and third-party modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request) and conditional imports of 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson', 'json'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Imports from external modules (chardet, simplejson/json) could introduce dependencies, but they are optional and handled safely. No data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly resolves compatibility issues and imports modules conditionally based on availability.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, conditional importing of modules like 'chardet' and 'simplejson', and defines some type aliases. All operations are typical for such modules. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious data handling or malicious behavior are present. The import statements are all from standard or well-known libraries, and there are no dynamic code executions or network operations involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only imports standard libraries and handles optional dependencies safely. No malware or security concerns are evident.",
