{
  "purpose": "To provide compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, data encoding, and Python version differences in the requests.compat module.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookiejar, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.",
  "targets": "Uses imported modules and functions, but there are no explicit targets where untrusted data is processed or output is generated.",
  "flows": "The code imports and assigns modules and functions; no data flows from external sources to sinks are explicitly present within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, compatibility adjustments, and type definitions. It uses try-except blocks for optional dependencies and sets up aliases for Python 2 and 3 compatibility. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The logic is standard for a compatibility module, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, without anomalies or malware indications.",
