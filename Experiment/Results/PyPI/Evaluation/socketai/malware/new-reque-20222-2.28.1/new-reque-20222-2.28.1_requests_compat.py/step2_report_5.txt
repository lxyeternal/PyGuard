  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility and utility module for handling imports, Python version differences, and related setup.\n- No report mentions any suspicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or data processing involving untrusted sources.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and well-known third-party modules, with safe conditional imports.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate compatibility across Python versions, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears correct and standard for its purpose.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The import statements, version checks, and conditional dependencies are all typical and safe.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are identified.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound and aligned with common practices.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are evident.\n- The reports are accurate in stating that the code is straightforward and benign.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The **security risk** is minimal; the code is a compatibility shim.\n- The **import of optional modules** (chardet, simplejson) is handled safely.\n- The code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or system modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe compatibility module with no security concerns.",
