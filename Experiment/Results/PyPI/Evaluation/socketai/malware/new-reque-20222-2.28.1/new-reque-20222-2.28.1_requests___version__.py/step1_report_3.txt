  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard package metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variables defining package information. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The content appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata file.",
