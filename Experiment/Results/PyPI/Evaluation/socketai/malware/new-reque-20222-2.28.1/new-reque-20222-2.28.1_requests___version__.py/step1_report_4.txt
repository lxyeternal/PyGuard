  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for a Python package named 'requests', providing descriptive information about the package.",
  "sources": "Metadata attribute assignments (e.g., __title__, __description__, __url__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data paths; this is purely static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of static string assignments and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static variable definitions that specify package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. No user input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution is present. The comments are decorative ASCII art and do not influence code behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a harmless metadata declaration for the 'requests' library. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
