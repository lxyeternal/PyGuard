  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for the 'requests' Python library, including ASCII art comments.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric variables defining package info (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments without data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata assignments with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments, but these are purely decorative and do not affect code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, input/output, network calls, or dynamic code. ASCII art comments are benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup files. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
