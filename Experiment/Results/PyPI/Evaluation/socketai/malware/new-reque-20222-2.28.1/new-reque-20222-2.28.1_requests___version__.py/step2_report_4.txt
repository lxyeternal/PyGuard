  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is purely static metadata assignments—no dynamic behavior, no input/output, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code is benign, consisting of variable assignments for package metadata, with ASCII art comments that are purely decorative.  \n**Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious code present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is static metadata, with no suspicious features. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0  \n- `obfuscated`: 0  \n- `securityRisk`: 0  \n- `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)  \n\nThese scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely static metadata with no signs of malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at 0. The reports' scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware and security risk, perfect confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward package metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks. The high confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is entirely benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**.",
