  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or external systems; the code only assigns static string and numeric values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The code contains ASCII art comments and static variable assignments, which are typical for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard module-level metadata declaration for a Python package, with no runtime behavior, no user input, and no external data access. It includes ASCII art comments, which are benign decorative elements. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve solely as descriptive metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, containing no suspicious or malicious elements. It is typical for Python packages and does not pose security risks.",
