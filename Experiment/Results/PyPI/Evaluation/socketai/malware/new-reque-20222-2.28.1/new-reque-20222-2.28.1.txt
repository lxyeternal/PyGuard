The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. The overall risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain purposes."

The current security scores are justified. It is recommended to monitor such patterns, but no immediate threat is identified."
