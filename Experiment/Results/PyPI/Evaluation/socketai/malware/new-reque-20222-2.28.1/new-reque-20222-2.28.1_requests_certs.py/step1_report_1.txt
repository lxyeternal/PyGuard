{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, called in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code imports a trusted function 'where' from certifi, then outputs its result. No untrusted input flows into the system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for obtaining CA bundle location. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, which is a well-known library providing CA certificates. When executed directly, it prints the path to the CA bundle. This is a common utility pattern and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data is read from untrusted sources, no untrusted data is output or processed. The code does not attempt to hide or obfuscate any behavior, nor does it perform any network operations or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for returning the CA bundle path used in SSL verification, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
