{
  "purpose": "The code outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, serving as a utility to identify the trusted CA bundle location.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the import 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path using print(), which is a benign operation; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) provides the CA bundle path, which flows directly to the print() sink when the script is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the certifi package and prints its value when run. It performs no input validation, network activity, or data manipulation. The purpose is solely to display the trusted CA bundle path, which is a benign utility. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's operation is standard and safe, with no potential for malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the CA bundle used by certifi. It involves no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
