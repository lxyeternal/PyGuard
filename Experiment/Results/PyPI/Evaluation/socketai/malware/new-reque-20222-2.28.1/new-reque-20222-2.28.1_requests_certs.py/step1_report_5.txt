{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL/TLS verification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the certifi package via 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be observed or captured by an attacker if this output is intercepted.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where()' function from certifi -> sink: 'print()' outputting the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply retrieves and displays a trusted CA bundle path. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints the location of the CA bundle when executed directly. It is a straightforward utility script with no external data inputs or network communication. The code’s purpose is to expose the location of the CA bundle used for SSL verification, which is a common, benign operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying the certifi CA bundle path. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
