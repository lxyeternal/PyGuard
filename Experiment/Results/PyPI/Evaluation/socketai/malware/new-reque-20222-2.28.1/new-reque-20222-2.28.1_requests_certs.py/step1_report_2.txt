{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for HTTPS verification, primarily via the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path through the certifi.where() function.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points evident.",
  "flows": "The program calls certifi.where() as a source and prints the result; the flow is straightforward with no data transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the certifi library and outputs its default CA bundle location. There are no user inputs, no data processing beyond calling certifi.where(), and no network or file modifications. The code functions solely as a utility to display a configuration path. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal, clear, and follows best practices for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely informational, serving to display the certifi CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
