{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to output the default CA certificate bundle location used by the certifi package, mainly for use in packaging or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package via 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'print(where())' statement, which outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The data flow is from the 'where' function (source) to the 'print' statement (sink), with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from the certifi package to obtain the path to a trusted CA bundle. When run directly, it outputs this path. There are no inputs from external sources, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors present. The code appears to serve a simple utility purpose with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to output the location of a CA bundle for use in packaging or environment setup. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
