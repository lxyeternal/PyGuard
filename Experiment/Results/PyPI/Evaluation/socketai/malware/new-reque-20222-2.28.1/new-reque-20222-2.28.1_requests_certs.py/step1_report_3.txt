  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path",
  "flows": "The 'where()' source provides data that is output via 'print', with no further processing or untrusted input involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical usage of certifi",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from certifi to obtain the path to the CA bundle. It then prints this path when executed as a script. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, data collection, or system modification. The functionality is limited to reporting a static, well-defined resource path. The code is minimal and purpose-specific, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and simply outputs the path to the certifi CA bundle. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
