  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary and a lookup dictionary used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), and attribute access (__dict__) in classes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external systems, nor are external calls made.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within internal dictionary operations and method calls, with no external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both classes are standard data structures that do not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system calls. They provide internal management of data with specific behaviors (case-insensitive keys and named lookup). There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It solely provides utility data structures for internal use within a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of utility dictionary classes for internal use in the Requests library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
