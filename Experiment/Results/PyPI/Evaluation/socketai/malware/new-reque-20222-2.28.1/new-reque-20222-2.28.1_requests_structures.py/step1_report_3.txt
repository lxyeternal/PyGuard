  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), updates (update), and __repr__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Data access via __getitem__, get, or iteration methods, which could be exploited if data is maliciously injected.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in internal structures (_store and __dict__) and retrieved via key-based access methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; the code appears to be straightforward implementations of dictionary-like objects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which normalizes keys for case-insensitive access and stores keys with their original case, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary subclass with optional named identification. Both classes implement standard dictionary methods, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling. The classes rely on standard collections and do not include any obfuscated or unusual language features. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionary data structures used in the Requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs common patterns.",
