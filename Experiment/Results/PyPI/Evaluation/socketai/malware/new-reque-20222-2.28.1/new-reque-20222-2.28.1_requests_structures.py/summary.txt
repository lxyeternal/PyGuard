  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility classes with no malicious activity or security risks. The minor bug in the copy() method does not impact security. The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. The overall risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain purposes."
