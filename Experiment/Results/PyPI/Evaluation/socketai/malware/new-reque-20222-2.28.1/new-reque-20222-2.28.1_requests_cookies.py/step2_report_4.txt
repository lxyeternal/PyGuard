  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, anomalies, and conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Utility functions for cookie extraction, management, and conversion within requests. No suspicious data flow or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of internal modules, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie management code, legitimate, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** This appears to be legitimate utility code. The low security risk score aligns with its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Similar cookie management functions, with potential data flow into headers and storage.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe cookie handling code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate utility code, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Provides cookie utilities, with data flowing from HTTP responses and user input into cookie jars.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical cookie management code, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Standard, secure cookie handling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Similar functions, with data from request/response headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, management, with data flowing from request/response headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, transparent cookie management code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose as cookie management utilities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (0.2) in most reports, which is reasonable given the nature of cookie handling—potentially misused if untrusted data is involved, but the code itself is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight, inherent risk in cookie handling utilities, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The code is purely utility functions for cookie management, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is legitimate, standard cookie management utility code with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; I would not recommend any changes.",
