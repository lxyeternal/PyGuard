  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie handling, including extraction, creation, deletion, and management within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Request URLs, request headers, response headers, internal modules (_internal_utils, compat).",
  "sinks": "Headers for requests, cookie storage (CookieJar), cookie creation and deletion functions.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers provide data to cookie management functions; response headers are parsed into cookies; cookies are added/removed/merged in CookieJar.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured cookie management utilities used within the requests library. It wraps internal modules for compatibility, manages cookies via typical functions, and serializes cookie jars for persistence. No malicious logic, network activity, or backdoors are present. The data flows are straightforward, handling headers and cookie objects without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard utility code for cookie management with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
