  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities for cookie handling, no suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Functions manipulate headers and cookies, standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of internal modules (_internal_utils, .compat) is typical for internal compatibility layers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; purely utility functions for cookie management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie utilities, standard data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, setting, merging, and deletion; standard flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious logic; standard library use.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, no backdoors, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management, with compatibility wrappers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, creation, merging, serialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions are standard, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, and management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, header generation, modification.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling utilities, standard sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, manipulation.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical cookie management functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of cookie management utilities.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, as the analysis aligns with the code's straightforward utility functions.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1–0.2, as currently assigned.\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:** I agree with the provided scores.\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is legitimate, standard cookie management utility code with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
