  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie handling, importing internal modules and standard libraries.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Data flows are straightforward; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious indicators. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie management, with data flowing from HTTP responses and user input.\n- **Potential Concerns:** Slightly higher emphasis on potential leak points, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no backdoors or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The risk score is reasonable given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, with data flow from request/response headers.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions are standard; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent; the code is typical for cookie management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, with data flow from headers and user data.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No signs of malicious activity; standard cookie handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, with data flow from request/response objects.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No malicious activity; functions are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence and zero malware score are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is utility-focused, handling cookies, with no network activity or suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern due to cookie handling, which is inherently sensitive but standard here.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor security concern due to cookie management, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, standard cookie management utility code for the requests library, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
