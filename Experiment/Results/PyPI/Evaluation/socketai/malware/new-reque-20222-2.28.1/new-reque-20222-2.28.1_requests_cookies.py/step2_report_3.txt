  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie handling, importing internal modules and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Functions manipulate headers, extract cookies, and create/update cookies. Data flows from request URLs/headers and response headers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code wraps and manages cookies as expected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate cookie management code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. The logic is straightforward, and the data flows are typical for cookie handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cookie management utilities, focusing on extracting, setting, and removing cookies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are extracted from responses, headers are generated, and cookies can be added or removed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard design, no obfuscated or suspicious code. Uses common patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard utility code, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, management functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie data flows from headers into cookie jars, and vice versa.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard code, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; functions serve typical cookie management roles.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with focus on utility functions and cookie handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie data flows between headers, jars, and functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious logic; standard handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies flow from request/response headers into cookie jars, and headers are generated.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, transparent code, very high confidence (1.0), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Completely benign, standard cookie utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or similar code snippets—standard cookie management utilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and find no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Risks:** Security risks are minimal (0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of cookie handling utilities.\n- **Logic & Data Flows:** Consistent, straightforward, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — standard utility code with minimal security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities used within the requests library. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities has been identified.",
