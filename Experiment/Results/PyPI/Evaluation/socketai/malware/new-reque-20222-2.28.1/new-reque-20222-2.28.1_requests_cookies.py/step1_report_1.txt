{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and methods that read request URLs, headers, and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Functions that manipulate headers (add_unredirected_header, get_cookie_header), extract_cookies_to_jar, and cookie creation/update functions that handle cookie data.",
  "flows": "Input data from request URLs and headers flows through MockRequest and MockResponse wrappers into cookie extraction and header generation; cookie data flows between create_cookie, cookiejar_from_dict, merge_cookies, and internal cookie management methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, non-public modules (._internal_utils, .compat), and extensive cookie management logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for cookie handling in the requests library, including extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookie jars. It wraps and adapts cookie objects and request/response headers to interface with 'cookielib' structures. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system manipulation. The functions operate purely on cookie data and headers, with no code that performs harmful actions. The inclusion of internal modules and extensive cookie management logic appear legitimate and aligned with the library's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for cookie management within the requests library. It handles cookies securely without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No malware, suspicious network activity, or security risks are evident.",
