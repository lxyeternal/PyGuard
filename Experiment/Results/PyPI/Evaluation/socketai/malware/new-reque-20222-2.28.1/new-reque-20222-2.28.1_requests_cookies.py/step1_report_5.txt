  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including extracting, setting, removing, and managing cookies through a CookieJar interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_internal_utils, compat) and standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading). Data is read from request objects, response objects, and cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into jar, cookie header generation, cookie removal by name, setting cookies, and updating cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into MockRequest; response headers flow into MockResponse; cookies are extracted, created, or manipulated through functions like extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, create_cookie, and merge_cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard cookie management functions. No suspicious external domain connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Exception handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie handling functionalities, including mocking request/response objects to interface with cookie management, extracting cookies from responses, creating and managing cookies, and providing dict-like access to cookies. It carefully wraps standard library classes to add compatibility and serialization support. No malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or privacy violations are observed. The functions are straightforward and serve typical cookie management purposes, aligning with expected secure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for cookie handling in requests, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It provides utility functions for managing cookies in a transparent and expected manner. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
