  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs dependency checks, imports modules, and configures warnings/logging. No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are evident.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dependency validation could theoretically hide malicious modifications if dependencies are compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the code's nature. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on environment setup, dependency validation, and SSL fallback mechanisms.\n- **Findings:** Standard setup routines, no suspicious code or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. The absence of malicious behavior aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency management, environment checks, SSL support configuration.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard dependency validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency validation, environment setup, suppression of warnings.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency checks, SSL configuration, no direct handling of untrusted data.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as dependency setup, with minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard dependency validation and environment setup)\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, standard setup code for the Requests library, with no signs of supply chain attack, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. They are aligned with the code's purpose and observed behavior.",
