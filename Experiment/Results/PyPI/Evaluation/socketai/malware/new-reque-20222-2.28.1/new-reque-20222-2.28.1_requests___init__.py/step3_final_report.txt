  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and warning configuration for the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, environment conditionals, and dependency assertions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; internal dependency checks only.",
  "flows": "Dependency and environment validation routines executed during module import; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup routines with version assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version checks, SSL fallback configuration, and warning management, all typical for a well-maintained open-source library. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dependency validation routines could theoretically be exploited if dependencies are compromised, but no evidence suggests this. The code is straightforward, with no handling of user input or untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, benign setup code for the Requests library, with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score reflects routine dependency validation routines, which are justified but do not pose an actual threat.",
