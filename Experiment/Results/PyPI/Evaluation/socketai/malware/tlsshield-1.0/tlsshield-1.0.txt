All reports correctly identify this behavior, and the scores reflect the high severity. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided. The obfuscation is minimal, but the dynamic nature of code execution warrants high malware and security risk scores."

The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores. The pattern is typical of malware delivery mechanisms, and the code should be flagged as highly dangerous."
