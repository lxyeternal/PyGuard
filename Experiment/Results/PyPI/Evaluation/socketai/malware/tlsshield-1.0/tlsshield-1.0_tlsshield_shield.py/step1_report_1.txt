  "purpose": "Create a temporary Python script that fetches and executes remote code, then runs this script as a separate process.",
  "sources": "Reading the tempfile object (_ttmp) for the remote code; reading the system executable path (_eexecutable)",
  "sinks": "Executing a system command with _ssystem, running a new process with the modified executable path",
  "flows": "Write remote code to tempfile → close tempfile → execute system command to run the Python interpreter with the tempfile as argument",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes remote code dynamically, which is a significant security concern; modifies the executable filename before running",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python snippet that fetches code from a remote URL and executes it. It then spawns a new process running the current Python interpreter with the temporary file. This process allows remote code execution without any validation, which could be malicious. The use of _system with a modified executable name and the download from a suspicious URL strongly indicates malicious intent. The code appears designed to run remote code stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically fetches and executes remote code and then spawns it as a new process, which is a common pattern for malicious activity such as remote code execution. The behavior suggests high malicious intent with security risks. It should be considered highly dangerous.",
