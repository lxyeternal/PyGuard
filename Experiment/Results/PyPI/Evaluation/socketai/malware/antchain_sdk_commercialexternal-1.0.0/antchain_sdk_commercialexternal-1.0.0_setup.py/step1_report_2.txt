  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests library for HTTP requests, socket for hostname, getpass for username, os for current working directory.",
  "sinks": "requests.get call sending data to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent or notification. No validation or safeguards are present. The URL appears suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers system data (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially malicious. The URL used is suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not sanitize or restrict the data sent and operates transparently to the user, raising concerns about privacy and security risks. No obfuscated code or backdoors are present; however, the behavior itself is covert and malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code embeds malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. It uses standard libraries for system info collection and makes an external network request, which is a typical pattern for data theft or tracking. Overall, this is malicious activity embedded in a setup script.",
