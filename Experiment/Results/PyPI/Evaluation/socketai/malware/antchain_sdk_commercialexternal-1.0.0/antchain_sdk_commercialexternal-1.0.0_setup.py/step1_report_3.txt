{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which could be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is gathered (source) and sent over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL used is a known domain for data collection or malicious purposes. No safeguards or user prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom install command that executes after the standard installation. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with this data. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or user tracking, which is inappropriate in a setup script. The use of requests to send system data silently during package installation is suspicious. No other malicious actions (like executing shell commands or modifying files) are evident, but the data collection itself is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting system information during package installation and sending it to an external server without user consent. This indicates a potential supply chain attack aimed at user tracking or data theft.",
