{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL",
  "flows": "source variables (hostname, cwd, username) passed as URL parameters to requests.get() during setup.py install",
  "anomalies": "Network request executed during package installation, sending system info to an external server without user consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, gathers system info and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request to a suspicious URL during package installation. This behavior is unusual and indicates malicious intent, as it silently collects user environment data without notification. The code uses standard libraries (socket, getpass, os, requests) in a malicious context. The network activity during setup is a red flag for supply chain attack vectors. The code is clear and not obfuscated, making detection straightforward. The exfiltration of system info can be used for fingerprinting, tracking, or further malicious activities. The hardcoded URL suggests an attacker-controlled server. Overall, this is a clear case of malicious activity, specifically data theft during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It should be classified as malware with high severity due to its role in a supply chain attack. The activity is straightforward, not obfuscated, and involves sending system info to an external server without user consent. The malicious behavior warrants a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk score of 1.0, reflecting the high threat level.",
