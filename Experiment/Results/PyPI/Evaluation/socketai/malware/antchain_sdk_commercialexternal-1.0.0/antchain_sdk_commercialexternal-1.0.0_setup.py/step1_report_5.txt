{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Imports 'socket', 'getpass', 'os', and 'requests'; reads hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call sends collected system information to an external domain, acting as a network exfiltration sink.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without any user notification or consent; use of external domain for data transfer; no explanation provided for data collection purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup script to include a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system data and sends it to an external URL. The use of socket, getpass, and os modules to collect hostname, current directory, and username is normal, but the immediate network request to an external server during installation is suspicious. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is not typical for package installation. No other malicious code, backdoors, or harmful actions are present. The external URL appears to be used for data collection, possibly malicious if used without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, indicating an active attempt at data collection without user consent. This constitutes supply chain malicious behavior and should be considered unsafe for use.",
