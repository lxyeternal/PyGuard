{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script installs a Python package and executes custom behavior during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "Source: Collects hostname, cwd, username -> Sink: Sends data to remote server through requests.get() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of a network request in setup script that exfiltrates system info without user consent; use of hardcoded URL; potential for data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, gathers system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends this data to an external URL. This behavior is not typical for a standard setup script and suggests malicious data exfiltration. The use of requests in a setup script can be exploited for malicious purposes, especially if the URL is controlled by an attacker. No other suspicious code or obfuscation present. The network activity is initiated during package installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, indicating possible malicious intent or data leakage. The code is suspicious due to its unconventional behavior and network activity embedded in a package setup process.",
