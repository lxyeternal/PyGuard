  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "sources (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() to exfiltrate data",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of data exfiltration code within a setup script; sending system info to an external server during installation; use of hardcoded external URL; overriding install method to perform network request",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior is embedded in the setup script, which is executed during package installation. The data exfiltration occurs without user consent or awareness. Such behavior is typical of malicious supply chain attacks or data theft mechanisms. The external URL is hardcoded, and the code uses common system libraries, making it easy to integrate malicious behavior stealthily. There are no other suspicious or obfuscated elements; the code is straightforward but performs covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation. It appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection, indicating a high security risk. This code should not be used as-is, and the package is potentially malicious.",
