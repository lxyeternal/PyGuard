      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It should be classified as malware with high severity due to its role in a supply chain attack. The activity is straightforward, not obfuscated, and involves sending system info to an external server without user consent. The malicious behavior warrants a malware score of 1.0 and a security risk score of 1.0, reflecting the high threat level."
