      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and performs system modifications, privilege checks, and package installations in a manner consistent with malicious or backdoor malware. The heavy obfuscation, combined with system API calls and file manipulations, strongly indicates malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the code should be treated as malicious or suspicious. It is recommended to quarantine or remove this package and conduct further analysis in a secure environment."
