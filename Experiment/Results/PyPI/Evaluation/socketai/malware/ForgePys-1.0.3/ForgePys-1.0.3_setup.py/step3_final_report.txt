  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() call setting package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Email address used as description; empty 'url' and 'license' fields; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code. Metadata fields are incomplete but not security issues. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Dependency on 'cryptography' is standard. No input/output or network activity present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports, with malware scores at 0 and very low security risk scores mainly due to incomplete metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Metadata issues are minor and do not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible.",
