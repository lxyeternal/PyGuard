  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. License and URL fields are empty, which might be incomplete but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script specifying package metadata and dependencies. The only dependency is 'cryptography==40.0.2', a common security library. No external input handling, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are observed. The empty 'url' and 'license' fields are likely incomplete but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign, standard package configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
