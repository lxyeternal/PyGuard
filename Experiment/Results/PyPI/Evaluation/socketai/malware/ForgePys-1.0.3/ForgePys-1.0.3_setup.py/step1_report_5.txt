  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the ForgePys Python module with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and dependencies; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only declares static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools setup to define package information and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets beyond author info, and no external data input. The dependency on 'cryptography==40.0.2' is a common security library. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code inclusion are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python packaging.",
