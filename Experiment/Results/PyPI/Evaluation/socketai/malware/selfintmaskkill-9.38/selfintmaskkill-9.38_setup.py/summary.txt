  "conclusion": "The code executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during package setup, conditioned on filesystem state, with a comment referencing a suspicious domain. The use of encoded commands, silent execution, and external URL strongly suggest malicious intent. The high obfuscation and execution context justify elevated malware and risk scores. Decoding the payload could provide further confirmation, but current evidence indicates a high probability of malicious behavior, warranting caution and potential flagging as malicious."
