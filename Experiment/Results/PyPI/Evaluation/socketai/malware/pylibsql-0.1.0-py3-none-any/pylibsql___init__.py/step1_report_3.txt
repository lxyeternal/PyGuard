{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, browser history, and other system information, then exfiltrate this data via webhook and upload to external servers. It also includes malicious modules for file collection, process termination, and environment checks.",
  "sources": "User input and environment variables (e.g., clipboard, environment variables), browser files (local storage, cookies, passwords), system commands, process lists, network requests to gather tokens, cookies, and system info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external webhook URLs, file uploads, network requests to validate tokens, system commands for process termination, file copying and zipping for exfiltration, clipboard modification to replace wallet addresses, deletion of process and system files.",
  "flows": "Clipboard data is monitored for cryptocurrency addresses; browser data (cookies, passwords, history, credit cards) is copied and decrypted then sent; tokens are extracted from browser and other data, validated via API, and stored; all gathered data is then uploaded via webhook or anonymously to file sharing services.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation of certain strings and use of external URLs (e.g., realbatman.com, kekwltd.ru). The code installs multiple packages at runtime without verification. Multiple system checks for VMs, processes, and environment indicators suggest anti-analysis measures. The code terminates known debugging and analysis tools, manipulates clipboard contents to replace wallet addresses, and creates numerous temporary files for data exfiltration. Also, it automatically runs on startup, hides itself, and gathers extensive user system info.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer with capabilities to extract browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and clipboard data. It utilizes system commands and decrypts data securely stored in browser profiles. It terminates known debugging tools and virtual machine indicators to evade detection. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and anonymously uploads files. The code employs obfuscation techniques, external URL references, and runtime package installations. It also modifies clipboard contents to impersonate wallet addresses, likely to redirect funds or for privacy invasion. The malicious behaviors are consistent throughout the code, targeting user privacy, credentials, and cryptocurrency assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is clearly malicious, acting as a data exfiltration malware, collecting sensitive information from browsers, system, and clipboard, then transmitting it externally. It uses obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques to evade detection. Given its behavior, it poses a severe security threat and should be considered malware.",
