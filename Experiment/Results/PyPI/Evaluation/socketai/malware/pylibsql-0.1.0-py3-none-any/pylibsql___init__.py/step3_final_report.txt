{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info stealer and backdoor, collecting system info, browser credentials (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), tokens (Discord, Roblox), clipboard wallet addresses, and geolocation data, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and anonymous uploads. It also attempts to disable security tools, persist via startup registration, and obfuscate its activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COMPUTERNAME, APPDATA, TEMP), browser data files (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), clipboard data, system commands (UUID, product info), network info (IP, geolocation), process list, registry queries.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhooks, file uploads to anonymous hosts, writing logs and exfiltrated data locally, process termination commands, ZIP archive creation for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, browser data, clipboard, network info) are decrypted or read, then sent via network requests (webhooks, uploads). Decrypted credentials and tokens are stored temporarily and uploaded. Data flows from collection points to exfiltration points, with process-killing routines and persistence mechanisms integrated.",
  "anomalies": "Installing numerous dependencies dynamically, hardcoded external URLs, extensive process termination routines targeting security tools, obfuscation via encrypted URLs and misleading comments, redundant code blocks, self-deletion routines, and manipulation of browser data directories.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data theft: decrypts stored browser passwords and cookies, harvests tokens from various browsers, captures system info, and exfiltrates via webhooks and anonymous hosting. It kills security processes, disables protections, manipulates browser data, and employs obfuscation tactics like encrypted URLs and random filenames. It also creates ZIP archives of collected data for exfiltration. The code's structure and behaviors align with typical malware designed for stealth, persistence, and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer and backdoor with multiple evasion and sabotage techniques. Its behaviors—credential theft, token harvesting, system info exfiltration, process termination, and persistence—confirm its high threat level.",
