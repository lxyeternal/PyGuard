{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious information stealer and remote access tool designed to exfiltrate user data, including browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and files, and send it to a remote server or webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads user environment variables, Chrome/Firefox/Edge browser data, clipboard content, files in user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), and system information via subprocess and registry queries.",
  "sinks": "The code exfiltrates data by posting to remote webhooks (Discord) and upload services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), and writes collected data to local files before transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser data, clipboard, environment variables, and local files into in-memory variables, decrypted or processed, then sent via HTTP POST requests to remote servers or uploaded files; some data is also stored temporarily on disk.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes mass installation of dependencies via os.system, attempts to kill security-related processes, bypassing antivirus and debugger detection, decrypting browser passwords/cookies with master keys, creating random files/directories, and exfiltrating user data covertly. Presence of many hardcoded URLs, tokens, and process names for antivirus and security tools suggests sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The script is highly suspicious and malicious. It installs numerous Python libraries, likely to evade detection or facilitate exfiltration. It collects detailed system info, browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and clipboard data. It includes functions to decrypt sensitive data, scan for security tools/processes, and gather files matching keywords. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads. The code also attempts to disable security processes, hide its presence, and run persistently on startup. The complexity, obfuscation, and targeted data collection strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as an information-stealing trojan targeting browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and system info. It exfiltrates data to remote servers, attempts to evade detection, and includes sabotage mechanisms. Use of hardcoded URLs, tokens, and process names confirms its harmful nature. Overall, it poses a severe security risk and should be blocked and removed immediately.",
