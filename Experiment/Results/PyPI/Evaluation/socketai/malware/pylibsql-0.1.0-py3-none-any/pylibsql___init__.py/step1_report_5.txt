{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities such as data theft, credential harvesting, system information gathering, and exfiltration of sensitive data, including passwords, cookies, tokens, and system info, to a remote server or webhook. It also includes functionalities to collect browser data, steal cookies, passwords, history, credit card info, and Roblox/Roblox cookies, along with creating ZIP archives of collected data for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, browser data folders, SQLite databases for cookies, passwords, history, credit cards, browser local state files for master keys, clipboard contents for wallet addresses, and process lists for running processes.",
  "sinks": "The code posts data to external URLs (notably 'https://realbatman.com/') and Discord webhooks, uploads files to anonfiles.com and transfer.sh, and sends collected information such as system info, tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data over network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, environment variables, clipboard, and process lists through various functions that decrypt, read, and extract data, which is then sent via HTTP POST requests or uploaded files to remote servers. The code also terminates processes, creates ZIP files, and deletes local copies after exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple hardcoded URLs, webhooks, and email addresses, use of obfuscated or confusing variable names, presence of functions to kill processes (e.g., 'taskkill' for Chrome and Discord processes), the collection of system info, and the inclusion of various browser and system data extraction routines all point towards malicious intent. The code also uses techniques to hide its presence by deleting files and terminating processes, and it employs multiple layers of obfuscation (e.g., random folder names, complex regex patterns, and encrypted data handling).",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer designed for Windows. It gathers browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), tokens from Discord and other Chromium-based browsers, Roblox cookies, system info, IP details, and clipboard data (wallet addresses). It decrypts stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API, extracts tokens via regex, and exfiltrates data to external URLs via HTTP POST, including Discord webhooks and file uploads. The code also attempts to terminate security or analysis processes (e.g., process names like 'ida64', 'wireshark', 'regedit', 'taskmgr'), checks for virtual machine environments, and hides itself by removing files and killing processes. Furthermore, it creates ZIP archives of all collected data before uploading. There are multiple indications of malicious behavior, including credential theft, system info harvesting, process termination, data exfiltration, and the presence of obfuscation techniques. The code's overall intent is clearly malicious, targeting sensitive user data with stealthy collection and exfiltration methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It actively collects and decrypts stored passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and clipboard data, then exfiltrates the data to external servers and Discord webhooks. It also kills security-related processes and creates ZIP archives of the stolen data for transfer. The presence of obfuscation, hardcoded URLs, process termination, and comprehensive data harvesting indicates a high malicious intent. The overall security risk score is very high, and the malware likelihood is almost certain.",
