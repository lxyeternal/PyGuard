{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer and remote access tool. It collects sensitive information including cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and files, and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads, also executing persistence mechanisms and process termination to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), user input via clipboard, filesystem (Chrome, Firefox, other browsers, and specific directories), process enumeration, network requests to external URLs, reading local configuration files, reading browser databases (Login Data, Cookies, History, Credit Cards).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs (via httpx, requests, urlopen), writing data to files, file uploads to external servers, process termination commands, registry queries, process kills, message box display, system commands (e.g., kill processes, copy files).",
  "flows": "Sources like clipboard data, filesystem reads (browsers, cookies, passwords, history) flow into decryption routines and are then sent via network requests or saved into files. System info and token validation flow into data compilation and exfiltration. Process enumeration and process kills flow into evasion routines. Config data guides operational behavior. Data from browsers and system info are collected, processed, and uploaded or posted via webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL pointing to suspicious domain (realbatman.com), repeated attempts to install many Python packages via os.system pip install commands, extensive use of private and potentially malicious URLs, persistent process-killing routines targeting common security tools, and code that self-removes or terminates processes that may hinder operation. The code includes hardcoded, obfuscated, and misleading comments, as well as functions designed for deception (e.g., fake error messages).",
  "analysis": "The script begins by installing numerous Python packages, indicating preparation for complex operations. It collects system information, browser data (cookies, passwords, history, credit cards), and user tokens from various applications including Discord, Roblox, and browsers. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptography APIs. It gathers network info, geolocation, and system details, then compiles all data into ZIP archives and uploads them via webhook or transfer.sh. It includes mechanisms to hide itself at startup, terminate security processes, and modify browser data files (e.g., replacing webhook URLs). It also performs file searching for potentially sensitive files based on keyword matching, uploads them anonymously, and reports findings. Throughout, it employs threading for concurrency, obfuscates some URLs and paths, and contains redundant, suspicious system calls. There are no signs of remote command-and-control infrastructure beyond exfiltration endpoints, but the code’s intent to steal credentials, cookies, tokens, and other sensitive data, then send it to external servers, classifies it as malicious. The code appears designed to evade detection and remove traces after execution, further indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system compromise. It systematically harvests user credentials, tokens, cookies, browser history, and files, then uploads or sends this information to external servers. It employs persistence, evasion, and obfuscation techniques. The overall security risk is high, with substantial threat to user privacy and system security.",
