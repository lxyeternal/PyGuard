{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activities including information theft, credential harvesting, system and browser data exfiltration, cryptocurrency wallet theft, and unauthorized monitoring or backdooring of the infected system.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), system commands, local files (browser data, system info), clipboard content, and network requests to external URLs. It reads browser storage databases, Windows registry keys, process lists, and user input (clipboard).",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve sending data via HTTP POST requests to specified webhook URLs, writing files locally and then uploading them to external servers, executing system commands (e.g., killing processes, modifying startup), and capturing system and user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, history, and screenshots.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (browser files, environment variables, clipboard, system info) through decryption and parsing functions, then to network requests for exfiltration, and finally to local file storage or uploads. For example, browser cookies/passwords are decrypted, stored, and uploaded via webhooks. Tokens are validated and stored for exfiltration. System info is collected and sent to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include installing numerous packages via 'pip install' at runtime, collecting and exfiltrating browser data, cookies, passwords, system info, and clipboard data without user consent, using hardcoded webhook URLs, and attempting to disable or kill security or monitoring processes (e.g., process termination of known security tools). The code also manipulates browser data directories, monitors process lists for specific process names, and uploads files to anonymous hosting services.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by installing numerous dependencies, likely to ensure it can operate across various environments. It gathers system info, user data, and browser credentials by decrypting stored data from Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers, then exfiltrates this data to specified webhooks. It also attempts to manipulate or disable security software and processes, potentially to maintain persistence or avoid detection. The code uses obfuscation tactics, such as dynamic code execution, large blocks of seemingly redundant or misleading code, and encrypted/decrypted payloads. It performs extensive data collection, including system info, tokens, cookies, passwords, history, and even screenshots, which it then zips and uploads. It manipulates clipboard data to potentially hijack cryptocurrency addresses. Overall, the code is clearly designed for malicious purposes, including theft of sensitive information, system sabotage, and covert communication with command and control servers.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, exhibiting behaviors typical of information-stealing malware, credential harvesting, system sabotage, and data exfiltration. It includes multiple methods for collecting, decrypting, and transmitting user and system data, as well as disabling security measures and maintaining persistence. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, extensive system and browser data access, and operational features such as process termination confirm its malicious intent.",
