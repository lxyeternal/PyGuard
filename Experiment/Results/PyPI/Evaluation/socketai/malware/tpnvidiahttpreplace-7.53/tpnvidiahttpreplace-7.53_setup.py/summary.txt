  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, with silent error suppression and hidden execution. The presence of the URL comment and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious."
