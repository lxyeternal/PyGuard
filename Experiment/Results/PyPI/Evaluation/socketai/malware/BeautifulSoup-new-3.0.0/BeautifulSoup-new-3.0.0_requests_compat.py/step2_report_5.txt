  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code to verify accuracy and consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs version checks, conditional imports for compatibility, and handles optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data handling that could lead to security issues.\n- The logic is straightforward, primarily static imports and compatibility adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly states that the module manages compatibility, imports, and handles optional dependencies. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Accurately describes the import logic, version checks, and the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as standard compatibility boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Correctly notes the purpose, imports, version info, and fallback mechanisms. No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Appropriately describes the import handling, version checks, and lack of data flow or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the purpose, import logic, and compatibility handling. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as a compatibility and import management module.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is standard and does not introduce security risks.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is a typical, safe compatibility utility module.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard compatibility layer with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
