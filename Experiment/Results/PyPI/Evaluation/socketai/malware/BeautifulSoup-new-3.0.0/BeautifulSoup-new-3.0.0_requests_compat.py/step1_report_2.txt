  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing necessary modules for HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and assigns built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no user input, network data, or external data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "This code only performs imports and type aliasing; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports and assigns type aliases; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with compatibility and importing modules, which is standard practice. It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', handles JSON library imports with fallback, and defines compatibility types. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or code execution beyond imports. Overall, it appears to be a standard, well-structured compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility module for Python 2/3 and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and typical for such utility modules.",
