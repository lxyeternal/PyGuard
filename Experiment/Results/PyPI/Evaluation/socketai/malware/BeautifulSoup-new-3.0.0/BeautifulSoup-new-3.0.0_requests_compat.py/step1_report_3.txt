{
  "purpose": "This module handles Python version compatibility and imports for HTTP and JSON handling, ensuring backward compatibility across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and system version info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted input leading to data leaks or code execution. No data is written to external systems or network communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily imports modules and sets compatibility flags without processing external data or executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules to handle compatibility issues between Python versions, such as conditional imports and version checks. It gracefully falls back if certain modules like 'simplejson' are not available. The use of version info and conditional imports is typical for maintaining cross-version support. No external data handling, network communication, or potentially dangerous code constructs are present. All actions are standard and for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate for Python 2 and 3 support. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for ensuring code compatibility.",
