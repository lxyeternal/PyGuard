  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a typical compatibility layer, handling Python version differences, optional dependencies, and standard library imports.\n- No dynamic data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present.\n- The code uses conditional imports and version checks, which are standard practices.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports uniformly state that the code is a standard compatibility and import management module.\n- They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, no malicious code, and no data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- They acknowledge the use of conditional imports and version checks as typical and safe.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated and malware scores are 0, consistent with the code content.\n\n**Any discrepancies or issues?**\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores are reasonable; given the code's purpose, a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0 are appropriate.\n- The analysis correctly dismisses any suspicion of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs environment detection and conditional imports, which are common in compatibility modules.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate and align with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate, and there is no need for adjustments.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and assessments. The code is safe, standard compatibility boilerplate, with no security concerns.",
