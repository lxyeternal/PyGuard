{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and manages imports of various standard libraries for use in requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, try-except block for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', standard library modules like json, collections, http, io, urllib",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code mainly handles imports and compatibility checks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code performs static imports and version checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected; the code follows typical compatibility and import patterns",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring explaining the purpose of the module. It then attempts to import 'chardet' and falls back to 'charset_normalizer' if unavailable, which is a standard practice. It checks Python version info to set flags for Python 2 or 3. It conditionally imports 'simplejson' as 'json' for extended JSON support, otherwise defaults to the built-in json module. It imports standard collections modules and HTTP handling modules. The code defines some string and numeric type aliases for compatibility. All operations are static imports and version checks with no data processing or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility module that manages imports and Python version checks without any malicious intent or security risks. It follows common best practices for handling backward compatibility and standard library imports.",
