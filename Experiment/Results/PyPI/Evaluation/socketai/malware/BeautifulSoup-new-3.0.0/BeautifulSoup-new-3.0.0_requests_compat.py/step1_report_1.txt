{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and manages imports for various modules like json, chardet, and urllib, mainly for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), conditional imports of external libraries (chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that handles untrusted data or user input that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within standard library imports and conditional imports; no dynamic execution or data processing is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. Use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, conditional imports, and compatibility adjustments. It imports standard libraries and handles optional third-party dependencies gracefully. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code lacks network activity, data manipulation, or execution of untrusted data. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility and import management module for Python projects. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
