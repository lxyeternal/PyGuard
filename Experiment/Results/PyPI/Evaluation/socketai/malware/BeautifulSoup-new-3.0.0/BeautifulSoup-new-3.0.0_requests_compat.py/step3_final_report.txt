{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 by managing imports and version checks.",
  "sources": "Version info via sys.version_info, import statements for modules like chardet, simplejson, json, and standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and version checks only.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static environment detection and import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection using sys.version_info, conditionally imports optional modules like chardet and simplejson, and sets up compatibility aliases for string types and data structures. It uses straightforward conditional logic and standard library imports without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling involving untrusted sources. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code is typical for maintaining backward compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured compatibility utility module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs environment detection and import management safely and effectively.",
