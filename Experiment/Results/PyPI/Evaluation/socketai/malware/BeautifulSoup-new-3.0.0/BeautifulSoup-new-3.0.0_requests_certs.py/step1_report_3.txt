{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, primarily for use in establishing SSL/TLS connections securely.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, which provides the path to the CA bundle file.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output; no untrusted data handling occurs beyond this display.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides a trusted CA bundle path, which is then printed; no flow of untrusted data from external sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the script simply retrieves and prints a standard certificate bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known, trusted library (certifi) and calls its 'where' function to output the CA bundle location. The script is straightforward, with no user input or untrusted data processing. It serves as a utility to reveal the CA bundle path, which is safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a minimal utility script for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to a trusted CA bundle. There are no security risks, malware, or suspicious behavior present. It is safe and standard in purpose.",
