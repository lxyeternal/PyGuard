  "purpose": "To return the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the certifi package, calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "The code imports the 'where' function (source), executes it, and outputs its result (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code simply outputs a file path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi' to retrieve the CA bundle path. It then prints this path when executed directly. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. The code performs a straightforward utility function with no external data processing or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the CA bundle used by 'requests'. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
