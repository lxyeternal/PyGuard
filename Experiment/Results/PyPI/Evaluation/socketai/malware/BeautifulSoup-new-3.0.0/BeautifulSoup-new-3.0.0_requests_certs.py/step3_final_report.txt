  "purpose": "This script outputs the file path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed",
  "flows": "Source (import of 'where') to sink (print output)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward utility code with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign utility that imports a standard library function and prints its result. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any secrets. The purpose is to provide the location of the CA bundle, which is common in SSL-related scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's simplicity and the absence of external data handling indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility with no malicious intent or security issues. All indicators suggest a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The high confidence score of 1 reflects the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
