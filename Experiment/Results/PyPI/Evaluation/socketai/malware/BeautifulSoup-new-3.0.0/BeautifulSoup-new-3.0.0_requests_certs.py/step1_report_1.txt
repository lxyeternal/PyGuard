{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function import.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data input or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path and outputs it via 'print()'. There are no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' to determine the path to the CA bundle. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is simple, does not process untrusted input, and only outputs a static or environment-dependent path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the location of the CA bundle from 'certifi'. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
