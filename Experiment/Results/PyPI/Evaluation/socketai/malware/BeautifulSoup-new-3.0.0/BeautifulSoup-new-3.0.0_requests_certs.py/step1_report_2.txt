{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA bundle provided by the certifi package, typically used for SSL/TLS verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi module via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (the CA bundle path) could be used by other code that handles network requests or SSL verification.",
  "flows": "The script calls certifi.where() to obtain the CA bundle path, then prints it; the data flow is straightforward from the certifi library to the standard output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is simple, standard, and explicitly documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' library and, when run as a script, prints the path to the CA bundle. The module is documented to be used for packaging or environment customization but does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is straightforward, serving a single, benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of supply chain attacks or malicious code are detected.",
