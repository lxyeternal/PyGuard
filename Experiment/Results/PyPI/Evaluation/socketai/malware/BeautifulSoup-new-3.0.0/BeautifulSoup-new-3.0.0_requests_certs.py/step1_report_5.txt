{
  "purpose": "The script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path used by the requests library, primarily for use in packaging or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output (CA bundle path) could be used by other programs or scripts that read this output for network security purposes.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) provides data that is printed; this data could be used downstream by any process that captures the printed output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and only involves importing a known function and printing its result.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package to retrieve the default CA bundle path. It then prints this path if executed as the main program. There are no user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code serves a simple utility purpose, and the use of certifi is standard practice for CA bundle management in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the CA certificate bundle used by requests. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
