  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, providing descriptive information about the package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package attributes such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emoji string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static assignment of metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art and emoji string are purely aesthetic; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with package metadata. No dynamic code, input handling, external data sources, or executable logic are present. The ASCII art and emoji are harmless decorative elements. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, with high confidence (1). The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign and standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
