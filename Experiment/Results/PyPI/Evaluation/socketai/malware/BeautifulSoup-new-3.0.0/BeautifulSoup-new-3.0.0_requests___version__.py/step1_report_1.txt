  "purpose": "Define metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and integer literals to module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard package metadata definition.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static assignments of metadata variables describing the package, such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, and no external data handling. The code appears to be part of a standard package metadata module, typical in Python projects. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply assigns descriptive information to module variables.",
