  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and compatibility checks for the 'requests' library, ensuring correct versions and fallback configurations.",
  "sources": "Static version strings imported from dependencies, environment detection for SSL support, and internal assertions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Version variables are checked against static assertions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; assertions are static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version checks, compatibility assertions, SSL fallback configuration, and warning management. All operations are static, do not process untrusted input, and serve environment setup purposes. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The version assertions are standard and unlikely to be exploited. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical setup scripts for a well-known library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup and compatibility script for the 'requests' library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate and justified.",
