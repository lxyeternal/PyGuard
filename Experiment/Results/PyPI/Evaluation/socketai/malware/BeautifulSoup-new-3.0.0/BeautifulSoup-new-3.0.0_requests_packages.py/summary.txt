  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a compatibility shim involving dynamic sys.modules manipulations. While techniques used are unusual and could be exploited, there is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.3, security risk: 0.3) are justified. It warrants cautious review if used in supply chain contexts but is benign in its present form."
