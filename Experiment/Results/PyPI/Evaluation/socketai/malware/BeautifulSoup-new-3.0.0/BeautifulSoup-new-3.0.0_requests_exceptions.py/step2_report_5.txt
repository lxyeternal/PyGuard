  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, check for inconsistencies, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for the Requests library.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external data sources are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The code structure is straightforward, with standard inheritance and class definitions.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the clear, readable code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms standard exception class definitions, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same as above, emphasizes no data flow or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Reinforces the standard nature of the code, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same reasoning, no suspicious elements.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous assessments, straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed; it's a standard exception hierarchy module.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; scores are correct.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores are correct.\n- **Security risk:** None; scores are correct.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is purely structural and does not process untrusted data or execute code dynamically.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and without security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final verdict:** No issues found; the code is safe.",
