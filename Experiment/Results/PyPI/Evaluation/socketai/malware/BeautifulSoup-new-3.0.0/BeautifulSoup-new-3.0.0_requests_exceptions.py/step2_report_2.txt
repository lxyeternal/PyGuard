  "review": "Let's proceed step-by-step to analyze these reports and the underlying code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data sources are involved.\n   - All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or imported exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n   - The code contains only class definitions, imports, and docstrings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and defensive, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the analysis.\n   - The conclusion that the code is standard and safe is justified based on the provided source.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as expected.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the code justify a higher risk score.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or execute untrusted code.\n   - Therefore, a high risk score would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors, a malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be considered malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely defining exception classes.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports' analyses are accurate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard.\n- No modifications to the scores are needed.\n- The code should be considered secure and benign from a supply chain perspective.",
