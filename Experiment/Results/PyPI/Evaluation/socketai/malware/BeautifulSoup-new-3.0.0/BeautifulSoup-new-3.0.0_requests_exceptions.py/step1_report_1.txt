{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, primarily for handling various error conditions during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all classes are exception definitions. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; exception classes are not executing potentially dangerous code or data flows.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this code solely declares exception classes without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from external modules and defines custom exception classes for handling HTTP request errors in the Requests library. All classes inherit from standard Python exception hierarchies and do not contain any executable code beyond class definitions. The structure appears standard for a Python exception module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. No input/output, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code strictly serves as an exception hierarchy for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious exception class definition for the Requests library. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The code is well-structured and contains no suspicious or anomalous elements.",
