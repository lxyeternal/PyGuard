{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library, handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import of urllib3.exceptions and local compatibility module; class definitions that inherit from standard exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; exception classes do not process external input or perform actions.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and initialization methods; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; straightforward class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and imported exceptions. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or external data inputs. The import statements and class structures are typical for a Python error-handling module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error handling in the Requests library. The consistent scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified by the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy module for the Requests library. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
