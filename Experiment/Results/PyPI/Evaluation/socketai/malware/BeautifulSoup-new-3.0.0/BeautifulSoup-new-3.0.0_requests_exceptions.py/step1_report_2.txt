{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported exception classes and defines new exception classes; no input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; it only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the code only establishes class hierarchies and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code structure and class definitions are standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes for the Requests library, inheriting from built-in exceptions and other imported exceptions. No data processing, user input handling, or network operations are present. All classes are straightforward, with clear docstrings. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears to serve as a standard error handling module without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class definition module for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
