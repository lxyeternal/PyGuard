{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Code reads only static class definitions and imports; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to security-critical functions; the code is solely class definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code strictly defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes custom exception classes for the requests library, importing exceptions from other modules and defining subclasses for various HTTP and connection errors. No input handling, data processing, or external communications occur within this code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic are present. The code structure is standard for a library's exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "This source code consists solely of exception class definitions and import statements without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be legitimate, standard code for error handling within the requests library.",
