{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, including request preparation, encoding, headers, cookies, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (headers, data, files, json, params, cookies, auth), URL parsing, and response raw stream.",
  "sinks": "Request payloads, headers, cookies, URL, response content, and JSON decoding.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request construction, encoding, and headers; response content flows into decoding and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, typical implementation of an HTTP client. It handles encoding, URL parsing, headers, cookies, and response decoding securely. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The request and response handling follow standard practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure HTTP client implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The risk and malware scores are justified as zero, and the obfuscation score is zero. The overall security posture is very good.",
