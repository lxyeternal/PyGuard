  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments to identify any discrepancies, potential risks, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility for cookie management, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer finds no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The functions are typical for cookie handling.\n- **Assessment:** This aligns well with the code, which is a well-structured, standard cookie utility module.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes no suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps due to the nature of cookie management being potentially misused, but no specific vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Assessment:** The code does not perform any network activity or malicious operations; the risk score seems conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious signals; malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cookie management functions, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The functions are typical, and no suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code, which is utility-focused.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious network calls.\n- **Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct given the code's functionality.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low and justified since the code manages cookies—an area that could be misused if integrated into malicious payloads, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the nature of cookie management but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, well-implemented cookie utility module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The scores are reasonable and justified.  \n- No further action needed; the code is safe and legitimate.",
