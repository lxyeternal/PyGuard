  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for cookie handling, including extraction, header creation, and cookie jar management.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, request URL parsing, cookie attributes, internal utils.",
  "sinks": "Request headers, response headers, cookie storage, cookie header generation.",
  "flows": "Request headers and URL data flow into cookie extraction and header creation; response headers are parsed into cookies; cookies are stored and retrieved from the jar.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, standard cookie management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured cookie management utilities compatible with Python's cookielib and requests. It handles cookie extraction, creation, header management, and jar operations without any network activity or malicious patterns. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The functions are typical for cookie handling and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for cookie management with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
