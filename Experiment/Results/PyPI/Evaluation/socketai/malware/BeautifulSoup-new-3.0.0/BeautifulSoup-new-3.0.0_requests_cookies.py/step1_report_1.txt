{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in requests, including cookie extraction, cookie header generation, and a dict-like CookieJar implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as calendar, copy, time, threading, and internal utils; functions and class methods that read request headers, cookie data, and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Methods that access or modify cookie data, headers, or internal states, including get_header(), add_unredirected_header(), extract_cookies_to_jar(), and set_cookie().",
  "flows": "Request data is read in get_cookie_header(), request headers are accessed in MockRequest, response headers in extract_cookies_to_jar(), and cookie data flows through set_cookie(), update(), and get() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious external calls are present. The code strictly manages cookie data and internal state, with no network communication, file access, or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code offers utility classes for cookie management, including a mock request and response to facilitate cookie handling with urllib and requests. It implements standard cookie parsing, creation, and management functions without any indication of malicious activity. The functions perform expected operations like extracting cookies from responses, generating cookie headers, and managing cookies within a jar. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, are present. All imported modules and operations are standard for cookie handling and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility library for cookie management compatible with requests and urllib. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks, and functions as intended for safe cookie handling. No malware signals detected.",
