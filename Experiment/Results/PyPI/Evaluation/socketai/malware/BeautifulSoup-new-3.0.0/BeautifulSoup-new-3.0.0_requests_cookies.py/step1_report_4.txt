  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (e.g., _internal_utils, compat), and functions that handle request and response headers, cookie creation, and cookie jar management.",
  "sinks": "Methods that add headers to requests, extract cookies from responses, and manipulate cookie jars; particularly in functions like get_cookie_header, extract_cookies_to_jar, and set/set_cookie.",
  "flows": "Request object is wrapped in MockRequest, which provides headers and URL info; cookies are extracted from response headers into a CookieJar; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies can be added, removed, or merged into jars.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; functions appear to be standard cookie management utilities. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications detected. Usage of threading.RLock is standard for thread safety.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility wrappers and utility functions for cookie handling within the requests library, including mock request/response classes, cookie extraction, cookie creation, and jar manipulation. All operations are focused on cookie management and header handling without any network activity or malicious payloads. No suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage are present. The code does not perform any external network communications or access sensitive data. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be standard, intended for cookie management support, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for handling cookies in the requests library, with no signs of malicious activity or security threats. It correctly implements cookie extraction, header creation, and jar management functions typical of cookie handling utilities. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
