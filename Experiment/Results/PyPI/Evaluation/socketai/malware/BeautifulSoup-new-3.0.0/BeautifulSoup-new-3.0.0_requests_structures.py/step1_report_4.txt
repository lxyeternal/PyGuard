{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary behavior and a simple lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), key access methods (__getitem__, get), and update methods (update).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as data is only stored in memory; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (through constructor or item assignment) flows into internal storage, accessed via __getitem__, __setitem__, or get.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and implements standard data structures.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard dictionary-like behavior with no external interactions or dynamic code execution. They do not perform network operations, execute code, or handle untrusted data beyond in-memory storage. The code appears to be a utility module for data handling within the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines safe, standard data structures used internally by the Requests library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and adheres to typical Python idioms.",
