  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data assignment (__setitem__), data retrieval (__getitem__, get), and iteration (__iter__, lower_items).",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval methods (__getitem__, get), iteration methods (__iter__, items()), and representation (__repr__).",
  "flows": "Input data to internal store in __init__, data to internal store in __setitem__, data retrieved via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Use of standard Python data structures and straightforward method implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures with no evidence of malicious intent. The classes provide case-insensitive dictionary behavior and a simple lookup dictionary, both with clear, benign methods. No external data leaks, no network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations are present. Methods follow typical patterns for custom dict-like objects. The overall design is consistent with their documented purpose. No anomalies or potential security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and a basic lookup dictionary used in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
