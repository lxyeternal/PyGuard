  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of internal data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security. Therefore, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
