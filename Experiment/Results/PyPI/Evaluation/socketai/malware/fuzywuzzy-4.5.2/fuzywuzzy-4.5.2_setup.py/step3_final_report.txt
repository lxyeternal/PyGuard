{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information, download a malicious executable, and execute it silently during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external suspicious URLs; downloads an executable file from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "Sends environment info to an external server; downloads and executes an untrusted executable via os.system; silent error handling conceals failures.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' → URL request to exfiltrate data; URL request to download executable → saving file locally → executing the file with os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling with 'try-except: pass'; use of suspicious URLs; downloading and executing unverified external code during setup; hardcoded filenames and URLs; no validation or user consent for execution.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly performs data exfiltration, downloads, and executes an external executable during package installation, all of which are classic malicious behaviors. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures. The URLs used are suspicious and untrusted. The execution of downloaded code without validation or user approval indicates malicious intent. The straightforward nature of the code and its behavior confirm it is malicious, with no obfuscation present. These activities pose a severe security risk, including remote code execution and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that exfiltrates system info, downloads, and executes untrusted payloads during installation. The behavior is consistent with malware, and the security risk is high. The malware score should be set to 1, and the overall security risk score should also be 1. The package should be flagged and avoided.",
