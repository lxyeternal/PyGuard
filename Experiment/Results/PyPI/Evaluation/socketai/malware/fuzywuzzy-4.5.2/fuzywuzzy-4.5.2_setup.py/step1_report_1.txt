{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'fuzywuzzy' and includes a post-installation step that executes the 'send' function.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP requests to external URLs. It also downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via 'os.system', making HTTP GET requests to external domains, and reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to construct a URL and is sent via a GET request. Based on platform detection, an executable is downloaded and executed, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to contact an external URL with environment data, downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain, and executes it without validation or user consent. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=...' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' are suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The try-except block suppresses errors silently, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script includes a 'send' function that gathers the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external server, potentially leaking system info. It also downloads an executable from a non-standard, suspicious URL and executes it silently on Windows systems, which could be malicious. The 'setup' configuration calls 'send' during installation, making it a potential supply chain attack vector. The external domains and behavior align with malware activity like data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment info, downloading, and executing an untrusted executable from suspicious domains. It is highly indicative of malware, designed to compromise systems during package installation.",
