  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'fuzywuzzy' with additional post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URLs in the send() function for remote requests.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing downloaded file; requests.get() to external URLs; writing to disk.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> requests.get() to external server -> download and execute a potentially malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; download and auto-execute an external file during post-install; no validation or verification of remote content; suspicious URL domains; unconditionally executing downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and adds a custom post-install command that executes the send() function. The send() function retrieves the COMPUTERNAME environment variable, makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, and if on Windows, downloads an executable file from an untrusted source and automatically executes it. This behavior resembles malicious activity, as it silently downloads and runs external code during package installation. The broad try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious intent. The use of external URLs, downloading executables, and executing them without verification are significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation, which can compromise user systems. The activity resembles malware and poses a high security risk.",
