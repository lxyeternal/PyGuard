{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom post-installation step that potentially downloads and executes a file from an external source.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr')",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) which executes the downloaded file",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data to external URL -> Downloads executable -> Executes the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except without handling exceptions, downloading and executing a file during installation, hardcoded URLs, and use of os.system to run external executable",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external URL, then downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it on Windows systems. The custom install command invokes this 'send' function during package installation. The URLs used are suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or information theft. The code's structure indicates an attempt to run external code without user consent, which is a security risk. The use of broad exception handling without logging or error handling further conceals malicious activity. The overall pattern suggests malicious intent, as it involves data exfiltration and remote code execution during setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info and executing a remote payload during package installation, indicating a high security risk with potential malware activity.",
