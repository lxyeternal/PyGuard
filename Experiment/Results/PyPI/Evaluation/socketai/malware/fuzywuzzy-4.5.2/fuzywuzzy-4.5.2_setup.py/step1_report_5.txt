{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an additional function designed to execute malicious activities during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and accesses external URLs via the requests library.",
  "sinks": "The code downloads and executes an external executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system, and sends data to a remote URL ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php') with the environment info.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server, then an executable is downloaded and executed, potentially installing malicious software.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function makes network requests to suspicious domains, sends environment info, and executes a downloaded file without validation. The URL domains appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package sources. The use of 'os.system' to run a downloaded executable is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools but includes a malicious function 'send' that, during installation, retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from a dubious domain and executes it automatically. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system info and install malicious code silently. The setup configuration includes a custom install command that triggers this behavior. No other benign or intended functionality is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior intended to exfiltrate system information and execute a malicious payload silently during package installation. The download URL and execution of an external executable constitute a high security risk, indicating malicious intent.",
