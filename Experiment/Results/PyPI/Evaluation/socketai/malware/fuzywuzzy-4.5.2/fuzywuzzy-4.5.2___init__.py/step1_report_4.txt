  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a simple function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data flow involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function 'ina' that prints a static string 'installed'. The function is invoked immediately after its definition. There are no external data inputs, no usage of environment variables, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The code performs a simple, benign operation without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It merely outputs a static message indicating installation status.",
