  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately.",
  "sources": "The function ina() which is called directly; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function call ina() leading to print() execution; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that outputs a static message and calls it immediately. No external data, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
