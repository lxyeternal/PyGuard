{
  "purpose": "Set up and package the Python project named 'xcryptography' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data for setuptools, including package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code solely involves package setup configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and uses setup() to define package name, version, and included packages. It employs find_packages() for automatic package discovery. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
