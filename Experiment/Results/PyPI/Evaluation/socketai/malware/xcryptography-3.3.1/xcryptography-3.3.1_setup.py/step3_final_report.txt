  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script for packaging the 'xcryptography' module.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external calls present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'xcryptography' resembles 'cryptography', which could be intended to mislead or impersonate a well-known library, but the code itself contains no malicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only notable aspect is the package name, which could be intended to deceive users. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) reflects the potential for misleading naming but does not indicate malicious activity. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only concern is the package name 'xcryptography', which could be used to mislead users but does not constitute a security risk at the code level.",
