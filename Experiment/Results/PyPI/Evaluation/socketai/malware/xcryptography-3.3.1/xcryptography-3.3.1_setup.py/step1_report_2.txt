{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and initiate the packaging process for a Python project named 'xcryptography'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, and the list of packages to include via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, as the inputs are hardcoded and static.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; the process only involves static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions and invokes setup() with fixed parameters. It uses find_packages() to automatically include all packages in the directory. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic data are involved. The script is minimal, straightforward, and typical for Python packaging, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'xcryptography'. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for package distribution.",
