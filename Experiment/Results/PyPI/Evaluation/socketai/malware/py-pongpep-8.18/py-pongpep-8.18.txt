      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in a conditional, silent manner. The pattern aligns with common malware delivery techniques. The scores should be adjusted to reflect high risk: malware at 0.8, obfuscation at 1, and overall security risk at 0.8. Further decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended before use or distribution."
