      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during package setup, indicative of a supply chain attack vector. The high scores are justified, and the package should be considered dangerous. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code poses a severe security risk and warrants immediate review and removal from distribution channels."
