  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup. The embedded URL and stealth techniques further support this. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate; the package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the payload."
