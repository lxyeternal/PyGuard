      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered conditionally, indicating malicious intent. The embedded command references a known suspicious URL and is executed stealthily. The overall behavior suggests a supply chain attack or backdoor mechanism. The package should be flagged for further review and not used in production environments."
