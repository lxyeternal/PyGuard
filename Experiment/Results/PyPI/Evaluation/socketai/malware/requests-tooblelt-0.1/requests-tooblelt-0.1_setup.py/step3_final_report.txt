  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, employing complex calculations, dynamic string assembly, and indirect attribute references to hide its true intent. It reads command-line arguments and environment variables, performs file system operations, and conditionally executes system commands such as pip package installation, shortcut creation, and privilege escalation checks. The logic includes multiple nested conditionals based on obscure, large integer calculations, which are likely designed to conceal malicious activities such as system modification, privilege escalation, and covert package management. The use of ctypes to check admin rights, creation of shortcuts, and silent package installation are typical behaviors associated with malware. The code's structure and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent, with high obfuscation scores and system-level interactions that could compromise system security if executed.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and system-intrusive. It employs techniques to hide its true purpose, including complex calculations, dynamic string assembly, and indirect function calls. It performs system modifications, privilege escalation checks, and package installations in a covert manner. The high scores for malware (1.0), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified by these behaviors. It should be treated as high threat and prevented from execution unless thoroughly analyzed and verified safe.",
