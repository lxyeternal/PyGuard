  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and system-intrusive. It employs techniques to hide its true purpose, including complex calculations, dynamic string assembly, and indirect function calls. It performs system modifications, privilege escalation checks, and package installations in a covert manner. The high scores for malware (1.0), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified by these behaviors. It should be treated as high threat and prevented from execution unless thoroughly analyzed and verified safe."
