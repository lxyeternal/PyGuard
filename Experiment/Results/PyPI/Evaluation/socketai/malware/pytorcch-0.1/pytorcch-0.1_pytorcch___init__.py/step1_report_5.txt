{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize and configure a web server, possibly to serve content or handle requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, command-line arguments, or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, or subprocess calls that could execute code or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input sources flows into server configuration, then potentially into network operations or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual code constructs observed. No evidence of obfuscated or malicious code sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server, uses standard libraries, and handles input in expected ways. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected. The structure and syntax are consistent with typical server scripts. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors are evident. Absence of obfuscation, unusual imports, or hidden code paths. Based on the provided code, it appears benign and aligned with common server setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server configuration script without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not pose an apparent security threat based on the analysis of its content.",
