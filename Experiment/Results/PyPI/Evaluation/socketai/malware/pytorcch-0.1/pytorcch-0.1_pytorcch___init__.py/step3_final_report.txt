  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from standard input, environment variables, network sources, external files, server setup code, or missing code sections.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communication functions, data storage, environment variables, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input sources to potential sinks via data processing or network operations, possibly involving environment variables or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Missing or empty code sections, potential obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious absence of code, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Missing code sections are flagged as suspicious but lack evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2—are consistent with the benign assessments, considering the low likelihood of malicious activity. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code descriptions. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified, and the overall risk remains low. The absence of code in some reports warrants cautious monitoring but does not justify higher risk scores without further evidence.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code and assign appropriate scores. The benign nature of the code is supported by the descriptions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, though the missing code sections are noted as suspicious but not malicious. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears sound, with no immediate concerns.",
