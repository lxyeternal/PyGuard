  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code appears to check for administrator privileges, create a directory, download an executable from a specified URL, and then execute it, likely for administrative or malicious purposes.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input data comes from environment checks (os.getuid(), ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()) and an external URL via requests.get().\",\n  \"sinks\": \"The downloaded content is written directly to a file ('C://Kingston//server.exe') and then executed using os.startfile(), which can execute potentially malicious code.\",\n  \"flows\": \"The code checks for admin privileges, then constructs a path, downloads a file from a remote server, saves it locally, and executes it, forming a flow from environment check and URL request to remote file execution.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Unconditional download and execution of a remote executable from a suspicious URL, creation of a directory with a generic name, lack of error handling, and minimal validation of downloaded content are suspicious behaviors. The URL points to a raw GitHub resource, which is a common tactic to host malicious payloads.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code first checks for administrator privileges using platform-specific methods. It then constructs a directory path and creates a directory named 'Kingston' in C:\\. Next, it downloads an executable from a remote URL hosted on GitHub and saves it as 'server.exe' inside the created directory. Finally, it executes the downloaded file immediately. The absence of error handling and validation, combined with remote code execution, suggest potentially malicious intent. The code could be used to download and run malicious payloads without user consent, representing a security risk.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable without validation, indicating high potential for malicious activity. It could be part of a malware dropper or remote command execution tool.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.8,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.8\n}",
