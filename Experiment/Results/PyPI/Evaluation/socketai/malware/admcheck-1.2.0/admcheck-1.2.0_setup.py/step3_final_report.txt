{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'admcheck' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies ('requests', 'pyautogui'), and classifiers within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or obfuscation are present. Dependencies are common benign packages. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
