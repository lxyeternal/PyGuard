{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'admcheck' that checks if a user has admin privileges.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package metadata (name, version, author info), dependencies ('requests' and 'pyautogui'), and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this setup script that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input. The script only configures package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata to invoking setup() with configuration parameters. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It defines static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers without any input/output handling, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. All dependencies are common and benign, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code injection. The script simply prepares the package configuration for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script for 'admcheck'.",
