  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'admcheck' that checks if a user has admin privileges.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package metadata variables, find_packages() function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, no network or system calls present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; only standard setup script with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution. It imports setuptools, defines version and description, and calls setup() with standard parameters. The dependencies 'requests' and 'pyautogui' are common and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling in this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears legitimate and straightforward.",
