  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'admcheck' intended to verify if a user has admin privileges.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of input or data; primarily static configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in this script; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly performs package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies ('requests', 'pyautogui'), and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or unusual code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies, aligning with normal Python packaging practices.",
