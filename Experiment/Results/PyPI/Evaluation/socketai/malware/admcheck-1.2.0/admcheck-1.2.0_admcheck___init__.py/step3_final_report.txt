  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the module 'admcheck.main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'admcheck.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import does not execute code or cause side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported content; no malicious code detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no execution or data manipulation. The use of 'import *' is a coding style concern but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage is present. The module 'admcheck.main' could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting the benign nature of this code. The security risk score is low, given the lack of active behavior. Confidence is high that this code is safe in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
