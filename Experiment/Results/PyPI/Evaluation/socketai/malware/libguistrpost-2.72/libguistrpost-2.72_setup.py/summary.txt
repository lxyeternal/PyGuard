  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent error handling, and embedded URL support the assessment of a significant security threat. All reports correctly identify these issues and assign high risk scores. It is prudent to treat this package as malicious until further decoding and verification of the payload are performed."
