{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious activity during package setup by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command when 'tahg' does not exist, indicating potential supply chain sabotage.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command; external URL in comments",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess; potential network connection to 'www.esquelesquad.rip'",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess execution; encoded command runs silently, possibly connecting to external malicious server",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent exception handling; external suspicious URL; conditional execution based on filesystem state",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command, referencing a suspicious URL. The command is obfuscated to hide malicious intent. Silent exception handling masks errors, increasing stealth. The setup() function appears benign, but the subprocess call indicates malicious activity. The external URL and obfuscation strongly suggest remote code execution or data exfiltration. Scores of malware (0.85), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified given these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains high-confidence malicious behavior through obfuscated remote PowerShell execution during installation, representing a serious supply chain security threat. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
