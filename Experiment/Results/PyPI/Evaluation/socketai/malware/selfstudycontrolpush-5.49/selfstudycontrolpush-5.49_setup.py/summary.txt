  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package import, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The behavior aligns with common malware techniques such as stealth, obfuscation, and covert execution. The current scores are appropriate, and further payload analysis is recommended to confirm malicious activity."
