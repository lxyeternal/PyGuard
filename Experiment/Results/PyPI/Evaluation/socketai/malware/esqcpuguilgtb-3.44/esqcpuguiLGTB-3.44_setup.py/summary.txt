  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command during package setup, coupled with a suspicious URL and error suppression. It should be flagged as malicious or highly suspicious, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its behavior."
