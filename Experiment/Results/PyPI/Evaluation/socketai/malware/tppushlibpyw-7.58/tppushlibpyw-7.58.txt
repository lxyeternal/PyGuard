      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, conditional execution, and hidden nature warrant treating this as malicious or compromised until further analysis (e.g., decoding the command) confirms the payload. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the behavior aligns with known supply chain attack tactics."
