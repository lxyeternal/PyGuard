  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a simple function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "The function call `ina()` which triggers the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Function invocation leads directly to outputting a fixed string; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function `ina()` that prints a static message. It then immediately calls this function. There are no external inputs, no use of environment variables, no network communication, and no data processing. The code is extremely simple, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic print operation with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a trivial, benign script.",
