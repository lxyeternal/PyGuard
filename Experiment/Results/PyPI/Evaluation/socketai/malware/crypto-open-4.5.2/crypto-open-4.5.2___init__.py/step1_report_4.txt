{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function 'ina' that prints a message indicating installation and then calls this function.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print statement, which is a benign operation.",
  "flows": "The function 'ina' is invoked immediately after its definition, leading to a straightforward call and output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is very minimal, consisting solely of a function definition and its invocation. It does not read external data, perform any network activity, access environment variables, or contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The print statement simply outputs a message indicating 'installed'. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flow, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and simple code snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a basic placeholder or notification function.",
