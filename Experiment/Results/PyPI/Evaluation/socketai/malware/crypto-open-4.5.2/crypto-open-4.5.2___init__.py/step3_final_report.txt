  "purpose": "A simple Python script defining and invoking a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "The function 'ina()' reads no external input; it is a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: function definition -> function call -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign script with no external dependencies, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. There are no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, harmless script with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current assessment and scores are justified and accurate.",
