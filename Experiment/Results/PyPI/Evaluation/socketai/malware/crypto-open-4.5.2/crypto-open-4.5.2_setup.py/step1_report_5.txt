{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', making HTTP GET requests to external URLs, reading files from the internet, executing downloaded files via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes a downloaded file, requests to external URLs that may be used for data exfiltration or command and control.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> constructed URL in 'send()' -> HTTP GET request; requests.get() -> saving file -> os.system('start ...') to execute downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional try-except block suppressing all exceptions, downloading and executing an executable during install, use of hardcoded URL and filename, dynamic code execution via os.system without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and sends it via an HTTP request to a suspicious domain. It then downloads an executable file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it without validation or user consent. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs payloads during installation. The try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures or malicious activity. The overall pattern suggests malicious intent, likely to infect the system or perform unauthorized actions during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by fetching and executing an external payload during package installation, potentially compromising the host system. The use of external network requests, silent execution, and hidden malicious activity strongly indicate malicious intent.",
