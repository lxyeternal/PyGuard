{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system environment information, downloads a remote executable, and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; downloads files from suspicious domains.",
  "sinks": "Executes downloaded files via os.system; network requests sending data externally.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable) -> HTTP request (data exfiltration); Downloaded file -> os.system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masking errors; downloading and executing external payloads without validation; hardcoded URLs; running code during package install.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment info, exfiltrates it via HTTP GET, downloads a remote executable, and executes it silently. The use of broad exception handling and external payloads indicates malicious behavior. The straightforward code structure confirms no obfuscation. The actions performed are typical of malware designed for remote control, data theft, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious activity involving data exfiltration and remote payload execution. It should be classified as high severity malware with a malware score of 1.0, no obfuscation (0), and a security risk score of 1.0.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
