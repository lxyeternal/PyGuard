{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'crypto-open' with an additional custom post-installation action that executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', downloading content from 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', fetching and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded file with os.system, making HTTP requests with 'requests.get'.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends data to external URL -> downloads and executes remote executable file.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching a script from a suspicious domain and executing it directly on install, usage of broad exception handling without logging, use of 'os.system' to run potentially malicious executable, potential for remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. It then downloads an executable file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the install process to call 'send' during installation. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and run potentially malicious code during package installation. The use of broad exception handling without logging or error reporting further obscures malicious activity, making detection difficult. The package's setup configuration does not reveal legitimate functionality, and the code actively contacts external servers to download and run an executable, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data and executing remote payloads during installation. It is highly likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote control, data theft, or system compromise. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
