  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-installation action.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetches data from an external URL, downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) executes downloaded file, requests.get() fetches external data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> requests.get() with URL containing env variable -> downloads executable -> os.system() runs the executable.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except without handling exceptions; downloads and executes an external executable from an untrusted URL; the URL and filename suggest malicious intent; environment variable usage to collect system info.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to gather the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious domain with this info. Subsequently, it downloads an executable file from a dubious URL and executes it, which indicates potential malware behavior. The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding failures that could reveal malicious activity. The package setup itself appears normal but the post-install behavior is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, primarily due to downloading and executing an external executable from an untrusted source and collecting system info. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, constituting a security threat.",
