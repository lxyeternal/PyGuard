{
  "purpose": "This code implements a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies, handling negotiation, authentication, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Network socket operations during proxy negotiation, credential handling, and connection establishment.",
  "sinks": "Data flows during proxy negotiation, credential transmission, and socket communication; no untrusted data leaks or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (proxy parameters, credentials) flow into negotiation functions; negotiation responses and socket connections are established; data flows through socket methods during communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments; the code follows standard patterns without anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client supporting multiple protocols. It performs proper protocol negotiation, handles credentials securely, and manages socket connections with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The data flows are typical for such a library, and the code does not contain any suspicious network activity or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a SOCKS proxy client with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and protocols, with no signs of sabotage or backdoors.",
