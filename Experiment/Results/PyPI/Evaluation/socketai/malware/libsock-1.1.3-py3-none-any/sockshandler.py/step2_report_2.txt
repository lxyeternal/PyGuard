  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a SOCKS proxy handler for urllib2 supporting HTTP and HTTPS.\n- It handles SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with support for remote DNS resolution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.\n- The code's purpose is legitimate: enabling routing of requests through a SOCKS proxy.\n- The network interactions are standard, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy tunneling via SOCKS5 for anonymization.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate proxy client.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy handler supporting SOCKS4/5, standard implementation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no secrets, standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Routing through SOCKS proxy, no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard proxy code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy handler for tunneling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical implementation, no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy for tunneling, standard setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1–0.2, reflecting a low but non-zero security risk due to network exposure, which is acceptable given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Code review confirms no malicious, obfuscated, or secretive behavior.**\n- **Scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.**\n- **Potential risks are minimal and related to network exposure, not malicious intent.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to network exposure, but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments necessary.",
