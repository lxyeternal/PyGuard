  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious behavior indicative of potential malware, specifically the covert execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during installation. The high obfuscation and silent execution increase the likelihood of malicious payloads. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command are recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious."
