{
  "purpose": "Detects execution of an obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command during package setup, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to conceal payloads.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing the encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers execution of encoded command; command runs silently in background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent error handling, execution during setup, no transparency about command content.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, which is suspicious. The command is base64-encoded, obscuring its purpose, and runs silently with no error reporting. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aiming to conceal payloads or backdoors. Multiple reports correctly identify this pattern, assigning high suspicion scores. The consistent use of obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional triggers strongly suggest malicious intent. Scores of malware at approximately 0.8, obfuscation at 0.85, and risk at 0.8 are justified based on these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious behavior indicative of potential malware, specifically the covert execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during installation. The high obfuscation and silent execution increase the likelihood of malicious payloads. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command are recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
