      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's characteristics. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 1 improves the assessment's precision, considering the obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments for better alignment."
