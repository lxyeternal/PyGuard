  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of potential malicious intent. While not definitively malicious without decoding the payload, the behavior warrants high suspicion and further analysis. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until the encoded command is decoded and verified."
