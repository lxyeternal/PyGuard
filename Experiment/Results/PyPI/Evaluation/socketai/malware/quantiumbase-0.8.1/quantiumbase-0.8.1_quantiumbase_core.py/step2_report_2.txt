  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a database abstraction layer supporting multiple backends, with connection and transaction management, and safe query building.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Use of dynamic import for backends is standard. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low). These seem reasonable given the description.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk score is justified, and malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe URL parsing, connection handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity. Uses standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Slightly lower risk, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard async database layer with connection pooling, URL parsing, and safe query handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of injection, secrets, or malicious code. Proper parameter binding, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on connection management, URL parsing, and transaction safety.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is consistent; the low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing secure connection and query handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Matches the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no obfuscated or confusing code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting the low but non-zero potential for misconfiguration or misuse. This is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly related to URL handling and dynamic imports, which are standard but could be misused if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Value |\n|--------------|------------------|\n| Malware      | 0                |\n| Obfuscated   | 0                |\n| Risk         | 0.1              |\n\nThis code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated patterns.",
