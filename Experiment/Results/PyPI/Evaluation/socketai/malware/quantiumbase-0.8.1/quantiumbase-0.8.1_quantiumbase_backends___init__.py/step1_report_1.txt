  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code, this is uncertain.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading input from user input, environment variables, files, network calls, or third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writes, subprocess calls, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through various functions or data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without the code, but watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed step-by-step analysis due to lack of code. The general process would involve identifying data sources, tracing data flows, and inspecting sinks for untrusted data handling. Without the code, specific vulnerabilities cannot be pinpointed.",
