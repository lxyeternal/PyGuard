  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent with the evidence, indicating no malicious activity or security risks in the analyzed dependencies. Given the absence of code snippets and suspicious features, the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and security risk scores can be further lowered to 0 or 0.1 for maximal accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears benign, and no further action is necessary."
