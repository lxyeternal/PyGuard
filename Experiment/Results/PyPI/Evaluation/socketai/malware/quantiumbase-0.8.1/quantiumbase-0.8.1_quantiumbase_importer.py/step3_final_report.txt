  "purpose": "Utility for dynamically importing a module and retrieving a nested attribute specified by a string in the format '<module>:<attribute>'.",
  "sources": "The input string 'import_str' which is parsed into module and attribute parts.",
  "sinks": "The importlib.import_module call and getattr calls which access modules and attributes based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Parsing 'import_str' -> importing module via importlib.import_module -> accessing nested attributes via getattr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns; standard use of Python import mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dynamic import operations with proper error handling. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. Potential security concern arises if 'import_str' is untrusted, leading to possible import of malicious modules or unintended attribute access. However, the code itself is benign and uses well-known Python features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for dynamic imports with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is misuse with untrusted input, which is inherent to such functions. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
