  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and embeds a payload involving network requests, suggesting malicious intent. It appears designed to generate and store malicious scripts for later execution or exfiltration. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed here, the pattern and techniques used are characteristic of malware loaders or backdoors. Therefore, it warrants a high malware score and security risk assessment."
