{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports specific classes from a package and defines module metadata, likely to set up a Python package or module for data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'quantiumbase.core' and local 'backends' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a third-party package and a local module, then defines versioning and export variables. It is straightforward and contains no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No data handling, input/output, or network operations are present that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears benign, serving as a module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
