  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe identical or very similar code snippets: simple import statements, versioning, and export definitions.\n- No dynamic code, no data flows, no user input, no external data sources, no network activity, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0 or very low.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original snippet provided.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No mistakes are apparent in the reasoning. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk score is 0, as the code is a standard module setup with no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code's benign nature.\n- No report overstates or understates the risk; the scores are appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Given the uniformity and clarity, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, standard module setup with no suspicious activity, no data leaks, no dynamic code, and no external threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No further action needed.",
