  "purpose": "Import core classes from quantiumbase and a local module for data processing",
  "sources": "Import statements from quantiumbase.core and local .backends module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Imports suggest setup for database operations and backend processing; no data flows are evident within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns; imports are standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from an external package and a local module, sets a version string and an __all__ list. There are no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious code indicators. The imports are standard for a module setup, and the versioning is typical. No external data sources, no data sinks, and no evident data flow paths involving untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger package setup and contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
