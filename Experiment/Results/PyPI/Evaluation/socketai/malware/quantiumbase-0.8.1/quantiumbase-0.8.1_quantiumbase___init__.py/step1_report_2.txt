{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up module exports for a package related to quantiumbase, likely involving database interactions and data processing backends.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'quantiumbase.core' and relative import of 'dataflow' from '.backends'. No direct user input or external data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or eval-like functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward, involving only imports and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and modules, then defines version and export variables. No functions, data processing, or external data handling are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are visible. It is a typical module setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initialization and export setup with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is unlikely to pose any security risks.",
