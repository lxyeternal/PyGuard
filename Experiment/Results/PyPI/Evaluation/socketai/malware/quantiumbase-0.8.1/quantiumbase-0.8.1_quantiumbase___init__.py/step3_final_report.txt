  "purpose": "Module initialization and export setup for the package, importing core classes and defining version and export variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'quantiumbase.core' and local '.backends' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from external modules to local namespace; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup: importing core classes, defining version info, and setting __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, no data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or security issues are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
