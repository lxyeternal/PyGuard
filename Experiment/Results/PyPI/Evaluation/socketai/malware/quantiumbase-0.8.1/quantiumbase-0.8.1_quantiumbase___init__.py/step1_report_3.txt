  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from a package and defines module metadata, likely part of a larger Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'quantiumbase.core' and local 'backends' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "Imported classes could be used elsewhere in the package; no data flow shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed in this minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and sets module version and export variables. It does not contain any data handling, network activity, or malicious logic. The import paths appear legitimate, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization segment with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
