{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export core database classes and version information for a Python package, facilitating database interactions and backend integrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from quantiumbase.core import Database, DatabaseURL' and 'from .backends import dataflow'",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing, network communication, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed; the code is straightforward module setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a core module and a local backend module, then sets version info and __all__ for export. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. No evidence of data leakage, credential handling, or network activity. It functions as a typical module initialization segment, exposing core components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It merely manages imports and exports with no evident security issues.",
