{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for packaging a Python project called 'quantiumbase', including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for version info, reading README.md for long description, walking directories for packages.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external system effects are visible.",
  "flows": "Reading package files -> setting package version and description -> configuring dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution or external calls beyond standard setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup.py practices for Python packaging. It reads the version from the package's __init__.py, loads README content, discovers packages, and specifies dependencies and metadata. No code injection, external data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, adhering to common packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It securely handles local file reads and package configuration.",
