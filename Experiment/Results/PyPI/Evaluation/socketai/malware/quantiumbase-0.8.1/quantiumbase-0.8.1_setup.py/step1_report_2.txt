{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'quantiumbase' that reads package information and dependencies to facilitate installation.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py for version info; reading README.md for long description; os.walk for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution; all file reads and package metadata are static.",
  "flows": "Reading version and description files, walking directory tree to identify packages, then passing data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; code follows standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (__init__.py, README.md), performs directory traversal for packages, and passes data to setuptools.setup(). There are no user inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. Dependencies are specified explicitly. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code present. The logic is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is used solely for package configuration and distribution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
