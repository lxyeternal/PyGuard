{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'quantiumbase', specifying dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading `__init__.py` for version info, reading 'README.md' for long description, walking directories to find packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink functions or untrusted data handling points; all file reads and package data are static or controlled.",
  "flows": "File reads (version and description) to setup configuration; directory traversal to identify packages; static dependency specification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that defines functions to extract version info, read long description, and gather packages for distribution. It uses file reading and directory traversal with no external inputs or untrusted data sources. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are clearly specified with version constraints. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration.",
