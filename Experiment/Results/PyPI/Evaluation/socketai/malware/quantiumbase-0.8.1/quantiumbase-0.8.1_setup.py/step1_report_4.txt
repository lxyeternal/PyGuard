{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'quantiumbase' Python package, managing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py to get version, reading README.md for long description, os.walk for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to potential data leaks or security-sensitive operations; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "File reading operations feed data into setup parameters; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs observed. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package version info from a __init__.py file, and the README.md for description. It dynamically finds sub-packages via os.walk, then calls setuptools.setup with package info, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for a package setup. No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious behavior. Dependencies are standard and explicitly specified. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It properly manages dependencies and package metadata without any harmful operations.",
