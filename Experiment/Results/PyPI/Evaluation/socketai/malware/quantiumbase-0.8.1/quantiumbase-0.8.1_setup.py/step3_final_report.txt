{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging the 'quantiumbase' Python project, handling version extraction, long description reading, package discovery, and dependency specification.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, reads README.md, walks directories to find packages, and specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and directory traversal to gather package info; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with static, controlled file reads and directory walks. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external inputs are involved. Dependency constraints are explicit and safe. The code adheres to standard practices and contains no obfuscation or malicious code. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
