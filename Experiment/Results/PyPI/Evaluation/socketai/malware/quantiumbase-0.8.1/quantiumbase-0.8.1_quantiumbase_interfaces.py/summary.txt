  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions for asynchronous database operations, with no embedded malware or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its abstract nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.05). It poses no security threat and is safe for use as a structural component."
