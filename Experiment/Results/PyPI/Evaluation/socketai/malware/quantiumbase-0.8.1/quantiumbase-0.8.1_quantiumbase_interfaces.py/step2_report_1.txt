  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of abstract classes and method signatures.\n- No implementation details, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code is standard for defining database interface layers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code defines interfaces for async database operations with no executable logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the abstract nature and lack of implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is purely abstract, with no concrete logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Highlights the absence of data processing or external communication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others—interface definitions without executable logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's abstract nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of implementation, no active malicious behavior, and the standard interface pattern, a low risk score (around 0.1) is justified. Slight variation exists, but overall, the scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to potential misuse if subclasses mishandle untrusted data, but the interface itself is benign)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary. The code appears to be a benign, standard set of interface definitions for asynchronous database operations, with no embedded malware or suspicious behavior.",
