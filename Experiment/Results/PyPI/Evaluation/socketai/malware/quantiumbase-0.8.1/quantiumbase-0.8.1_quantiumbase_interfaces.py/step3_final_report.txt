{
  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for asynchronous database operations, including connection, transaction, and record handling, without concrete implementation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'query' of type ClauseElement, and properties like 'raw_connection'.",
  "sinks": "Methods like 'fetch_one', 'execute', 'execute_many', 'iterate', which could process untrusted data if subclass implementations mishandle inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (queries) to outputs (records, values), but as this is an interface, no actual data flow occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for defining async database interface classes with placeholder methods.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract class definitions with method signatures and no executable logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, embedded code, or suspicious patterns. The 'yield True' in 'iterate' is a placeholder to satisfy type checkers. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code serves as a blueprint for database backends, and its structure indicates a benign purpose. Given the absence of implementation, data handling, or embedded code, the potential for malicious activity is negligible. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions for asynchronous database operations, with no embedded malware or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its abstract nature, warranting a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.05). It poses no security threat and is safe for use as a structural component.",
