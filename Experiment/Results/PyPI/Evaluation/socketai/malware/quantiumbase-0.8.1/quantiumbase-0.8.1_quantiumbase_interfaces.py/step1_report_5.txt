{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for database connection, transaction, and record handling with no direct implementation or operational code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code contains only class definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code is purely interface definitions without logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only abstract method signatures with no concrete implementation, no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract classes for database interaction, including connection management, querying, transaction handling, and record abstraction. It lacks executable logic, data handling, or external communication that could be exploited. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious operations. The design appears to be a standard interface blueprint for database backends, with no code that could be malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface definitions with no executable or malicious content. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious blueprint for database backend interactions, with no security risks identified.",
