  "conclusion": "The script contains high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The high obfuscation and execution pattern justify a high malware and risk score. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants treating this package as potentially malicious."
