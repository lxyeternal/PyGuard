  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'Hola' with no external dependencies or inputs.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from any source.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code executes a static print statement with no data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial print statement with no inputs, external dependencies, or data flows. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The analysis confirms the code is harmless, and the scores are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores correctly reflect the code's trivial and safe nature.",
