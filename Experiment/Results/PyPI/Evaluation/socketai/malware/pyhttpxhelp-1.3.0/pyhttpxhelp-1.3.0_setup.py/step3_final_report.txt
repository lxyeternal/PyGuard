  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version, description, long description, and package list; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder descriptions ('e') are unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic execution, input handling, or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The placeholder descriptions are atypical but not problematic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with placeholder metadata. All reports are accurate; no modifications needed. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
