  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyhttpxhelp'.",
  "sources": "Constants defined at the beginning (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and the setup() function which uses these constants.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function that registers package metadata, which is unlikely to be a sink for malicious data.",
  "flows": "Constants are used directly in setup() to specify package info; no untrusted data sources or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, standard setup script without suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for packaging, defines basic metadata variables, and calls setup() with static information. There are no inputs, data flows, or external code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The script appears to be a minimal, standard package setup file, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines package metadata and invokes setuptools to prepare the package for distribution.",
