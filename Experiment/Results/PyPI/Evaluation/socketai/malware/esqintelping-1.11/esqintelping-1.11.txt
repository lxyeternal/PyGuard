      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with embedded malicious indicators. The high scores reflect significant security concern. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions, but current evidence warrants treating this as a high-risk, potentially malicious package."
