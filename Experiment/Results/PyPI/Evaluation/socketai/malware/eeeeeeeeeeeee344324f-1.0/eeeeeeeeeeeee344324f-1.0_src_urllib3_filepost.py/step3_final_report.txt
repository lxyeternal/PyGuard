  "purpose": "Generate multipart/form-data payloads for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input fields provided as dicts, lists, or RequestField objects; boundary generated via os.urandom and binascii.hexlify.",
  "sinks": "Rendering headers with RequestField.render_headers(); writing data to BytesIO stream.",
  "flows": "Fields are iterated over, headers rendered, data written into BytesIO, boundary appended, and final payload returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard use of secure random source.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard multipart encoding, using secure boundary generation with os.urandom, handling various input formats, and rendering headers via a method presumed to be secure. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's straightforward, standard implementation. Reliance on RequestField.render_headers() is typical; unless that method is malicious, the overall security posture remains safe. The low risk score reflects the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The high confidence score (around 0.9) is justified by the code's clarity and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for multipart/form-data encoding, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
