  "purpose": "This code module provides functions for generating multipart/form-data payloads, including boundary generation and iteration over form fields for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reads include os.urandom for boundary generation, input fields (dicts or lists), and data within RequestField objects.",
  "sinks": "Data is written into a BytesIO object, and headers are rendered from RequestField objects. The boundary string is used in Content-Type header.",
  "flows": "Boundary generated from os.urandom -> used in headers and body construction; fields and their data flow into the multipart body.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of os.urandom for boundary is standard; no suspicious data leaks or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for multipart form-data encoding. It uses standard modules and functions to generate a boundary, iterate over fields, and assemble data. Boundary generation via os.urandom is typical and safe. The code handles different data types appropriately. No malicious code or behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Functions like 'choose_boundary' use secure random sources. No external untrusted inputs are processed without sanitization, but since the data is used for form encoding, this is standard practice. Overall, the implementation appears clean and secure, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for multipart/form-data encoding, with no malicious behavior detected. It correctly generates boundaries, iterates over form fields, and constructs request bodies. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns or data leaks.",
