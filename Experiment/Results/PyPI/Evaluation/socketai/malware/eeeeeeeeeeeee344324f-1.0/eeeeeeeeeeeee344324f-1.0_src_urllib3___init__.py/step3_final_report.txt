  "purpose": "Initialization and configuration of an HTTP client library, managing logging, warnings, and optional deprecated imports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, warning filters, and functions that set up logging and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; primarily configuration and setup code.",
  "flows": "Import and setup functions execute without processing untrusted input; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecated optional import ('urllib3_secure_extra') that triggers a warning; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard library initialization module, managing logging handlers, warning filters, and optional imports. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation are present. The deprecation warning about 'urllib3[secure]' is benign and indicates ongoing maintenance. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code, with the slight risk due to deprecation warnings being a maintenance concern rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The minimal security risk is primarily due to maintenance warnings, which do not pose an immediate threat. The supply chain security posture for this code is considered safe.",
