{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a malicious stealer and backdoor, aiming to extract sensitive user data such as browser credentials, cookies, system information, Discord tokens, crypto wallets, and other personal files, then exfiltrate this data via various methods including uploads and messaging platforms. It also includes persistence mechanisms, UAC bypass, process manipulation, and anti-analysis features.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system directories (browser data, system info, clipboard, files), environment variables, registry queries, and network requests. It also captures data from browser files, system commands, and user interactions (webcam, clipboard).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include writing stolen data to temporary files, creating archives, uploading files to external servers (gofile, anonfiles), sending messages via Telegram API, and injecting code into Discord applications. It also executes system commands and manipulates processes, which could lead to code execution or system disruption.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser data, system info, clipboard, and network responses flow into local storage (files, variables), then into archives or directly to upload endpoints. Data from browser files, system commands, and network requests flow into exfiltration points like uploads or messaging platforms. The code also manipulates processes and injects code into Discord, creating source-to-sink paths for persistence and backdoor functionalities.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated strings (base64-encoded commands), hardcoded C2 server URLs, base64-encoded malware commands, and suspicious system manipulations (UAC bypass, process kill, registry edits). It performs stealth operations like hiding files, disabling Defender, and self-deletion. The presence of malicious backdoor injection code into Discord files and the use of encoded PowerShell commands are notable anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive malware designed for data theft, persistence, and system sabotage. It uses obfuscation (base64 encoding, string manipulations) to hide malicious commands. It accesses sensitive user data (browsers, wallets, system info), exfiltrates via uploads or messaging, and employs system manipulation techniques (UAC bypass, process kill, hiding files). It also injects malicious code into Discord applications for backdoor access. The code includes self-deletion and anti-VM checks, indicating an intent to evade detection. The malware scores high on malicious intent and security risk due to its extensive data collection, stealth, and system compromise capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, functioning as a data stealer, backdoor, and system manipulator. It exhibits advanced obfuscation, persistence, and exfiltration techniques, confirming high malicious intent and security risk. The malware is designed to operate covertly, steal sensitive data, and maintain persistence on infected systems.",
