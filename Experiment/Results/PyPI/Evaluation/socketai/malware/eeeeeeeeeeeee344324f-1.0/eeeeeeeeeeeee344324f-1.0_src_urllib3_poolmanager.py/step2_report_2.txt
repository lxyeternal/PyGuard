  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes connection pooling and proxy support; sources are URL inputs, headers, and configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input flows into URL parsing, pool creation, and request execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, well-structured, and lacks malicious behavior. Proxy handling is explicit and validated.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar connection and proxy management; inputs include URLs, headers, configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through URL parsing, pool creation, and request handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard patterns, no malicious intent, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators; code is typical for an HTTP client library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Connection pooling with proxy support; inputs are URLs, headers, configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar flow—URL parsing, pool management, request execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate, standard code, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Connection pooling, proxy support; inputs are URLs, headers, configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar flow, from input to network request.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, typical HTTP client code, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Connection and proxy management; inputs are URLs, headers, configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input flows into connection pools and network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports are about the same code base, which is a well-structured HTTP/HTTPS connection pool and proxy management library.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal, related to standard proxy handling, which is explicitly configurable.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and low security risk, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and no malicious signs, a **low risk score (~0.1 to 0.2)** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate HTTP client utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment.",
