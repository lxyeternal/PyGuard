  "purpose": "Define a mixin class for making HTTP requests with flexible encoding options, intended for classes implementing urlopen.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data sources are present in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data is sent to external sinks or network connections within this code).",
  "flows": "The code constructs request URLs and bodies but does not perform actual network communication; it delegates to the urlopen method implemented elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to format HTTP request data correctly, choosing between URL-encoded or multipart forms. It relies on an external urlopen method, which is not implemented here. All methods are standard and use common, well-understood libraries like urlencode and encode_multipart_formdata. No code injection, malicious data handling, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to be a typical request helper class without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe implementation of an HTTP request helper class. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It merely facilitates request construction and delegates actual network calls to an external method. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
