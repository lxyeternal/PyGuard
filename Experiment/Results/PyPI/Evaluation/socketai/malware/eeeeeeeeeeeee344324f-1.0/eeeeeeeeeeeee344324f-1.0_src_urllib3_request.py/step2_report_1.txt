  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a standard HTTP request helper with no malicious behavior. It highlights the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the slight security risk score accounts for potential misuse if extended improperly, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds the code to be a typical request utility with no malicious intent. It notes the potential for misuse if untrusted input is supplied but emphasizes the code's standard nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** The zero malware and obfuscated scores are justified; the security risk is minimal given the code's purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is deemed a standard HTTP helper class with no malicious behavior. It recognizes the potential for misuse with untrusted data but considers this inherent to such libraries.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** Consistent with prior assessments; the risk score reflects typical concerns about untrusted input, not malicious code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is identified as a typical, safe request helper class with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** Appropriate, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with previous reports, confirming the code's standard, non-malicious nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior—no code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. **I agree with a malware score of 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear and straightforward. **Obfuscated=0 is appropriate.**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** The highest assigned is 0.2, reflecting potential misuse if untrusted input is handled improperly. Given the code's purpose as a request helper, this is reasonable. **However, the code itself does not introduce security vulnerabilities; the risk is more about how it's used.** I would suggest maintaining the 0.2 score, as it reflects the inherent risk in handling untrusted data, not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured helper class for HTTP requests.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The potential security risk is minimal and related to user input handling, which is typical for such libraries.\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, reflecting the typical risk associated with untrusted input handling)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard in design. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
