  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP request helper class, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a typical request helper class, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative but acceptable given that untrusted input (fields, headers, URL) can be misused if subclasses do not implement proper validation. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe confidence is high, and the code appears benign. The security risk is minimal, and no malicious indicators are present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard HTTP request utility with no malicious behavior. Potential misuse if untrusted input is supplied, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scores reflect the benign nature of the code. The security risk score considers potential misuse but recognizes that this is common in such libraries.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing standard design, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate assessment. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical HTTP request helper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, score=0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly conservative at 0.2 in some reports, which is acceptable considering potential misuse if inputs are not validated, but overall the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, mainly due to potential misuse if inputs are not sanitized, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured HTTP request helper class, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
