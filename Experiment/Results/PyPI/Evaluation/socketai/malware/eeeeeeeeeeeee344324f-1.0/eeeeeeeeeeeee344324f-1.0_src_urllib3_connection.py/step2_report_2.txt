  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency, and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard HTTP/HTTPS connection classes with SSL, proxy, and connection management.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Reads include user input (headers, URLs, proxies). Sinks are network sockets, SSL wrap socket, headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code handles SSL contexts, hostname verification, and connection setup properly. No signs of malicious activity. The SSL verification and hostname checks are standard and secure.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malware, minimal risk.\n\n**Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, with SSL/TLS, proxy, hostname verification.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Configuration parameters, environment variables, socket connections, SSL handshake.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Proper SSL context handling, hostname verification, and warnings for system time issues. No malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malware.\n\n**Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Connection classes with SSL, proxy, hostname verification.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Input parameters, environment variables, socket connections, SSL wrapping.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SSL setup, hostname validation, exception handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malware.\n\n**Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Connection setup with SSL, hostname verification, proxy.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Hostnames, SSL contexts, socket connections, data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard warnings.\n- **Analysis:** Implements standard secure connection procedures, proper SSL context management, hostname verification, and warnings for system time issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malware.\n\n**Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Secure connection classes with SSL, proxy, hostname verification.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Hostnames, headers, SSL contexts, socket operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Proper SSL verification, hostname validation, and connection management. No malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malware.\n\n**Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns—no backdoors, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is standard for a secure HTTP client library.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python modules and practices.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, given the code's purpose.\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented part of a secure HTTP client library, with no signs of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**            | **0.1–0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the purpose of the code.",
