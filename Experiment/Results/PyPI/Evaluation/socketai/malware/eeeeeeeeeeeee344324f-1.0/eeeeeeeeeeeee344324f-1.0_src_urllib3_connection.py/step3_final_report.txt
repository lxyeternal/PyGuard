{
  "purpose": "Provides custom HTTP and HTTPS connection classes with SSL/TLS support, proxy configuration, and connection management, ensuring secure communication with servers.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters (host, port, SSL options, proxy settings), environment variables, and network socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, SSL wrap functions, headers, and request data transmission.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs flow into connection setup, SSL context creation, hostname verification, and socket connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows or backdoors detected. Warnings about system time are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-structured classes for HTTP/HTTPS connections with proper SSL context handling, hostname verification, and proxy support. It manages SSL certificates, verifies hostnames, and handles exceptions appropriately. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The security practices align with industry standards, and the code does not contain any signs of supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of HTTP/HTTPS connection classes. It exhibits no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given its functionality and adherence to security best practices.",
