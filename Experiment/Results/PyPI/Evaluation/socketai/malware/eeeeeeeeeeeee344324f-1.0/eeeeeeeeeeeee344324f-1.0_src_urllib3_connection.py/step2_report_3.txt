  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's logic, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides custom HTTP/HTTPS classes with SSL/TLS, proxy, and connection management. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. It emphasizes proper SSL verification, hostname checks, and security features.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of connection classes with security features. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack behavior. The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate, given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on SSL/TLS, hostname verification, proxy support, and connection management. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with standard practices. The risk score is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard connection handling, SSL verification, proxy configuration, and hostname validation. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical of secure network modules. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SSL security, hostname verification, proxy support, and proper exception handling. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score reflects the absence of any suspicious behavior. The code is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on SSL, proxy, hostname validation, and secure request handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with secure connection modules. The risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's functionality. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the code's role as a standard, security-focused network connection class.\n\n- **Logic and Reasoning:** The reports correctly identify the code as standard, secure, and free of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent with analysis)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of any suspicious patterns, a risk score of **0.1** seems appropriate, slightly lower than the highest reported 0.2, reflecting minimal residual concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code. It is a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of HTTP/HTTPS connection classes with no malicious intent or supply chain attack behavior.",
