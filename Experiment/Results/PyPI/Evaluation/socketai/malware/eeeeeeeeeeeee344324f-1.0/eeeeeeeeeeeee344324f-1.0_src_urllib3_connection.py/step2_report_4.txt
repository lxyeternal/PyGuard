  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency, and risk assessments step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code handles HTTP/HTTPS connections, SSL, proxy, and request management. Sources include user input (headers, URLs, proxy configs), environment variables, and network sockets. Sinks are network sockets, SSL wrap functions, and headers.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected. Standard SSL handling, hostname verification, and exception handling. The code manages SSL contexts properly, with warnings for system time issues, which are benign.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The reviewer concludes it's a legitimate, secure implementation with minimal risk. The confidence is high (0.9). No obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on connection setup, SSL, hostname verification, and proxy support. No suspicious data flows or sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or obfuscation. Proper SSL context management, warnings for system time, and standard practices. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, secure code. Risk and malware scores are 0.2 and 0, respectively, which are reasonable given the standard security features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, similar connection handling with SSL, proxy, hostname verification, and data flow management. No suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard SSL practices, and proper exception handling. No malicious behaviors or backdoors.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate and secure. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard secure connection setup, SSL verification, hostname validation, proxy support. No suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Warnings for system time issues are standard, not malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical, secure connection module. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar focus on secure connection, SSL, proxy, hostname verification, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or malicious code. Proper SSL context management, warnings, and request handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, security-conscious code. No malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Validity:** All reports correctly identify this code as a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP/HTTPS connection classes with SSL/TLS, proxy support, hostname verification, and request handling.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard security considerations like system time warnings and SSL verification, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minor security considerations (warnings, SSL defaults), but overall minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation of HTTP/HTTPS connection classes. The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
