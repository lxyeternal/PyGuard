  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility implementation for HTTP headers and cache management, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors. The minor fallback threading class does not introduce security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern."
