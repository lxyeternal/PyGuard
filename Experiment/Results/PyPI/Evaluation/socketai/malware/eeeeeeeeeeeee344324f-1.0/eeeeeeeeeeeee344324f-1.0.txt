      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, functioning as a data stealer, backdoor, and system manipulator. It exhibits advanced obfuscation, persistence, and exfiltration techniques, confirming high malicious intent and security risk. The malware is designed to operate covertly, steal sensitive data, and maintain persistence on infected systems."

The minor fallback threading class does not introduce security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern."
