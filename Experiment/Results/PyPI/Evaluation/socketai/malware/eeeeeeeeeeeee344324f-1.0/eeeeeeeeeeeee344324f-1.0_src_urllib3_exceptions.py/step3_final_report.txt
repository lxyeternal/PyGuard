{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling HTTP, SSL, connection pooling, timeout, and related errors in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and inheritance, no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "flows": "Error classes are instantiated during exception handling; no data flow or external input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for various error scenarios in an HTTP client context. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or other custom exceptions, with straightforward constructors. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or backdoors. The code is purely structural, serving as error containers or signals. The import statements are standard, and the class hierarchy is typical for such a module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for error handling. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
