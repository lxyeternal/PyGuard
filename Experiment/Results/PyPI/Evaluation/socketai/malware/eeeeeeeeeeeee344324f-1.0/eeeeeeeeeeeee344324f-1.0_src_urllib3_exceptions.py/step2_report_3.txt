  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, data flows, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes for HTTP and connection errors.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is purely class definitions for error handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes for network errors.  \n- **Analysis:** No external data processing or execution, just class declarations. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines exceptions for network, SSL, timeout, and pool errors.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard class hierarchy, no malicious behavior, no external data handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for HTTP errors, SSL, timeouts, etc.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for errors and warnings in an HTTP client.  \n- **Analysis:** Same as others—standard class definitions, no malicious activity, no data manipulation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a set of exception class definitions, typical for an HTTP client library.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected; no code performs malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoors.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present; code is straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Security risk:** None; the code is purely structural, used for error handling.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard, and secure. No adjustments are necessary based on the reports provided.",
