{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes used within an HTTP client library, primarily to handle various network, SSL, and request errors.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; it primarily declares exception classes. The only data input is the parameters passed during instantiation of exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are used to propagate errors, but do not contain code that directly executes untrusted data or performs harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Error conditions propagate through the creation and raising of exception objects, not through data flow or external inputs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The class inheritance and structure are standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a collection of exception class definitions for error handling in an HTTP client context. It uses standard Python features such as inheritance, initializers, and string formatting. No external data is processed, and no potentially malicious behavior is evident. The exception classes facilitate error reporting and handling but do not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or other risky actions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for network error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for use in an HTTP client library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It functions solely to define error types, and no part of the code actively performs network activity or data manipulation. Overall, it is benign and aligns with standard practices for exception handling in Python.",
