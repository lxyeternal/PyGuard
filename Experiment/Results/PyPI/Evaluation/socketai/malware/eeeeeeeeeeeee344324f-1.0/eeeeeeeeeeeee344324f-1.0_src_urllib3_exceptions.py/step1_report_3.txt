{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes used by an HTTP client library to handle various network and protocol errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and exception handling logic, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing operations where untrusted data could cause security issues, such as network connections, file operations, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily declares exception classes and their constructors without executing any logic involving external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is standard exception class definitions, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for various network errors, SSL issues, protocol problems, and warnings. These classes facilitate error handling in an HTTP client but do not execute any network operations or process untrusted input directly. The inheritance structure and constructors are straightforward and follow typical patterns. No suspicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors, are present. The code appears to be a standard part of an HTTP library for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for network and protocol error handling in an HTTP client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code activities. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
