  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and connection errors, warnings, and specific error conditions in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features and a specific class from the six.moves.http_client module.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are designed for error handling; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this is a definitions module for exceptions without executable data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code strictly defines exception classes and warnings without executing or manipulating data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of exception classes for HTTP errors, connection issues, SSL problems, warnings, and related error conditions. It uses inheritance appropriately and includes custom initialization for specific error cases. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. All classes serve to facilitate error handling in a larger HTTP client context. The import from six.moves.http_client and the extension of httplib.IncompleteRead are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines a structured hierarchy of exception and warning classes for an HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling module.",
