{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and connection-related errors in a Python HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features and a third-party module for HTTP client support.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; exception classes are data containers or error definitions.",
  "flows": "Exception raising and inheritance structures; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code primarily consists of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions or other custom exceptions, mainly for network, HTTP, and SSL error handling. No code execution, data processing, or untrusted input handling occurs within this snippet. The presence of exception classes is typical for robust error management in a library. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The only noteworthy aspect is comprehensive error classification, which appears legitimate and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for HTTP error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is purely structural and designed for error reporting within a larger HTTP client library.",
