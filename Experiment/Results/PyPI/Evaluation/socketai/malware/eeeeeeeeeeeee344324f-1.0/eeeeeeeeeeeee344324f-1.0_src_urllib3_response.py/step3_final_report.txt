  "purpose": "HTTP Response container handling decoding, transfer encoding, connection management, and response data reading.",
  "sources": "Network response via '_fp', headers, response status, and response body.",
  "sinks": "Decoded response data, connection objects, and response headers.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from network input through decoders (gzip, deflate, brotli) to read and stream methods, with error handling and connection management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTTP response handler with support for content decoding, chunked transfer encoding, and connection lifecycle management. It uses well-established libraries and practices for decoding compressed content, handles errors gracefully, and manages connection pooling. No malicious data flows, command execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The decoding classes and response methods follow typical patterns, and no obfuscation or suspicious logic is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP response handler with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It handles untrusted data appropriately, with robust error handling and connection management. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting standard decoding and response processing without malicious intent.",
