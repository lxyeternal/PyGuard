  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present.\n   - The comment about CODEOWNERS protection is informational and does not influence code execution or security.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The comments about CODEOWNERS do not imply any security issues or code anomalies; they are standard project management notes.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, as the code is straightforward)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (appropriate, no security concern)\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Therefore, no adjustments are necessary here.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the actual code content.\n   - The comments about CODEOWNERS are correctly interpreted as informational, not as indicators of malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward version declaration with an informational comment. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The comments about CODEOWNERS are standard project practices and do not imply any security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is entirely benign, with zero malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
