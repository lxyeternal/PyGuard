  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; the only source is the static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The comment about CODEOWNERS is a standard repository annotation, not an active security feature or anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string with a comment. It contains no input handling, data processing, network activity, or malicious constructs. The comment about CODEOWNERS is informational and does not affect security. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version indicator with a standard comment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
