{
  "purpose": "To perform a custom installation process that includes establishing a reverse shell connection.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to 104.248.19.57 on port 3333 during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The duplication of socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error and spawning a shell, which can give remote control over the system.",
  "flows": "During installation, socket connects to remote server -> socket file descriptors duplicated to stdin/out/err -> pty.spawn executes /bin/sh, allowing remote shell access.",
  "anomalies": "The code establishes an outbound connection to an external IP during installation and spawns a shell, which is unusual for standard setup scripts and indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the install command to include network activity where a socket connects to a specific IP address. It then redirects standard file descriptors to this socket and spawns a shell, effectively creating a backdoor. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code aimed at remote access. No legitimate use case is evident in this context. The code is concise but performs a highly suspicious action during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically creating a reverse shell during installation. This is a significant security threat and indicates the package is compromised or intentionally malicious.",
