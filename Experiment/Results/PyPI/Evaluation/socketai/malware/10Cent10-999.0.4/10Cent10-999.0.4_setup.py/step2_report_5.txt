  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and compare them to the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The setup script defines a custom install class (`CustomInstall`) that, during installation:\n  - Connects to a remote IP (`104.248.19.57`) on port `3333`.\n  - Redirects standard input/output/error to this socket.\n  - Spawns a shell (`/bin/sh`) via `pty.spawn`.\n- The code imports modules like `requests`, `getpass`, `socket`, `os`, `pty`.\n- The behavior is highly suspicious, indicating a potential backdoor or reverse shell.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the core malicious behavior: establishing an outbound socket connection, redirecting I/O, and spawning a shell during installation.  \n  **Confirmed:** The code exhibits malicious behavior as described.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurately describe the code's behavior. They note the unusual and suspicious nature of connecting to an external IP and spawning a shell during setup, which is not standard practice.  \n  **Confirmed:** No logical errors in the reports.\n\n- **Scores (malware, securityRisk, obfuscated):**  \n  All reports assign high malware scores (0.95 or 1), high security risk (0.9 or 1), and obfuscation is 0 (no obfuscation).  \n  These seem reasonable given the behavior.\n\n- **Justification for high risk/malware scores:**  \n  The code creates a reverse shell, which is a severe security threat, justifying scores of 1 or near 1.  \n  **Confirmed:** The scores are justified.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they directly link the code behavior to malicious activity.  \n  **Confirmed:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  The scores align well with the described behavior. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate.  \n  **Confirmed:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional observations:\n- The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- The import of `requests` and `getpass` is unnecessary and could be an attempt to obfuscate or distract, but this is not explicitly stated in the reports.  \n- The hardcoded IP and port, along with the reverse shell, strongly indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code **definitely** contains malicious behavior: establishing a reverse shell during installation.\n- The **malware score** should be **1** (full malware designation).\n- The **security risk score** should be **1** (maximum risk).\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | **1**               | Clear reverse shell, malicious backdoor behavior             |\n| securityRisk      | **1**               | High risk due to remote control, data exfiltration potential |\n| obfuscated        | **0**               | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present              |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nGiven the high confidence and the explicit malicious behavior, this package should be flagged as malicious, and its distribution should be halted or reviewed thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The scores are appropriate but should be set to maximum (1) for malware and security risk.  \n- The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscated score remains 0.",
