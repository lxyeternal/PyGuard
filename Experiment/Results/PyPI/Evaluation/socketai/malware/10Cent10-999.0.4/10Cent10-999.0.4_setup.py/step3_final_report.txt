  "purpose": "Establishes a reverse shell during package installation, enabling remote control of the system.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to 104.248.19.57:3333, initiated during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2(s.fileno(),0), os.dup2(s.fileno(),1), os.dup2(s.fileno(),2), and pty.spawn('/bin/sh') redirecting I/O and spawning a shell.",
  "flows": "Socket connection is established, duplicated to stdin, stdout, stderr, then a shell is spawned, providing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Outbound connection to external IP during installation, spawning a shell without user consent, hardcoded IP address, no legitimate purpose for such behavior in setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, creates a socket to an external IP, redirects standard streams to this socket, and spawns a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell backdoor. The behavior is explicit, not obfuscated, and highly suspicious. The imported modules 'requests' and 'getpass' are unused, possibly as distraction. The malicious activity is clear and consistent across all observations. The scores assigned in the reports (close to 1 for malware and security risk, 0 for obfuscation) are justified given the code's actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious reverse shell operation during installation, constituting a severe security threat. The scores of malware and security risk should be set to 1. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The package should be flagged as malicious and removed or reviewed for security compliance.",
