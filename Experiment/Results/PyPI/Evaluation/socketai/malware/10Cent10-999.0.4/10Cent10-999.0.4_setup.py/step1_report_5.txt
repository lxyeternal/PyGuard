{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation procedure designed to establish a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to IP 104.248.19.57 on port 3333 during the custom install run method.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and pty.spawn('/bin/sh') potentially allow remote command execution and control, leading to remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomInstall class's run method executes, creating a socket connection to an external server, redirecting standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawning a shell, enabling remote control of the host machine.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded IP address and port, and establishes a reverse shell during installation without any user consent or indication. The code imports unnecessary modules (requests, getpass) that are not used, possibly to obfuscate or distract. The description 'Exfiltration' further indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the default install process with a custom class. This class, when run, connects to an external IP address and port, then redirects system input/output/error streams to this connection, and spawns a shell. These actions are typical of malicious backdoors or remote access Trojans (RATs). The hardcoded IP and port, combined with the creation of a reverse shell during installation, pose a significant security threat. The presence of unused imports (requests, getpass) suggests possible obfuscation or leftover code. The package name and description hint at malicious intent ('Exfiltration'). Overall, the code's behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious backdoor that, during installation, connects to an external server and provides remote shell access, posing a severe security risk. It is highly malicious and should be treated as malicious malware.",
