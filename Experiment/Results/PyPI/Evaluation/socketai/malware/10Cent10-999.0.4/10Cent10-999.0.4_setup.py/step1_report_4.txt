  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to include a backdoor that connects to an external server and spawns a shell.",
  "sources": "socket connection to 104.248.19.57 on port 3333 during installation.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 and pty.spawn which redirect input/output to the socket and spawn a shell.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code establishes a socket connection to the external server, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, and spawns a shell connected to the socket.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently connects to an external IP and spawns a shell during package installation without any user notification or explicit intent. Use of socket, os.dup2, and pty.spawn in this context is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, initiates a TCP connection to an external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3333. After connecting, it redirects the process's standard input, output, and error to the socket using os.dup2, then spawns a shell (/bin/sh) via pty.spawn. This effectively creates a remote backdoor that allows an attacker to control the compromised system remotely during or after installation. The code is minimal but explicitly designed for malicious remote access, which constitutes a backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that establishes a remote backdoor by connecting to an external server and spawning a shell during installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, violating security principles and exposing the system to significant risk.",
