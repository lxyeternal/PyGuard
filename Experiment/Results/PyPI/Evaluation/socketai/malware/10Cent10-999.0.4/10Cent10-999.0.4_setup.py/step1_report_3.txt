{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from network socket connections (s.connect), and the import statements (requests, socket, getpass, os, pty).",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the socket (through dup2 and pty.spawn), executes a shell (pty.spawn), and establishes a network connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "The code creates a socket connection to a remote IP (104.248.19.57:3333), redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell, allowing remote control over the infected machine.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class immediately connects to an external IP during installation and spawns a shell, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior for a legitimate setup script. No benign purpose justifies this behavior. No credentials or sensitive data are hardcoded besides the IP, but the connection behavior itself is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for network and system operations. The CustomInstall class overrides the run method, executing the default install and then establishing a socket connection to a specific IP address. It then duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a shell. This indicates an intent to create a reverse shell, potentially allowing remote control of the system during or after installation. The setup configuration names the package '10Cent10' with a description 'Exfiltration,' which further suggests malicious intent. The IP address and port are hardcoded, typical of command-and-control or reverse shell behavior. Overall, this code contains malicious behavior embedded in a seemingly legitimate setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, implementing a reverse shell during package installation. It connects to an external server and provides remote control access, constituting a security risk. The purpose appears to be covert remote access, fitting a supply chain attack profile.",
