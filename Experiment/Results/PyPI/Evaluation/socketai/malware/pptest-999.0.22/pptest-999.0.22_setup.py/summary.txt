  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration via DNS, system info gathering, and sabotage of pip files. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~1.0, obfuscation ~0.2) are justified given the activities. It should be flagged as malicious, and further investigation or removal is recommended."
