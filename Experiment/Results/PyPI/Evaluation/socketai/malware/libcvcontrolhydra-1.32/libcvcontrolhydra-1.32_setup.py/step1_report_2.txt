{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package named 'libcvcontrolhydra' with specific metadata, and to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a certain file does not exist.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check, subprocess.Popen execution",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution potentially running obfuscated PowerShell command",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' file -> if not exists, run PowerShell command (potentially malicious) -> proceed with setup",
  "anomalies": "Execution of a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command that appears suspicious; no clear reason for its presence; use of try-except without handling exceptions; setup call is standard but is preceded by potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core. It then attempts to import subprocess and os. If a file named 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The command's purpose is unclear but could be used for malicious activity such as establishing a backdoor or exfiltrating data. Afterward, the setup function is called to define a package with metadata; this is standard but follows the suspicious code block. The try-except blocks are broad, swallowing exceptions silently, which can hide errors or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that executes silently is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The setup code itself is normal, but the preceding code suggests potential malware behavior such as remote access or system manipulation. Overall, the code contains malicious activity with a high likelihood score.",
