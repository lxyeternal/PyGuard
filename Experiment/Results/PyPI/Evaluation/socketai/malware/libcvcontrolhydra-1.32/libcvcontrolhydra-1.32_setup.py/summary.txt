  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command triggered during setup. The package appears legitimate in structure but contains embedded malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, warranting further analysis of the payload before deployment."
