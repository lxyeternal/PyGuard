  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-confidence malicious payload—an encoded PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup. The obfuscation, external URL comment, silent execution, and error suppression strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be flagged or removed, and further analysis of the encoded payload is recommended."
