  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered during setup. The use of encoded commands and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high security concern."
