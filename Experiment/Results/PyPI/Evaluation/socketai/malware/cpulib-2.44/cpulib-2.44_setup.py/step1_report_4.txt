{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'cpulib', with some code attempting to execute a PowerShell command and then perform package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg' and potentially executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command, which is a potential sink for malicious code execution. The setup function itself is a benign operation for package installation.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code runs a PowerShell command through subprocess.Popen, which could execute arbitrary commands, possibly malicious, if the encoded command is harmful.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The command appears to be downloaded from a remote server ('dl.dr0b4x.com'), and it executes without any validation or logging. The setup code is wrapped in broad try-except blocks that suppress errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' for package setup. It then attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, which could be malicious behavior. The command is fetched from a suspicious domain and executed hiddenly, which is a common tactic for malware. The setup process itself seems legitimate but is wrapped with exception handling that conceals errors, potentially masking malicious activities. The overall structure indicates an attempt to conceal malicious code execution during setup. The package installation code appears standard and benign, but the initial PowerShell invocation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution, likely malicious, which could download and execute harmful payloads. The package setup code itself looks legitimate, but the hidden execution of external commands is a security concern. The overall risk is high due to the encoded remote script execution, and caution is advised before using or trusting this package.",
