  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task which cannot be determined from the empty input.",
  "sources": "There are no identifiable sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data reads in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks such as network connections, file writes, or sensitive data exposure points in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code is empty and does not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely empty; there are no functions, variables, or logic that could indicate unusual behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The submitted code contains no executable statements, no data handling, and no external interactions. Without any actual code content, there are no sources, sinks, or data flows to analyze. This indicates the code is either incomplete or intentionally minimal. Given this, no malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred from the code. The absence of code also suggests no obfuscation or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code provided is empty and does not contain any logic or data handling, posing no security risks or malicious behavior. It is essentially inert.",
