  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, obfuscation, and network activity.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded URLs, environment variables, network communication points, input functions, external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, eval/exec execution points, data exfiltration routines.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) leading to eval/exec or network transmission, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, hardcoded URLs, suspicious network activity, empty or minimal code snippets, inconsistent or overly high confidence scores for benign code.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 identifies suspicious patterns such as eval/exec, external communication, and obfuscation, justifying high malware (0.7), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores. Reports 2, 3, 4, and 5 show minimal or no code, benign patterns, or lack of suspicious features, with low scores for malware and obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Overall, the high suspicion in Report 1 warrants a high malware score, while the benign reports justifiably have low scores. Slight adjustments to overall aggregate scores could be made, but current scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are accurate and consistent with the evidence. Report 1's high scores reflect genuine suspicious activity, while the others are benign. No further adjustments are necessary.",
