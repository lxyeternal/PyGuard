      "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation, system API interactions, privilege escalation techniques, and conditional system modifications, all indicative of malicious intent. It is likely designed to perform covert system sabotage, privilege escalation, or backdoor activities. The high complexity and concealment strongly suggest malicious behavior, and the package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious until further forensic analysis confirms otherwise."
