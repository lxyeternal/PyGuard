  "purpose": "Detects malicious embedded PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check triggers execution of the encoded command; silent error handling masks failures.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command run silently; error suppression masks failures; conditional execution based on filesystem.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess. The command is obfuscated, likely base64-encoded, and runs silently, masking its behavior. The setup() function appears benign, but the embedded payload indicates malicious intent. Multiple reports recognize this pattern, assigning high malware (0.75-0.9), obfuscation (0.8-0.9), and risk scores (0.75-0.9). The silent execution and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious activity, such as payload download, backdoor, or data exfiltration. Given the evidence, the overall assessment is that this package is highly malicious with a malware score of 0.9, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.9.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this pattern, and the scores are justified. The package should be considered highly dangerous and avoided or further analyzed to decode the payload.",
