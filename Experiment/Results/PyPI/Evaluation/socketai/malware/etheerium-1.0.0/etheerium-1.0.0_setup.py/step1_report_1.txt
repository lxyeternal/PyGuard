  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'etheerium' with custom installation behavior that includes executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The encrypted data used in Fernet decryption ('gAAAAABmbvQGUERP4bzX2Wl78s_BCX_8mbXdMmvczNz27F368dlc1jcWKeJ4O7cRyZjvuGk8RJV4bkZfbqlDSZFcQBSL6IjClt9AaT1e6txRh0t2mFuypY4ym41dC_lkl5AWfV-uFJzRiCVJOe1q9-qq96R6MRRdFbwOuoixkd7jEjFluT7NAiCOdtADq2UI6pz9tG-LoJvwbWMIKInQwyoRblyaQiXUKZr1DwLAge-zNxP44Y7ohpw') and the Fernet key ('u_tmm2UgazOtkZ7eqt1UDfWDIo6uGt0TjxAJ7fv0T4c=') used for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via 'exec', which could run malicious or unintended code during installation.",
  "flows": "The encrypted code is decrypted using Fernet with the provided key, then executed directly with exec during the install process if OS is Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted code, use of 'exec' on decrypted data, and inclusion of what appears to be random or obfuscated strings. The use of Fernet encryption and dynamic execution strongly suggest obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command class that, during installation on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an encrypted payload with a static key, and executes the resulting code. The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, which indicates obfuscation and possible malicious activity such as installing backdoors, data exfiltration, or executing malicious code without user awareness. No legitimate setup purpose justifies executing decrypted code during installation, and the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains encrypted payload execution during installation, indicating malicious intent or at least malicious obfuscation. It likely aims to run arbitrary code on Windows machines when the package is installed. The use of static encryption keys and dynamic execution are significant security concerns. Overall, this package should be considered high risk for supply chain attacks.",
