{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'etheerium' with specific metadata and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'os' module, environment variables (via 'os.name'), and hardcoded byte strings for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code executes decrypted code via 'exec', which can run arbitrary code at installation time. It also imports potentially malicious modules ('requests', 'fernet') and decrypts payloads.",
  "flows": "Source: environment check and hardcoded encrypted data -> Sink: 'exec' of decrypted code, which executes arbitrary code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of encrypted payloads decrypted at runtime and execution of 'exec' on decrypted data. The variable names are obfuscated, and the decrypted payload is a base64-encoded string, indicating possible obfuscation. The 'install' class has an extremely long and obfuscated name. The 'setup' includes a custom 'install' command that executes code during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata with obfuscated variable names and long class names. Within a custom 'install' class, it conditionally executes code if the system OS is Windows. This code involves importing 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography', then decrypting and executing a payload with 'exec'. The decrypted payload is embedded as base64-encoded encrypted data, suggesting an attempt to conceal malicious code. The setup configuration specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used in the decrypted code execution path. The overall structure, especially the dynamic code execution at install time, is suspicious and typical of malicious package behavior aimed at running arbitrary code on target systems.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, encrypted code that executes dynamically during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with obfuscated variable names and runtime decryption, suggests malicious behavior rather than legitimate setup procedures.",
