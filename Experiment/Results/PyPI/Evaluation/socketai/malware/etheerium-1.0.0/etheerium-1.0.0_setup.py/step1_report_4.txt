  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'etheerium' package with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, decrypting code, and executing the decrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decrypted code, potentially executing malicious or unintended code at install time.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> decryption with Fernet -> execution via exec() during install -> potential malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded encrypted string for Fernet decryption, execution of decrypted code at install time, unusual obfuscation in variable/class names, encrypted code execution without any validation, absence of any clear legitimate purpose for dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom install command class with an obfuscated name. During the install process, if on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code using a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext. This runtime code execution at install time is highly suspicious, as it could be used to run malicious code, exfiltrate data, or establish backdoors. The obfuscated class name and encrypted code indicate intent to hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions with the decrypted code, nor does it validate or log its actions. Overall, this pattern strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing a backdoor or executing unauthorized code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated runtime code execution triggered during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted code, dynamic execution, and obfuscated identifiers strongly indicates malicious behavior. The package appears to be designed to execute hidden code during installation, which constitutes a security risk and suggests malicious intent.",
