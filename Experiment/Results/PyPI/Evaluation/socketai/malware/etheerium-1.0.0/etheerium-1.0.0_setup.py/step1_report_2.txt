{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'etheerium', including a custom install command that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, encrypted Fernet key and ciphertext, import statements for requests and Fernet, exec() call",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially untrusted code execution during installation",
  "flows": "On Windows, if os.name == 'nt', the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts encrypted payload, and executes it via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload decrypted at runtime, use of exec() on decrypted data, the presence of hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, no visible documentation or explanation of the decrypted code purpose",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package with metadata and a custom installation class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts a payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it with exec(), which is highly suspicious. The use of encrypted data and dynamic execution suggests potential malicious behavior, as it could be used to run arbitrary code during installation. The code's intent appears concealed, and such techniques are common in malicious package supply chain attacks. No other suspicious network activity or credential leakage is evident, but the runtime code execution is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious runtime decryption and execution mechanism triggered during installation on Windows. This pattern is indicative of malicious behavior, potentially installing backdoors, malware, or executing unauthorized actions. Due to the encrypted payload and dynamic execution, this package should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
