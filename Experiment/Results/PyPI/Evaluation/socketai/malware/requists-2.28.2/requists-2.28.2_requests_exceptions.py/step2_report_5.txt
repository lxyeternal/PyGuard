  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines custom exceptions for network and content errors.  \n- Findings: No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.  \n- Conclusion: Standard exception classes, safe, no risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: The code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no external data processing or dynamic code execution. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Exception classes for errors, including JSON decoding and warnings.  \n- Findings: No data leaks or malicious behavior; standard practice.  \n- Concerns: The import of JSONDecodeError from a relative module (.compat) warrants a minor check, but as presented, it appears normal.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- Justification: Slightly elevated securityRisk due to external module import, but no actual malicious activity. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Exception classes for various errors.  \n- Findings: No dynamic code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: Standard exception class definitions, safe.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Exception classes and warnings.  \n- Findings: No suspicious code or external interactions.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- Justification: Similar to above, minor securityRisk due to external import, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Exception classes for HTTP errors.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- Justification: Standard class definitions, safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate only class definitions for exceptions, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1) due to external module imports (.compat), but no actual security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minor concern due to external module import, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.**",
