  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the Requests library to handle various network and content errors.",
  "sources": "Importing exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules; raising and initializing custom exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; the code strictly defines exception classes without malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from external modules and defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for HTTP and request errors, including detailed initialization methods. It handles standard error cases such as timeouts, URL issues, SSL errors, and warnings. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are present. All classes serve to encapsulate error states; no external data handling or suspicious activities are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for the Requests library, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
