  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions for the Requests library, importing from urllib3 and compat modules, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** The code is purely class definitions, with no data flow, external output, or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies this as standard, benign code with no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, with attention to potential data leaks or error message exposure, but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Exception classes handle errors; no direct data processing or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the minimal risk associated with exception class definitions.\n- **Justification:** The slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) accounts for potential error message exposure, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard exception class definitions, with no malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, and the report's confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with import from urllib3 and compat; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** The import of JSONDecodeError from a relative module warrants a brief check, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk score accounts for potential issues with relative imports, but as presented, it’s standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and warnings; no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical exception module.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for the Requests library.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The slight securityRisk scores (0.1) in some reports are justified, given the potential for error message exposure, but not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — minimal, primarily due to the nature of exception handling code, which is inherently low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
