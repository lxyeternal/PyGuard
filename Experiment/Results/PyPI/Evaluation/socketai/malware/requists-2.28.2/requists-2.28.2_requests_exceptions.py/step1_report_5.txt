{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and warnings used in the requests library for handling various HTTP errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "Import of urllib3.exceptions.HTTPError and .compat.JSONDecodeError; class initializers and attribute access within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None present; exception classes do not process or execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception handling is standard and confined to error management.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes for a requests library, with inheritance, attribute handling, and docstrings. The structure and content are consistent with standard error handling modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard module for exception handling within the requests library. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
