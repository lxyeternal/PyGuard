{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various request and response errors in the Requests library, including connection issues, HTTP errors, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a relative compat module; class definitions that do not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; exception classes do not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data processing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The import of JSONDecodeError from a relative module (.compat) could be scrutinized, but appears standard within the library context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. The import from a relative module is typical for compatibility layers. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes serve as error containers without executing logic that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified due to the import source but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
