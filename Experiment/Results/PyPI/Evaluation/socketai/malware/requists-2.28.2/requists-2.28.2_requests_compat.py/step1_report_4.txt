{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and Python 3, including imports and version-specific adjustments for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, exception handling for optional modules (chardet, simplejson), standard library imports from collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables without processing untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code handles version compatibility and optional dependencies cleanly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules conditionally based on environment, handles optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson, and sets compatibility flags for Python 2/3. It does not execute any untrusted input, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to code injection or data leaks. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. All imports are standard and intended for compatibility and utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility module for the requests library, with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard import resolution and setup tasks without any suspicious operations or security risks.",
