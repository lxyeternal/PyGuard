  "purpose": "Compatibility layer managing imports and environment setup for Python 2 and 3, including optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports of chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, and standard library modules such as sys, collections, urllib, http, io.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import handling and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim, handling optional dependencies and setting version flags. It does not execute untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is standard for such modules, with no suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
