{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for different Python versions and imports necessary modules and functions for handling HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and other utilities in a consistent manner across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info via sys.version_info, importing modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and defining type aliases and type checks.",
  "sinks": "None of the source data directly feeds into potentially dangerous sinks; the code mainly imports modules and sets up compatibility, with no processing or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. Import statements and variable assignments are static and do not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code primarily handles compatibility and module imports without any obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes compatibility layers between Python 2 and 3, manages module imports with fallback options (e.g., chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json), and defines some type aliases. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data handling involving external input. All imports and definitions are standard for such compatibility modules. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module used in requests.compat. It performs no malicious actions, no security risks are evident, and it primarily sets up environment compatibility. The overall security risk is negligible.",
