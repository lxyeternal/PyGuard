{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for various Python versions and manages imports for handling encoding, JSON, and URL parsing functions in a backward-compatible way.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), conditional imports of external modules (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson/json)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports modules and defines compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code mainly handles imports and version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility checks for Python 2 and 3, manages conditional imports of optional modules (chardet, simplejson), and assigns compatibility variables. It imports standard modules for URL parsing, cookies, and string handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or code injection. The code is straightforward, structured, and consistent with typical compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a package supporting multiple Python versions.",
