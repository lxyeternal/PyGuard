  "purpose": "Compatibility and import resolution for Python 2 and 3, handling dependencies like chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for chardet, simplejson, json, and standard library modules such as collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external network communication present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; code primarily handles imports and compatibility adjustments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code strictly manages compatibility and imports without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs import statements with exception handling for optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson), manages Python version compatibility, and defines some utility variables. It does not process user input or data from untrusted sources. There are no network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for ensuring compatibility across Python versions and dependencies, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3 with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages imports and compatibility checks, which are common in library maintenance. No malicious or harmful code elements are present.",
