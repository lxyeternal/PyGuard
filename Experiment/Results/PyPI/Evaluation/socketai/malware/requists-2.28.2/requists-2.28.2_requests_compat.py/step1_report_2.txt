  ],
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up compatibility imports for Python 2 and 3, handling JSON parsing, URL handling, and HTTP proxy functions. It conditionally imports modules based on availability, and defines aliases for compatibility. There are no network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observed. The code performs environment setup without any suspicious logic or hidden activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for a Python library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for maintaining backwards compatibility.",
