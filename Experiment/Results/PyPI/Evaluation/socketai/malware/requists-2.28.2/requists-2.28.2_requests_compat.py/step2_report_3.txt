  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily about compatibility management, conditional imports, and version-specific adjustments.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation.\n- The import statements and logic are standard for such compatibility modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility and import resolution.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code handles dependencies like chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code, no data flows.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility imports and setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the conditional imports, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is standard compatibility setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility for Python 2 and 3, with imports.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no untrusted data is processed, no network or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is a benign compatibility layer.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility handling, version-specific adjustments.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is only about import management and compatibility.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Compatibility management, import handling.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no malicious activity, no data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely about compatibility and imports, with no security risks.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \nGiven the code's straightforward nature, these scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final reasoning:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility shim used in many Python projects, especially in open-source libraries like `requests`.\n- It handles optional dependencies gracefully, with no malicious intent.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no code execution beyond imports.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is a typical compatibility module.",
