    "import of standard libraries with additional base64-encoded code execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard implementation of the requests library, including dependency checks and environment preparations. However, the presence of multiple exec() calls executing decoded base64 data is highly unusual and suspicious. These exec() calls could potentially execute malicious code hidden within the base64 strings. The rest of the code appears legitimate, but the obfuscated code injection indicates a possible attempt to conceal malicious behavior or hidden functionality. Without decoding the base64 strings, it's difficult to definitively determine their purpose, but this pattern is often associated with malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The core of the code is legitimate, focusing on HTTP requests and dependency management. Nonetheless, the multiple base64-encoded exec() calls are a significant security concern, as they could run malicious code undetected. This pattern is characteristic of obfuscated malware or backdoors embedded within otherwise normal-looking code.",
