  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation through multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, strongly suggesting malicious intent or backdoors. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution pose significant security risks, and further decoding of payloads is necessary to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, and the package should be treated with caution."
