{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a modified version of the Requests library, with obfuscated segments and base64-encoded code injections. Its primary purpose is to provide an HTTP client interface.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded exec() calls decoding payloads, import statements, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "exec() functions executing decoded base64 payloads; potential network request functions that could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Initial dependency checks and environment setup, followed by execution of base64-decoded code via exec(), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution at startup, concealed strings, and potential malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple exec() calls decoding base64 strings and executing them, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and potential malicious activity. These payloads are hidden and could contain backdoors, data exfiltration routines, or other malicious code. The structure mimics legitimate requests library code but is tainted by concealed code execution. The obfuscation pattern and dynamic execution are typical in malware to hide malicious intent. Without decoding the payloads, the risk remains high, but the pattern itself warrants suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation through multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, strongly suggesting malicious intent or backdoors. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution pose significant security risks, and further decoding of payloads is necessary to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, and the package should be treated with caution.",
