  ],
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple exec() calls with base64-decoded data is highly unusual for a standard library. The decoded content could contain malicious code or backdoors. No explicit code in visible parts suggests malicious intent, but dynamic code execution raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions to verify dependency versions and compatibility for the requests library. It includes several import statements, version checks, and configuration of warnings and logging. The suspicious aspect is the multiple exec() calls executing base64-decoded code, which can be used to hide malicious activities. The decoded data could potentially introduce malicious behavior or backdoors, especially since the actual content of the decoded data is not visible before execution. The overall structure aligns with legitimate package setup and runtime checks, but the presence of obfuscated exec() commands significantly increases risk.",
  "conclusion": "While the majority of the code appears standard for a Python HTTP library, the use of exec() with base64 decoding is suspicious and potentially malicious. This pattern can be exploited to hide malicious code or backdoors, making this a high security concern. Further investigation of the decoded content is recommended before use.",
