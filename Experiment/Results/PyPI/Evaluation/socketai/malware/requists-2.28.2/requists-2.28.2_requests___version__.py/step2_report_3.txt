  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in question is a set of variable assignments defining package metadata for the 'requests' library.\n- It contains no dynamic code, no input/output, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious intent.\n- The ASCII art at the top is purely decorative and not suspicious.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, metadata-only.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, emphasizing standard metadata.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, metadata-only.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior justified?** No. The code is purely metadata, with no code execution or external data handling.\n- **Is there any inconsistency?** No. All reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**; the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score should be **0**; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, static metadata, with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
