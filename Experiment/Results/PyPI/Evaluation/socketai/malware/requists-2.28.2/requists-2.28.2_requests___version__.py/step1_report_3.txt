  "purpose": "To define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author information, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments and metadata variables initialized directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data handling or input/output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or input-output paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code consists solely of metadata assignments with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static metadata variables describing the 'requests' library. No input handling, data processing, or executable logic is present. The variables are assigned simple string or integer values, and no external data or environment variables are used. The presence of ASCII art is purely decorative and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward package metadata without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
