  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for metadata fields such as __title__, __description__, __url__, etc.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "None; all data is static and assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of metadata variable assignments and ASCII art comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata declarations describing the 'requests' package, including version, author, license, and descriptive info. The ASCII art at the top is a stylized comment. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable in this static, metadata-only fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, containing only package metadata and comments. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
