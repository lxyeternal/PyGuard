  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python package, including package info such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.). No external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is static and assigns constants only.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with decorative comments. No functions, data flows, network activity, or dynamic code are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, static metadata. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no potential security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code content. No modifications are necessary.",
