  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' function from certifi package; calling 'where()' in main block.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'where()' is printed; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print(where()) in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it when executed directly. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious patterns. It does not handle untrusted input or perform any network operations. The purpose appears to be simply to report the location of the CA bundle, which is typical in environment setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended to report the certifi CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is simple, clear, and safe.",
