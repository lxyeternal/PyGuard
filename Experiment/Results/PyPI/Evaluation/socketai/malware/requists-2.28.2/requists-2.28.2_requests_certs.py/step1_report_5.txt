{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the certifi.where() function.",
  "sinks": "The printed CA bundle path is exposed as output, but this does not lead to security vulnerability.",
  "flows": "The code imports the CA bundle location and outputs it via print(), with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs a straightforward function with no unusual or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' and prints its result if executed directly. There are no user inputs, no data manipulation, and no network activity or sensitive data handling. The purpose appears to be to display the path to the default CA bundle for the 'certifi' package, likely for informational or packaging purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and purpose-specific. It merely outputs the default CA certificate bundle location provided by certifi without performing any risky operations or handling untrusted data. No security concerns or malware indicators are present.",
