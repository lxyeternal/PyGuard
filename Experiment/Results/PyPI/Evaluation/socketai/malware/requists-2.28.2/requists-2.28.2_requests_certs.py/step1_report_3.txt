{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL certificate verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where()' function imported from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the CA bundle file.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks or vice versa.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code simply imports a function and prints its result; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the script merely outputs a known, static file path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed as the main module. This function returns the path to the trusted CA bundle used for SSL verification. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network connections. The code's purpose is benign, intended to inform about the CA bundle location. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility script that outputs the path to the CA certificate bundle from the 'certifi' package. It performs no malicious actions or data leaks and appears to be a standard, safe component related to SSL certificate verification.",
