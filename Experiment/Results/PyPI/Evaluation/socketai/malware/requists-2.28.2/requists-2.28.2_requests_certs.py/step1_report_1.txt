  "flows": "Imports 'where' -> executes 'print(where())' -> outputs CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code simply outputs a file path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' to retrieve the CA bundle location and prints it.
