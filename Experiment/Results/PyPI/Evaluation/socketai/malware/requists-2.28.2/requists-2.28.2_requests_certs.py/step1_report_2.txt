  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it if run as a script. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets. The code serves a simple utility purpose. The presence of the comment and structure shows intention for configuration but no malicious intent is evident.",
