{
  "purpose": "Outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi', executed in the main block to print its value.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Source: import of 'where'; sink: print(where()); flow is straightforward, from import to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple, static, and uses trusted library functions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function and prints its output without any user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It serves a benign purpose of reporting the CA bundle location. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that reports the CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
