  "purpose": "Implement utility data structures: CaseInsensitiveDict for case-insensitive key handling, and LookupDict as a simple named dictionary.",
  "sources": "Initialization via __init__, update methods, and item access methods (__getitem__, __setitem__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Representation (__repr__), iteration (__iter__), and data access methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into internal OrderedDict storage, then to representations or retrievals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard collections, and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for managing key-value pairs with specific behaviors. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data handling is present. Keys are normalized to lowercase for case-insensitive behavior, and original casing is preserved for iteration. Both classes are implemented using standard Python collections, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves as utility within the Requests library. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of data structures with no security risks or malicious intent. The previously assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are correct. The high security risk scores (close to 1) in some reports are unjustified; a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) better reflects the benign nature of this code. Overall, the code is suitable for use without concerns.",
