  "purpose": "Define custom dictionary-like classes with case-insensitive keys and simple lookup features, intended for use within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, user interactions via __getitem__, __setitem__, and other dictionary methods.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval methods (__getitem__, get), data storage (__setitem__, __init__), and representation (__repr__).",
  "flows": "Input data flows into __init__ and __setitem__, stored in internal _store or __dict__, accessed via __getitem__, get, or __repr__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. Use of standard collections and simple attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard dictionary behaviors with added case-insensitivity in CaseInsensitiveDict. No code exhibits external data leakage, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity. The code relies solely on standard collections (OrderedDict and dict) and basic method definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions are straightforward and serve as data structures for internal request processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard, non-malicious custom dictionary-like objects for request handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be clean, intended for case-insensitive header management or lookup utilities within the Requests library.",
