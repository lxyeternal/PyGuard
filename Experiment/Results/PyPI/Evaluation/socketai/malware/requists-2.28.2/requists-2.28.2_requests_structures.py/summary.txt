  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of data structures with no security risks or malicious intent. The previously assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are correct. The high security risk scores (close to 1) in some reports are unjustified; a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) better reflects the benign nature of this code. Overall, the code is suitable for use without concerns."
