{
  "purpose": "Provide data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data updates (update), and __getitem__ methods for accessing stored data.",
  "sinks": "Methods like __getitem__, __delitem__, and get, which access internal data stores.",
  "flows": "Data is set via __setitem__ and stored in internal dictionaries, then retrieved through __getitem__, __delitem__, or get methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily implements standard dictionary-like classes with case-insensitivity features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, which extend standard dict behaviors. The first class handles case-insensitive keys by normalizing to lowercase and storing the original key. The second provides a simple lookup object with an optional name attribute. Both classes use standard Python features without any network calls, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present; the code appears to be straightforward data structure implementations intended for use within the Requests library. The absence of external data inputs or untrusted data processing in the provided code reduces the risk of data leaks or injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup objects, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and unaltered, serving purely as utility data structures within the Requests library.",
