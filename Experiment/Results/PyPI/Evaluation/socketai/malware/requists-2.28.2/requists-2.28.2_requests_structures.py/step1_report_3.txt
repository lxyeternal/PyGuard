{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionary and lookup dictionary used in requests.",
  "sources": "Data is provided through the constructor (__init__), update method, or item assignment (__setitem__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor or update method to internal storage, and from get/set/del methods to internal storage; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated language features, or suspicious logic; the code implements standard data structures without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages a case-insensitive dictionary by storing keys in lowercase but retaining original casing for display, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary with optional naming. Both classes do not process external untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks. No external network activity, environment variable access, or system commands are present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The code is standard, well-structured, and designed for data management within requests handling, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard data structure implementation for request headers or lookup purposes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use.",
