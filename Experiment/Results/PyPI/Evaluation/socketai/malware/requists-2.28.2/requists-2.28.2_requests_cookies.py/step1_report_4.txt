  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, header creation, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers (e.g., get_header, has_header), extracting cookies from responses (extract_cookies_to_jar), cookie jar access methods (get, set, __getitem__, __delitem__), cookie creation functions (create_cookie, morsel_to_cookie).",
  "sinks": "Constructing cookie headers (get_cookie_header), modifying cookie jars (set, update, remove_cookie_by_name), creating cookies (create_cookie), updating cookies from dicts or other jars, internal cookie management methods.",
  "flows": "Request headers (source) are read and used to generate cookie headers (sink). Cookies are extracted from responses into jar objects. Cookie jars are accessed and modified via set/get methods, potentially involving create_cookie or morsel_to_cookie functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for cookie management, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Functions like remove_cookie_by_name allow explicit cookie removal, which is typical. No obfuscated code, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily utility functions and classes for cookie handling, including cookie jar compatibility, extraction, creation, and management. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are evident. The functions operate within expected parameters, handling cookies securely and predictably. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code structure and logic follow standard practices for cookie management in Python. No hardcoded secrets or external system interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It provides mechanisms to handle cookies safely and efficiently without any indication of malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, it appears safe with a low malware score.",
