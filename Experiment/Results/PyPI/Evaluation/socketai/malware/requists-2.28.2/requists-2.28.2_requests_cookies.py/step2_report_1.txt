  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report confirms that the code is standard cookie management code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Given the benign nature, the security risk score could be lowered to 0, since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** Not applicable; the report's assessment aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is legitimate, standard, and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report describes typical cookie handling utilities with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. The risk score could be further reduced to 0, as there's no evident security concern.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign and purely utility-focused.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The analysis indicates standard cookie management functions without malicious intent.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. The risk score can be lowered to 0 for the same reasons.\n- **Overall assessment:** No security risks detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The report confirms the code is typical cookie management code.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Can be reduced to 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is utility code for cookie handling, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Can be lowered to 0.\n- **Overall assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, utility-focused, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are slightly above 0 (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), but given the benign nature, these should be adjusted to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely utility functions for cookie management, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Note:** The original scores for risk are slightly elevated but should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie handling utilities.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Scores should be adjusted to reflect a **malware: 0**, **obfuscated: 0**, and **risk: 0**.",
