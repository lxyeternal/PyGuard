  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads request URLs, headers, and cookie attributes; reads and writes to cookie jars; processes cookie parameters and headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie jar modifications, and cookie extraction to jars. No data leaks or sensitive data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → Cookie extraction/modification functions → Cookie jar updates/queries → Cookie header generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets; functions handle cookies as expected. No obfuscated code or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes and functions for cookie handling, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, and cookie jar manipulation. The logic is standard and appears intended for cookie compatibility and management within requests. No suspicious network communication, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The functions handle data safely without executing untrusted code or leaking data. Overall, the code is a typical, well-structured cookie management module with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing cookies in HTTP requests. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration, and the structure is consistent with normal cookie handling procedures.",
