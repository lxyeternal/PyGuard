  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie management, including request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, creation, merging, and header generation, to facilitate cookie handling in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reading request URLs, headers, and response headers; creating cookies; manipulating cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie jar updates, cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "External input (request/response headers) -> cookie creation/extraction -> cookie jar updates or header outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie handling utilities, wrapping request and response objects to facilitate cookie extraction, creation, and management. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions operate within expected parameters for cookie management, handling untrusted input safely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign, utility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard cookie management utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be maintained at malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1, reflecting its safe and benign purpose.",
