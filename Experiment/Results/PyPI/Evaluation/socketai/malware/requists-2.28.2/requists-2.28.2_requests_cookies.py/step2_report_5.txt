  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard cookie utility functions, wrappers, and extraction routines.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The functions align with typical cookie management.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate and benign. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the utility scope, it's acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on cookie management, extraction, and header generation.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is standard for cookie handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly benign. Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management, with focus on compatibility and data handling.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation detected. The functions process external data in a standard way.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent. Malware score of 0 is correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar scope—cookie handling, extraction, creation, and merging.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard utility code. Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie management, extraction, and header handling.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign. Malware score of 0 is correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or code present.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — standard cookie management utilities, low risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The current scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain low security risk scores, as the code is utility-focused and does not perform sensitive operations.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal; it is safe and appropriate for production use.",
