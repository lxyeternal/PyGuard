  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides cookie compatibility utilities, wrapping request and response objects, extracting cookies, and generating headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, and cookie manipulation are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code aligns with typical cookie handling utilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given utility nature)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for cookie management, reading from response headers, request URLs, and cookie dicts.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are created, stored, and headers generated in a typical manner.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity detected. The code is straightforward utility code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign cookie management code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, handling cookies from request/response data, creating, merging, deleting cookies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are manipulated based on external input, which is expected for such utilities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code handles untrusted input safely within its scope.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard utility code, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for cookie utilities)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management functions, including create, delete, merge, extract.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Handles cookie data from headers and request parameters, with no network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign utility code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie extraction, header creation, and jar management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard cookie handling, no data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical cookie management code, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—standard cookie utilities with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the utility scope and no evident security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard utility code with no known vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe provided scores across all reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured utility code for cookie management within the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
