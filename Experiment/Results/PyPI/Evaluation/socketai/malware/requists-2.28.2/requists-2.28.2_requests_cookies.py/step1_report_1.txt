{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including classes and functions for managing cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Requests and responses are read from the request object (e.g., request URL, headers, cookies) and response headers; cookies are extracted from response headers via extract_cookies_to_jar.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation (get_cookie_header), cookie manipulation methods (set, delete, update), and potential data leakage points when handling cookie values or headers.",
  "flows": "Input data from request URL and headers flows into cookie extraction and cookie creation functions; cookies are added/removed via set/delete methods; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies are stored and retrieved from the jar.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard cookie management functions with no evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The 'add_header' method intentionally raises NotImplementedError, which is typical for security reasons. No obfuscated code patterns or unusual dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements cookie handling utilities, including mock request/response wrappers for compatibility, cookie extraction from responses, cookie creation, and a dictionary-like interface for cookie jars. It includes functions for removing, merging, and creating cookies, with standard parameter validation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The presence of functions like 'extract_cookies_to_jar' and 'get_cookie_header' is consistent with normal cookie processing routines. The implementation appears legitimate and aligns with standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It facilitates cookie management for HTTP requests and responses and does not perform any harmful actions.",
