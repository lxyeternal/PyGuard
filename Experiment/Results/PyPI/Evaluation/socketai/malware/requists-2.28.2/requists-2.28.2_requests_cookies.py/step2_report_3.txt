  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie handling utilities, including mock request/response wrappers, cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation functions. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Analysis:** The functions and classes are standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The code operates within expected parameters for cookie management.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, reflecting general utility functions).\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's content. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing cookie management utilities, extraction, and header generation. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code appears straightforward and benign, handling cookies from HTTP headers and request parameters.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent with the code; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on cookie compatibility, creation, extraction, and merging. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis:** The functions process untrusted input but do so as part of standard cookie handling. No network activity or suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment matches the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code performs expected cookie operations, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie management utilities, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for cookie handling, with no network activity or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no network activity, no code obfuscation, no suspicious data handling, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in all reports, reflecting the utility nature of the code and potential for misuse if untrusted data is fed into functions, but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is purely utility for cookie management, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly above zero due to the handling of untrusted input, but overall very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The entire codebase is a standard, legitimate set of utilities for cookie handling within the requests library. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security compromise is present. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware/obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
