{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, including URL parsing, header validation, body encoding, cookie management, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, data streams, files, JSON payloads, cookies, hooks, and response raw data.",
  "sinks": "Headers, URL, request body, cookies, and response content, with proper validation and encoding to prevent injection or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request construction (headers, URL, body, cookies), then into network transmission, and response content flows into decoding and parsing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, no malicious code patterns, and no unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for URL handling, header validation, JSON encoding, multipart encoding, cookie management, and response decoding. It includes error handling for common issues and does not contain dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The structure is clear, and the functions follow typical patterns for HTTP client libraries. No suspicious external activity or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response module. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, consistent with its role as a core library component.",
