{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions related to constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "User inputs for URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks; also internal method calls for encoding and preparing request components.",
  "sinks": "Execution points for encoding parameters, setting headers, handling cookies, preparing request bodies, and reading response content.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, headers, body data, files, cookies, hooks) flows into request preparation methods, which encode, validate, and set request components; responses flow from network raw data to parsed content and JSON decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration code present. Use of standard libraries and methods appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to the design of constructing and handling HTTP requests and responses. It uses well-established encoding, URL parsing, and cookie handling. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity. The security-related functions focus on proper encoding, validation, and error handling. No signs of malicious data leakage, code injection, or sabotage. The code is standard and appears to be a legitimate part of a request handling library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of request and response handling in the Requests library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It follows expected patterns for request preparation and response processing, with no suspicious anomalies.",
