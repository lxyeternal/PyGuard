{
  "purpose": "This module defines classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, including URL building, header management, body encoding, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings, headers, data and JSON payloads, files, cookies, and hooks supplied during Request and PreparedRequest creation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be injected into headers, URL parameters, request bodies, or cookies. Response content is read and decoded in Response class, but no system data or credentials are directly accessed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request inputs (headers, data, files, cookies, URL) through encoding and preparation methods, then into the request object; response data is read, decoded, and returned. No evidence of malicious data manipulation or exfiltration occurs within the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive data validation, URL encoding, header checks, and proper handling of request components. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malicious side effects are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP request/response handling with appropriate data validation, URL encoding, header management, and error handling. It encodes parameters, builds multipart bodies, manages cookies and hooks, and decodes response content responsibly. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are found. The structure is consistent with an open-source HTTP library, focusing on functionality and security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, well-structured HTTP request/response handling module with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within the provided scope. It uses standard practices for encoding, URL handling, and error management, with no evident backdoors or data leaks.",
