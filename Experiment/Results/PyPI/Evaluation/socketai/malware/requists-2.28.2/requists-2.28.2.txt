      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with minimal security concerns. The primary risk is reliance on the integrity of the version file due to exec(). No malware or obfuscation present. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a risk score around 0.2–0.3 mainly due to exec() usage."

The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified due to the import source but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities."

      "obfuscated": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation through multiple base64-encoded exec() calls, strongly suggesting malicious intent or backdoors. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution pose significant security risks, and further decoding of payloads is necessary to confirm malicious activity. Overall, the pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, and the package should be treated with caution."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of data structures with no security risks or malicious intent. The previously assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are correct. The high security risk scores (close to 1) in some reports are unjustified; a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) better reflects the benign nature of this code. Overall, the code is suitable for use without concerns."

It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The unusual sys.modules manipulation is a potential vector for misuse but is intended for compatibility. The overall security risk is low, and the code is benign."
