  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task, but the exact goal cannot be determined from the provided snippet due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and potentially from network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to files, displays outputs, or sends data over network connections; specifics are unclear without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like files or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected from the provided snippet. Due to the absence of visible code, it's difficult to identify hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The review process could not be fully completed because the actual code content was not provided. Without concrete code, it's impossible to identify source and sink locations, data flows, or anomalies. Standard security concerns such as hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity cannot be confirmed without the code details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be conclusively identified. The code appears benign; however, this assessment is limited due to missing code content.",
