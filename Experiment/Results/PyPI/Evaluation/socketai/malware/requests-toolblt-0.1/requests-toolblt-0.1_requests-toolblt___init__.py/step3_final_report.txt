{
  "purpose": "The code performs standard utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, input streams, or files; no external network or untrusted data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs via print, return, or file writes; no untrusted data effects or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment or input sources to outputs or internal processing; no malicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with benign data handling and no external or suspicious operations. No malicious indicators or obfuscation are present. The environment and data flows are typical for utility scripts. Given the absence of external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns, the code is consistent with safe, standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The code is considered safe based on static analysis.",
