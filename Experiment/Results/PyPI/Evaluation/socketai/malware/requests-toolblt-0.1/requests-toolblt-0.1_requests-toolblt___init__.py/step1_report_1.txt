  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions within a larger application. No explicit malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and function parameters. There are no obvious external data inputs like network calls or file reads in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve print statements and return values. There are no indications of data being sent over the network or written to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters/environment variables) through processing functions, returning results without external or untrusted data being directed to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or apparent backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing typical utility operations without external dependencies that would indicate malicious behavior. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. It relies on standard Python features and typical coding patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, functioning as intended without suspicious or harmful features.",
