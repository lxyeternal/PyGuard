  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, including package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an empty string in 'install_requires' list ('['']'), which is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. The only anomaly is 'install_requires' set to [''], which is likely a typo or misconfiguration, not malicious. No dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. The minor anomaly does not pose security risks but should be corrected for best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with a minor misconfiguration in dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary beyond correcting the dependency list to an empty list if desired.",
