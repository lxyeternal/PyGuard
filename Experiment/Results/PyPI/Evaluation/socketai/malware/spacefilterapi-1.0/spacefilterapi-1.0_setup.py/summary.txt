  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with a minor misconfiguration in dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary beyond correcting the dependency list to an empty list if desired."
