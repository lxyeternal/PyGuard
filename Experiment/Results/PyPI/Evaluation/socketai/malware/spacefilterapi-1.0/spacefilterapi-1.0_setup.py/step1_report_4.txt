  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'spacefilterapi' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'install_requires' list; minimal setup code, no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static parameters, defining package metadata. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, input handling, or external data processing. The 'install_requires' field is empty, indicating no dependencies, which is not suspicious. The overall structure is standard for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious commands, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
