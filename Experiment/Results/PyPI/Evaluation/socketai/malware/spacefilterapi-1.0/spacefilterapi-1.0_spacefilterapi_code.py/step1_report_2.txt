{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then upload and transmit this data to a remote server, primarily targeting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other files for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Sources include local browser data directories, application directories, log files, and database files such as 'Login Data' and 'Cookies'. It also reads environment variables, environment-specific files like 'Local State', and user directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a specified Discord webhook URL using HTTP POST requests, including tokens, user info, cookies, passwords, and files. Files are uploaded to anonymous file hosting services, and data is transmitted via URL requests.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is collected from various sources (browser data, databases, log files), decrypted or parsed, stored temporarily in memory, and then transmitted to external servers via HTTP requests or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "The code features hardcoded webhook URLs, functions that install Python modules silently, attempts to decrypt browser data and cookies using Windows-specific APIs, and aggressive file collection methods. It also kills processes associated with certain applications before zipping files, indicating attempts to bypass security or cleanup artifacts. The presence of multiple threading for data collection and zipping, and the use of obfuscated or misleading variable names (e.g., 'hook', 'upths'), suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured as a malicious data stealer, designed to harvest tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptographic APIs, collects user data from directories, and uploads everything to external servers controlled by the attacker. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent module installation, process termination commands, and aggressive file collection indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate functions but focuses solely on data exfiltration. The code also attempts to obscure its activities through threading and obfuscated variable names, and it kills specific processes to ensure access to data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior as a comprehensive information-stealing malware. It systematically collects sensitive user data from browsers and applications, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates the data to remote servers. Its design, use of Windows APIs, hardcoded webhooks, and process-killing tactics confirm malicious intent. This package should not be used and is highly dangerous.",
