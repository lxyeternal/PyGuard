{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer, targeting browser stored data (cookies, passwords, tokens), Discord info, files matching specific keywords, and exfiltrating all collected data via webhooks and file uploads. It decrypts stored credentials, kills processes to access data, and silently installs dependencies, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Browser storage directories, local state files, logs, user directories, application data folders, and specific application folders such as Steam, Riot, and wallets.",
  "sinks": "Webhooks (Discord API), third-party file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles), and local files containing stolen data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from various sources, decrypted if encrypted, formatted, and then exfiltrated via network requests or file uploads. The code also kills processes to access locked data and uses threading for concurrent operations.",
  "anomalies": "Silent installation of modules, process termination commands, use of Windows API for decryption, broad directory scanning, obfuscated variable names, and hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts stored cookies and passwords using Windows APIs and AES-GCM, extracts tokens from logs, collects user info, billing, badges, and files based on keywords. It kills processes like browsers and wallets to access data, then exfiltrates via webhooks and uploads. It employs threading for parallel operations, silent dependency installation, and process termination to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and broad data collection scope confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer, exhibiting behaviors typical of malware designed for extensive data exfiltration and system compromise. Its activities are consistent with known info-stealing malware, and the overall security risk is extremely high.",
