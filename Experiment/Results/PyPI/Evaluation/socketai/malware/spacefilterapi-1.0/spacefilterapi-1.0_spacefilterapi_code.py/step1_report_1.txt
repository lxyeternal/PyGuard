{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user data, including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating the data via Discord webhooks or uploading to file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Data is read from browser storage (LevelDB, SQLite databases), local state files, log files, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. Inputs include environment variables, files, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs through POST requests to Discord webhooks and file uploads to third-party file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles). Data sent includes tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and user info.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is collected from local browser storage, decrypted (for cookies and passwords), then stored in variables. The data is formatted into Discord webhook payloads or uploaded files, then sent over the network. There are also functions for file collection and zipping, which are then uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "The script attempts to silently install missing Python modules, uses thread-based parallel processing for data collection, kills processes like browsers and Steam, and uploads data automatically without user consent. It also contains hardcoded webhook URLs, and the code's structure obscures the malicious intent. Extensive use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'da', 'a') and dynamic code execution hints at obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing various modules, including ones for network, cryptography, and system interaction. It installs dependencies silently if missing. Functions for decrypting Windows stored data (e.g., cookies, credentials) are implemented. It extracts tokens from browser logs, decrypts passwords, cookies, and gathers user info via Discord API. It kills processes like browsers and Steam to access locked files. Data is stored in global variables, formatted, and exfiltrated via webhooks or uploaded files. The script searches common directories for files with sensitive keywords, compresses them, and uploads. Multithreading accelerates data collection from multiple sources. Overall, all actions point towards a credential-stealing malware, with mechanisms to avoid detection by killing processes and installing dependencies. The code actively exfiltrates data without user consent, making its purpose malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed as a credential stealer targeting browser data, Discord tokens, files, and user information, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and file uploads. Its structure and behavior are consistent with malware aimed at data theft and privacy invasion.",
