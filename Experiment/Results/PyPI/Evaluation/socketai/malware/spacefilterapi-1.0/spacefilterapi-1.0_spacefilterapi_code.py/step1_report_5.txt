{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories. It then exfiltrates the collected data via webhooks and uploads to file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data, cookies), process memory, and network requests to external services for geolocation and token validation.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a Discord webhook, uploaded to file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles), and possibly copied or written to local files. The code also runs external processes, kills processes, and installs Python modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local data extraction (browsers, applications, files) through decryption and parsing functions, then to exfiltration functions that send data to remote servers or upload files. Token validation and data collection functions act as intermediate steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, dynamic module installation, process termination commands, code that handles encrypted browser data, and functions that exfiltrate sensitive info. Excessive use of threading for obfuscation, and suspicious directory paths are also notable. The code collects extensive user data, including geolocation, Discord info, files, cookies, passwords, and tokens.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to harvest sensitive user data by scanning common browser and application directories, decrypting stored passwords and cookies, extracting Discord tokens, and collecting files based on keywords. It uses multiple threads to speed up collection. It decrypts Windows protected data via Windows API calls and AES decryption. The code then formats this data into messages and uploads them via webhooks or to file hosts. It also kills certain processes (e.g., browser or wallet apps) to possibly prevent detection or interfere with user activities. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and automated module installation indicates an intent for persistent, covert operation. Overall, the code exhibits typical behaviors of malware designed for data theft and exfiltration, with no benign functionality evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a comprehensive information stealer targeting browsers, applications, and user files. It exfiltrates data to external servers and uploads files, indicating malicious intent. It employs obfuscation techniques such as threading and dynamic code execution. The presence of hardcoded webhook and the nature of data collection strongly suggest malware behavior.",
