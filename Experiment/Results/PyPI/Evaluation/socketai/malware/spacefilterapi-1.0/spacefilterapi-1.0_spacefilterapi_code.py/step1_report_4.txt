{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from a user's system, and then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and uploads to third-party services.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from log files, browser storage (local storage, leveldb), SQLite databases (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Steam, wallets), and filesystem directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It also reads environment variables and network responses.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to external URLs via HTTP POST requests and webhooks, uploads files to file hosting services, and executes system commands to kill processes. It also writes data to local files in the TEMP directory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading local files and system storage (sources) into parsing and decrypting (potentially untrusted), then exfiltrates via HTTP requests to remote servers (sinks). Functions like getToken, getPassw, getCookie extract tokens and passwords; uploadToken and upload send this data externally. File zipping functions package data for upload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL embedded in the code, attempts to silently install missing dependencies, and process-killing commands for specific applications suggest malicious intent. Extensive collection of cookies, tokens, passwords, and files across various browsers and apps is suspicious. The code also decrypts stored credentials using Windows API functions, indicating targeted credential theft. The presence of functions that automate zipping and uploading sensitive files, and the use of randomization in filenames, are indicative of malicious data exfiltration activities.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to covertly collect sensitive user data including browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from specified directories. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, gathers Discord tokens, user info, billing info, and UHQ badges. It also harvests files from user directories based on keywords. The code contains mechanisms to silently install missing libraries, forcibly kill processes related to wallets and browsers, zip the collected data, and upload it to third-party servers. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, and functions dedicated to stealing Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and user files, clearly point to malicious intent. The code also attempts to hide its activity by randomizing filenames and operating in multiple threads. Overall, it performs comprehensive data theft activities, exfiltrates sensitive info, and employs techniques typical of malware and spyware.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious stealer and exfiltration tool designed to harvest a wide range of sensitive information from the user’s system, including credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, and then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads. Its activities, such as decrypting stored credentials, silently killing processes, and hiding data collection methods, confirm malicious intent with high confidence.",
