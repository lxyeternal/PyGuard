{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to automatically clone specific Git repositories, move files, and execute a program during package installation, potentially for persistence or malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (os.getlogin()), the Git URLs, and file system operations such as os.listdir() and os.rename().",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve os.makedirs(), git.Git().clone(), os.rename(), and os.startfile() which execute system commands, clone repositories, move files, and run executables.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables influences file paths. The code clones repositories from external URLs into system directories, moves files, and executes an EXE, creating source-to-sink paths that could lead to persistence or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The script clones repositories into startup folders, moves potentially malicious scripts, and executes an external executable during install, which are unusual behaviors. The use of environment variables for directory paths and direct execution of external files at install time are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the package setup process to perform system modifications: creating startup folders, cloning malicious repositories, moving scripts into startup, and executing an EXE file during installation. These actions aim to establish persistence on the system. The code uses environment variables to determine user directories, downloads content from external sources, and executes files without user consent. The actions are characteristic of malicious behavior, such as backdooring or persistent malware delivery, especially given the cloning of potentially malicious repositories and automatic execution of external programs.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent by creating persistence mechanisms, cloning external repositories into system startup folders, moving scripts, and executing potentially harmful files automatically during package installation. These behaviors are typical of malware seeking persistence and unauthorized control of the target system.",
