  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to clone repositories and copy files into startup folders for persistence, then runs an executable at startup.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), environment variables, git clone commands, os.listdir(), os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.startfile() executing a specific .exe, cloning repositories into startup directories, creating folders in startup paths",
  "flows": "Environment variables and login info are used to determine paths -> cloning repositories into startup folders -> moving files to startup -> executing an executable at startup",
  "anomalies": "Persistent creation of folders in startup directories, cloning potentially malicious repositories, moving Python scripts into startup, automatic execution of an .exe file on install, use of environment variables for login paths",
  "analysis": "The script modifies system startup folders to include malicious repositories and executables, enabling persistence. It clones repositories from external sources into startup folders, copies scripts into startup locations, and executes a specified .exe automatically. These behaviors are typical of persistence mechanisms used in malware. The code does not perform any user interaction and operates silently during installation, raising suspicion. No benign or legitimate purpose is evident; the operations are aligned with malicious persistence and potential backdoor setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by setting up persistence through cloning repositories and executing files on startup without user consent. It creates multiple startup entries, clones external repositories, and executes an executable silently, indicative of backdoor or malware activity.",
