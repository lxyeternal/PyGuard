  "flows": "Retrieve login name -> create directories -> clone repositories -> move files -> execute external .exe file",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories into startup folders, moving script files into startup directory, executing a .exe file during installation, hardcoded GitHub URLs, modifying startup folder contents",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the Windows startup folder by cloning repositories and copying executable files into it, which can lead to persistence mechanisms for malicious activity. The use of hardcoded URLs and moving files into startup directories without user consent indicates potentially malicious intent. The execution of an external executable (.exe) during installation further raises suspicion, as this can be used for persistence or malicious payloads. The script does not validate or sanitize inputs, and the actions are highly invasive, designed to persist or run code automatically on system startup, which is characteristic of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious behavior by creating persistent startup entries, cloning repositories from external sources, and executing external files without user consent. These actions are indicative of potential malware or malicious intent, such as establishing persistence or executing unauthorized code.",
