{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that clones repositories, creates folders, moves files, and executes a file upon installation, potentially to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), os.path.join(), git.Git().clone(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "git.Git().clone() (cloning external repositories), os.rename(), os.startfile() (executing a potentially malicious executable), environment variable modification (GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH)",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and filesystem access flows into cloning repositories and executing files; cloned repositories may contain malicious code executed via startfile.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories into startup directories, moving files into startup folders, executing an arbitrary executable during installation, and creating folders in startup paths are suspicious behaviors indicative of persistence mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to set environment variables, create folders in user startup directories, clone potentially malicious repositories, move script files, and run an executable file automatically. These behaviors can be used for persistence, executing malicious code, or establishing backdoors. The use of hardcoded repository URLs and the automatic execution of a downloaded executable are red flags for malicious intent. The code leverages standard libraries but combines them in a way that suggests an attempt to maintain persistence or execute unauthorized code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains behaviors typical of malware, including persistent setup via startup folder modifications, cloning external repositories, and executing potentially malicious binaries during installation. These actions indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent, possibly for backdoor or persistence mechanisms.",
