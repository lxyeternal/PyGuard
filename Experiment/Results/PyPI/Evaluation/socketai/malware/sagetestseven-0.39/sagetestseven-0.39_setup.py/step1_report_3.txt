  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to clone repositories, create folders, move files, and execute an external executable, potentially for malicious persistence.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ, git.Git().clone(), os.listdir(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs(), os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() → folder creation and file movement; git clone → cloned repositories in startup directories; os.startfile() → executing an external .exe file",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories into startup folders, moving files into startup directories, executing external executable during installation, creating folders with generic names, and modifying startup items without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes the install command to create startup folders, clone malicious-looking repositories into those folders, and execute a .exe file located within a cloned repository. This behavior indicates persistent setup mechanisms that could enable malicious activity such as establishing persistence, executing arbitrary code, and potentially executing harmful payloads. The code does not validate the source or purpose of the cloned repositories, nor does it inform the user, suggesting malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs actions characteristic of malware, including cloning repositories into startup folders, executing external files silently, and manipulating startup items for persistence. These actions are commonly associated with malicious activity aimed at compromising user systems without consent.",
