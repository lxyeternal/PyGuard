  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including establishing persistence via cloning repositories into startup folders, executing external binaries, and manipulating user directories without consent. It is highly likely to be malware intended for system compromise or remote control. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend setting malware and security risk scores to 1 to reflect the high severity."
