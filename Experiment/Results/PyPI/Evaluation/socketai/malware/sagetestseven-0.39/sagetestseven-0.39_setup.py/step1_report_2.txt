  "purpose": "Custom installation process that clones malicious repositories, moves files, and executes an external executable to potentially establish persistence on a Windows system.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), os.rename(), git.Git().clone(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.startfile() executing a downloaded executable, cloning repositories to startup directories, moving files into startup folders",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and OS functions flows into directory creation and file movement, culminating in executing a potentially malicious .exe file on startup",
  "anomalies": "Cloning suspicious repositories into startup folders, moving scripts into startup, executing external executable at install time, no user consent prompts, hidden file operations in startup directories",
  "analysis": "The code begins by setting environment variables and cloning two repositories into the Windows startup directories, potentially to establish persistence. It then moves a script from a cloned directory to a startup folder, effectively configuring a script to run at system startup. Finally, it executes a downloaded .exe file, likely malicious, without user interaction or safeguards. These behaviors are characteristic of malware designed to persist and execute malicious code silently on victim systems.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs unauthorized cloning of repositories into startup folders and executes an external executable without user consent, indicating malicious intent. It appears designed to establish persistence and execute malicious payloads on Windows startup. The overall security risk is high.",
