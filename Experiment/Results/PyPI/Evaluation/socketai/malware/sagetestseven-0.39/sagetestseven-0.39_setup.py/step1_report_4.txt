  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to clone potentially malicious repositories and execute files from user directories, potentially enabling persistence and remote control.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), git.Git().clone(), os.startfile()",
  "sinks": "os.rename(), os.startfile()",
  "flows": "os.getlogin() -> os.makedirs()/clone files -> os.rename() -> os.startfile()",
  "anomalies": "Cloning repositories into startup folders, moving scripts, executing an executable during installation, modifying startup programs without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to set environment variables, clone two repositories from GitHub into startup-related directories, move a Python script into startup, and execute a binary file during setup. These actions suggest persistence mechanisms and potential for executing malicious code without user awareness. The code uses system directories and manipulates files, which are common behaviors in malware designed for persistence and remote control. The repositories cloned may contain malicious code; the execution of 'main.exe' is suspicious, especially in a setup context. There are no input validation or security checks, and the code does not log or alert the user, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malware, including cloning repositories into startup folders, executing files at install time, and manipulating user directories to establish persistence. These actions pose significant security risks and suggest malicious intent.",
