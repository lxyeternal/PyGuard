  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to clone specific repositories and move scripts/executables to system startup folders for persistent execution.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.listdir(), git.Git().clone() calls, environment variables, and file operations (os.makedirs, os.rename, os.startfile).",
  "sinks": "os.startfile() executing a specific executable, file renaming/moving operations, git cloning into startup directories.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and filesystem → cloning repositories and moving files → executing a file at startup.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning external repositories directly into startup folders, moving script files into startup directories, executing an executable at install time, use of environment variables for user-specific paths.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies system startup behavior by cloning remote repositories into startup directories and moving scripts to enable persistent execution of potentially malicious scripts/executables. It clones repositories from known URLs into startup folders, which can be used to run arbitrary code on system startup. It executes a specific executable without user consent. The use of environment variables to determine user paths and direct file operations indicates an intent to persist malicious code or scripts stealthily. No obfuscated code or hidden techniques are present; however, the behavior of installing and executing external code automatically is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively manipulates system startup directories to execute external scripts and executables fetched from remote sources, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. It could be used for persistence, remote code execution, or malware delivery. The actions performed are highly suspicious and dangerous for system integrity.",
