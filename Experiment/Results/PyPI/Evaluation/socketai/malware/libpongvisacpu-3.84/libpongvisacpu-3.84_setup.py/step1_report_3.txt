{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package called 'libpongvisacpu' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (os.path.exists), executes a subprocess command (subprocess.Popen), and imports setup from distutils.core.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen command potentially executes encoded PowerShell commands that can perform malicious actions; reading from filesystem is benign; setup parameters are standard.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess, which could be malicious; otherwise, it proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encoded PowerShell command that is executed with no validation, which is unusual and suspicious. The command is encoded and hidden, a common obfuscation tactic.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup for package configuration. It then attempts to import subprocess and os. If a specific file 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64. This command, when decoded, appears to connect to an external domain ('esquelesquad.rip') and possibly executes further malicious code. The setup function is standard for packaging but is encapsulated in a try-except block, which suppresses errors. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell code that runs conditionally indicates malicious intent, likely a backdoor or payload delivery mechanism. No other suspicious behaviors are observed within the setup configuration itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell payload triggered if a specific file does not exist, which is highly suspicious and indicates malicious behavior. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the embedded command is a significant security concern.",
