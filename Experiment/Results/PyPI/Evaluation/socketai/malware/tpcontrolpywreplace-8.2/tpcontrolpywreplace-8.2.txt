      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation, external URL, and conditional execution point to potential malware delivery or backdoor activity. The scores and assessments are justified; further decoding of the payload is recommended before deployment."
