{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user information, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, and send this data to an external webhook. It also searches local storage and browser data for credentials and cryptocurrency wallet info, then zips and uploads found files.",
  "sources": "Reads input or data from environment variables, local browser storage files, login databases, cookies, and log files; reads user directories for files; collects tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal data.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook; uploads files to anonfiles and transfer.sh; executes system commands to kill processes and zip files.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens/passwords/cookies from local files -> decrypts data -> compiles user info -> sends to webhook via LoadUrlib or LoadRequests functions -> uploads files and collects information from browser/discord directories.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated or overly complex regex patterns; forcibly installs missing modules without user consent; executes system commands like 'taskkill'; copies and decrypts sensitive data from local databases; includes hardcoded webhook URL; performs repeated network requests with retries; does not sanitize or validate data; references unusual file paths; contains functions with misleading or generic names.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules, some of which are injected dynamically. It establishes a webhook URL for exfiltration. It contains functions for decrypting Windows stored data, obtaining IP address, collecting Discord tokens and user info, and uploading data/files. The script searches browser profiles, Discord storage, and other application data directories for credentials and sensitive files. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows APIs and local encryption keys. It then compiles all collected data, creates zip archives of specific directories/files, and uploads them to external servers, reporting success via webhook. The code uses threading to perform concurrent data collection. It also includes functions to scan user directories for potentially sensitive files matching certain keywords, then uploads or reports these. The presence of hardcoded URLs, system commands to kill processes, decryption routines, and extensive data collection indicate malicious intent. The code is obfuscated by complex regex and indirect variable assignments, further supporting suspicion of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a malicious data stealer designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data—including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files—using various system and browser data sources. It communicates with external servers via webhooks and file uploads, indicating clear malicious intent. Its obfuscation and aggressive data collection confirm a high malware risk.",
