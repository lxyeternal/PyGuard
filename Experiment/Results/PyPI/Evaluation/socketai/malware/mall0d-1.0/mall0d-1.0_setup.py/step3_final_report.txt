{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a highly malicious information stealer, designed to extract Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and personal files, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook and upload files to external anonymous hosts.",
  "sources": "Local browser profile files (e.g., Login Data, Cookies, Local State), log files, environment variables, user directories, and system directories related to browsers and applications.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent through a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, uploaded to anonymous file hosting services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), and system commands (e.g., process termination).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files and system memory, decrypted using Windows API calls, compiled into messages or files, then transmitted over network requests or uploaded to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of exec(''), dynamic module installation via subprocess, threading for parallel operations, hardcoded webhook URL, use of obfuscated regex patterns, redundant imports, and misleading variable/function names indicating obfuscation and stealth.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits extensive malicious behaviors: it decrypts stored credentials, harvests tokens, cookies, and passwords, collects system info, and exfiltrates data stealthily. It employs obfuscation techniques such as complex regex, redundant imports, and dynamic code execution. It also terminates browser processes to avoid detection. These behaviors are consistent with a comprehensive info-stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is unequivocally malicious, designed for large-scale data theft and exfiltration, with multiple stealth and obfuscation techniques. It poses a severe security threat, justifying maximum malware and risk scores.",
