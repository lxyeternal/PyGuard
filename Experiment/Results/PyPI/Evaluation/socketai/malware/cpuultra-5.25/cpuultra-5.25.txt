      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, indicative of malicious activity such as backdoors or payload delivery. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as compromised until the payload is decoded and verified."
