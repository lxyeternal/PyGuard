{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, likely for malicious purposes such as payload delivery or backdoor installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen call executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "PowerShell process execution with encoded command; silent, hidden process creation",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; encoded command executed silently in background",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; conditional execution based on filesystem state",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check for 'tahg' and, if absent, runs a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is suspicious due to obfuscation and stealth. The setup() call appears standard but is wrapped in broad exception handling, concealing errors. The encoded command's purpose is unknown but likely malicious, given the context. The pattern aligns with common supply chain attack tactics involving obfuscated payloads. Scores across reports are consistent, with high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.8-0.9), and security risk (0.75-0.85), reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, indicative of malicious activity such as backdoors or payload delivery. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as compromised until the payload is decoded and verified.",
