      "conclusion": "The code exhibits confirmed malicious behavior through remote code download and execution, process launching, and obfuscation. It poses a high security threat and should be flagged as malware. The embedded remote code fetch and execution are classic indicators of malicious activity, justifying maximum malware and security risk scores."
