  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious intent such as backdoors or data theft. The silent error handling and obfuscation further suggest malicious activity. The setup code is benign, but the embedded payload warrants high suspicion and further analysis. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and justified. This package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until the payload is decoded and verified."
