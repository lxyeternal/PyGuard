  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'aowdjpawojd'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools', defines version, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code installs dependencies but does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only specifies dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, specifying package dependencies and version. No code execution, data input, or network activity occurs here. The dependencies listed include popular libraries such as 'requests', 'discordwebhook', 'browser_cookie3', and 'robloxpy', which are common in various applications. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The empty author fields are unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the script appears safe.",
