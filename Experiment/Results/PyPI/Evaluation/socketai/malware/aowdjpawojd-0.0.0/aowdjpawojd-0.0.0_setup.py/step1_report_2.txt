  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it primarily defines static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or security vulnerabilities from data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup with name, version, author info, packages, and dependencies. All dependencies are common Python packages. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious code is present. The dependencies are publicly available and do not inherently suggest malicious intent. The code is minimal, straightforward, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The absence of author info may be unusual but is not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and typical for Python package configuration.",
