      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk malicious payload embedded within the setup process, executed silently and obfuscated to evade detection. The suspicious URL and the use of encoded PowerShell commands strongly suggest malicious activity, such as remote command execution or backdoor installation. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered dangerous to install."
