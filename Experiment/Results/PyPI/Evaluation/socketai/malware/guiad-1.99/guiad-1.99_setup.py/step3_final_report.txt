  "purpose": "Detect malicious activity or sabotage in the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for 'tahg' directory; the obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed with -EncodedCommand; silent execution hides activity; potential data exfiltration or payload download.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, run obfuscated PowerShell command silently -> command executes in background, potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command run silently; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; conditional execution based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, which is suspicious. The command is encoded, run with hidden window flags, and conditioned on a filesystem check, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Error suppression further hides failures. Scores of malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9) are justified given these behaviors. Without decoding the payload, malicious intent cannot be confirmed definitively, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating likely malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious behavior.",
