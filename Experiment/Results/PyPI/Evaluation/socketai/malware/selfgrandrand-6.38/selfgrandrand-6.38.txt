      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package installation, likely malicious. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and suspicious comment indicate malicious intent, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The broad exception handling further conceals potential failures. Overall, this package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged accordingly."
