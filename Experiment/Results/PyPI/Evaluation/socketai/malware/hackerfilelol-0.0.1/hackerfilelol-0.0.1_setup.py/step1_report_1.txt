{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and dependencies, but also downloads and executes a remote executable, which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL (Discord CDN) for downloading 'main.exe'; reading files such as 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt'; environment setup and package installation.",
  "sinks": "Writing to disk ('main.exe'), renaming and moving the downloaded executable to a disguised system folder, executing the downloaded executable via os.startfile.",
  "flows": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL, saves it locally, moves it to a disguised Windows folder, then runs it, potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "The folder name '$Windows.~SXK' is hidden and disguises malicious activity; the code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL; renaming and executing downloaded files in a stealthy manner; presence of hardcoded paths and suspicious package name 'hackerfilelol'.",
  "analysis": "The initial part of the code defines a Python package setup with standard fields, which by itself is not malicious. However, the latter part performs suspicious activities: creating a hidden directory, downloading an executable from a Discord CDN URL, renaming it to mimic a system folder, and executing it silently. This pattern indicates intent to deploy and run potentially malicious software covertly. The code's structure suggests an attempt to disguise malicious actions as a legitimate package setup, but the core activity of remote code execution is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable covertly, likely intended for malicious purposes. The disguise via package setup and hidden folder enhances its malicious intent. Overall, the code is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
