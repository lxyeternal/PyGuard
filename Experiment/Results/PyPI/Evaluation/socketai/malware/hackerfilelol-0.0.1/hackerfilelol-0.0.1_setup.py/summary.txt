  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior through remote payload download, stealthy file placement, and execution. The high malware score (1.0) and security risk score (1.0) are justified. The code is not obfuscated, but its actions pose a severe threat, warranting immediate caution and potential removal from supply chains."
