      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior through remote payload download, stealthy file placement, and execution. The high malware score (1.0) and security risk score (1.0) are justified. The code is not obfuscated, but its actions pose a severe threat, warranting immediate caution and potential removal from supply chains."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including external payload download, concealment, and execution without validation. It should be classified as highly malicious with a very high security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
