{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, primarily for installing dependencies and possibly executing hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, and the embedded encrypted data in the code for decryption; data is fetched from the internet via 'requests' when run on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include executing decrypted code via 'exec' and network requests that may send or receive data, or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from encrypted string in Fernet decryption, potentially fetched or executed code flows into 'exec' during installation, with network activity triggered on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed via 'exec' during install, which is suspicious. The encrypted data is hardcoded and decrypted only on Windows. The package name is misspelled ('requiurement'). The code uses obscure variable names, and the 'exec' call decrypts and runs code dynamically, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard libraries but includes a custom 'install' class that overrides the 'run' method. On Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an embedded encrypted string and executes the resulting code with 'exec'. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity such as executing hidden code during installation. The encrypted payload could contain malicious instructions, and the dynamic code execution without clear intent is a security concern. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious code execution during package installation, which aligns with supply chain attack patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior with encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, indicating potential malicious intent. The obfuscated and hidden code execution, especially triggered only on Windows, poses a security risk. The package should be considered unsafe until further analysis confirms its purpose, as it exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks.",
