  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing decrypted code which may run arbitrary code on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes embedded code.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload decrypted and executed at install time, which is unusual and suspicious. Use of obfuscated variable names and long, meaningless strings suggests concealment. The code downloads and executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but contains a malicious payload: during Windows installation, it decrypts and executes code fetched or embedded within the package. The encrypted string and its decryption indicate intentional concealment. The code's purpose appears to be executing arbitrary code on Windows systems, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The package name and description are nonsensical, further indicating obfuscation. The use of 'exec' with decrypted code is a major security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows. The obfuscated code and the execution of decrypted content indicate an intent to run malicious code. Overall, the package is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
