  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with custom installation behavior that includes executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from os (for os.name), imports modules requests and fernet during runtime, and decrypts embedded encrypted strings.",
  "sinks": "The code executes decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary malicious code if the decryption key or encrypted payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes embedded code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload decrypted at install time and executed via exec(), which is highly unusual and suspicious. The encrypted strings are hardcoded and appear arbitrary; the encrypted data could conceal malicious code. The package name 'requiurement' is a misspelling, possibly obfuscation. Use of encrypted execution indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package setup with a custom install command that, on Windows systems, dynamically imports requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts an embedded encrypted payload with a hardcoded key and executes it via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during installation. The encrypted payload may contain malicious code or backdoors. The code's structure and obfuscation (encrypted data, unusual package name) suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The presence of 'exec' on decrypted data and the use of encryption to conceal code are typical malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains suspicious behavior, notably the execution of decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. This is indicative of potential malicious activity or backdoor, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. The encrypted payload and obfuscated code strongly suggest malicious intent.",
