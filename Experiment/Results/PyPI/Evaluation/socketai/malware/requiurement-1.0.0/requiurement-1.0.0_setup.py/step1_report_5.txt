  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom install command which executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, decrypting and executing code within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() within the install process, which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> Custom install class run method -> Decrypts data -> Executes code with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload executed via exec() during installation, hardcoded encrypted data, nonsensical package metadata, suspicious code decryption and execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, during installation on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet modules. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the resulting code via exec(). The payload is encrypted, which indicates an attempt to obfuscate malicious code. The code runs during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. The package metadata (name, description, etc.) appears nonsensical and may be intentionally misleading. The overall structure suggests the package is designed to decrypt and run potentially malicious code during install, posing a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains encrypted payload execution during installation, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The use of exec() on decrypted data during setup indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The package should not be used.",
