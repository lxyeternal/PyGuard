  "conclusion": "The code exhibits definitive malicious behavior, including remote payload download, execution, and persistence mechanisms. The malicious activity is explicit, and the code's structure supports a supply chain attack vector. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 1, high security risk—are justified and consistent with the analysis."
