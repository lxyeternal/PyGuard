{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define simple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with multiple similar function definitions, likely for basic calculations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could be exploited or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are straightforward mathematical operations with internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are numerous coding errors: repeated parameter names (n1), inconsistent parameter naming, and functions that are essentially duplicates with different names. No external dependencies or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions intended for addition and subtraction but has multiple issues such as reusing the same parameter name 'n1' multiple times, which would cause syntax errors. The functions do not perform any malicious actions, contain no input/output or external data handling, and lack any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The presence of comments or signatures suggests an attempt at simple arithmetic operations without malicious intent. Overall, the code is rudimentary and error-prone but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a flawed implementation of basic arithmetic functions with no malicious intent or malicious patterns. The primary concern is code correctness rather than security.",
