{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define basic arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with multiple similarly named functions, possibly for simple calculations or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "There are no external data sources, inputs, or environment variables read by the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, system modification, or other effects.",
  "flows": "The functions operate independently and do not interact with external data or systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains repeated functions with inconsistent parameter naming (n1 vs n2), and the parameter names are duplicated (n1: int, n1: int) which is syntactically invalid in Python, indicating possible obfuscation or poor code quality. The functions do not seem to serve meaningful purpose beyond simple arithmetic, and there is no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for addition and subtraction with inconsistent and duplicate parameter names, suggesting either obfuscation or poorly written code. No external inputs are read, and no data is sent to external systems. The code does not include any malicious actions such as network communication, file manipulation, or environment variable access. The duplicated function names and parameters indicate a lack of correctness or intentional obfuscation, but no malicious intent is evident. The initial comment appears to reference some group or website but does not impact the code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely harmless and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It seems to be either poorly written or intentionally obfuscated, but there are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious activities. The main concern is the syntactical inconsistency that would prevent execution, suggesting it may be incomplete or intentionally obfuscated.",
