{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several simple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with similar naming patterns.",
  "sources": "No data input sources, external data, or user input are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks, command executions, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are straightforward calculations with local variables.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are inconsistently named (n1 repeated multiple times), and there are duplicate function definitions with similar names and parameters. The code contains no input validation, external calls, or data handling that might indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple arithmetic functions (suma, resta, etc.) with inconsistent parameter naming (all named n1), which suggests a lack of clarity rather than malicious intent. The functions are simple and do not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The initial comment includes an ambiguous phrase and a website reference, but no code-based malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward, possibly poorly written, set of utility functions without malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malware or malicious behavior. It is a set of simple arithmetic functions with no external interactions or security risks. The unusual naming and duplicate functions are likely coding oversights rather than malicious sabotage.",
