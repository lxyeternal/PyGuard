{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with inconsistent and flawed parameter naming, containing syntax errors and references to undefined variables, indicating incomplete or poorly written code.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., n1, n2), but due to errors, no reliable data sources are identified.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No meaningful data flow from sources to sinks; code is flawed and does not execute correctly.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated parameter names ('n1'), references to undefined variables ('n2'), inconsistent naming conventions, syntax errors, and incomplete functions suggest obfuscation or careless coding.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions for basic arithmetic operations with duplicate parameter names, leading to syntax errors. Some functions reference undefined variables, indicating incomplete or placeholder code. There are no external data interactions, network activity, or malicious payloads. The comments referencing 'Tahg && EsqueleSquad' appear to be signatures or attributions, not malicious markers. The inconsistent naming and errors suggest poor coding practices or intentional obfuscation, but no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The overall structure and signals do not align with malicious supply chain attacks or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is flawed, incomplete, and poorly written, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The suspicious signatures are likely attribution rather than indicators of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
