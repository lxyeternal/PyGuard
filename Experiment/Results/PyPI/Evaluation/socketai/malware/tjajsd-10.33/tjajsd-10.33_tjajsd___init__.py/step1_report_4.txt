{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define basic arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with multiple variants, likely for use as utility functions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading detected; functions accept parameters but do not read from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations detected within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; functions simply perform arithmetic operations on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple functions named similarly with inconsistent parameter names (n1, n1), repeated code blocks, and a lack of meaningful logic or usage context. The code contains undefined variables (n2) used within functions, which indicates errors or placeholders. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for addition and subtraction, but all functions reference an undefined variable 'n2' instead of the parameters 'n1' and 'n2'. Parameter naming is inconsistent, and some functions have duplicated parameter names. No input reading, external data access, or output functions are present. The code appears to be incomplete or incorrectly written, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent evident. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malware activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of straightforward arithmetic functions with significant errors (use of undefined variables), but no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. It seems to be a faulty or placeholder implementation rather than malicious code.",
