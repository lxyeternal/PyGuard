{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define multiple simple arithmetic functions, primarily addition and subtraction, with inconsistent naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the functions (n1, n2) - although the functions are misnamed and contain errors.",
  "sinks": "Return statements within the functions; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Function input parameters (n1, n2) flow directly to return expressions, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "1. The functions have inconsistent and incorrect parameter naming (n1 repeatedly used instead of n2). 2. All functions are simple arithmetic, with no external data or network interactions. 3. The code contains a comment that appears to be a signature or attribution. 4. No input validation or security controls are present, but this alone is not malicious. 5. The comment mentions 'Tahg && EsqueleSquad', which seems unrelated to functionality and possibly suspicious if taken out of context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions intended for basic arithmetic operations, but the functions are improperly written: parameter names are duplicated ('n1' used twice), which would cause runtime errors. The functions perform simple addition and subtraction and do not process untrusted data or interact with external systems. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows. The comment at the beginning may indicate an attribution or group but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be an incomplete or improperly formatted set of basic math functions with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious activity or malware. It is poorly structured and contains syntax errors, but no indicators of malicious behavior, data theft, backdoors, or external communications. It likely results from incomplete or incorrect code development rather than an intent to harm.",
