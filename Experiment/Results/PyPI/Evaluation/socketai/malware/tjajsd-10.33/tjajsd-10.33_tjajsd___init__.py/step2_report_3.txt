  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code correctness, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are simple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction), with multiple similar functions.\n- Many functions contain parameter naming errors (e.g., repeated 'n1' instead of 'n2'), which would cause syntax errors in Python.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is evident.\n- The comments and signatures seem to be just attribution or branding, not malicious.\n- The code appears to be either incomplete, poorly written, or obfuscated, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Basic arithmetic functions, but with multiple similar functions.\n- **Errors:** Repeated parameter names ('n1' used multiple times), which would cause syntax errors.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just flawed code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — seems reasonable given the errors but no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as non-malicious, mainly flawed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, with inconsistent naming.\n- **Errors:** Same as above, plus mention of a comment that seems unrelated.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; syntax errors present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.3, Risk = 0.2 — the obfuscated score is slightly high considering the code's simplicity and errors.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly notes the lack of malicious activity but suggests some obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The obfuscated score might be slightly high; I would suggest lowering it to 0.2 or 0.1, aligning with the low malicious potential.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar functions, with mention of obfuscation.\n- **Errors:** Duplicate parameter names, inconsistent naming, possible obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious actions; code errors dominate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.3, Risk = 0.1 — seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as not malicious but possibly obfuscated.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Basic arithmetic functions, but with undefined variables ('n2') used.\n- **Errors:** Use of undefined variables, inconsistent parameter naming.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; code appears incomplete or incorrect.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 — accurate, as no obfuscation or malware is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar functions, no external data.\n- **Errors:** Repeated variable names, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; code is flawed but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but acceptable considering the poor code quality.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Some reports assign a small value (0.3), citing code obfuscation or poor quality. Given the code's simplicity and errors, a lower obfuscated score (around 0.1-0.2) might be more appropriate, but the current scores are not unreasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Very low across all reports, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimate:\n\nConsidering the code's nature, errors, and lack of malicious activity, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting poor code quality but no malicious intent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1, as the code is flawed but not dangerous.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0.1          | 0.1    |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.2    |\n| 3       | 0       | 0.2          | 0.1    |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.0    |\n| 5       | 0       | 0.1          | 0.1    |\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious. The obfuscation scores could be slightly lowered, but overall, the assessments are reasonable. No evidence suggests any supply chain or malware risk in this code snippet.",
