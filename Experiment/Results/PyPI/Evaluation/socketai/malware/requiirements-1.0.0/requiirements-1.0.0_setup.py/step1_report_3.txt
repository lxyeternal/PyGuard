  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with conditional execution of encrypted code during installation on Windows.",
  "sources": "Imports os, requests, fernet; Reads environment variable os.name; Executes decrypted code via exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() call with decrypted content, potentially executing malicious code",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypts and executes code via exec() if on Windows",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload with Fernet that executes code at install time, especially within a setup script. The decrypted code is not visible, but its execution poses risk.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup with metadata. Notably, during installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload using exec() with a Fernet key. The decrypted code could be malicious, as exec() can run arbitrary code. The use of encrypted code in a setup process is suspicious, as it may hide malicious payloads intended to run upon installation. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate. No other malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are apparent outside this exec() call.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk encrypted payload executed during installation on Windows systems. This behavior suggests potential malicious intent, as it can run arbitrary code at install time. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the encrypted exec() is suspicious and warrants caution.",
