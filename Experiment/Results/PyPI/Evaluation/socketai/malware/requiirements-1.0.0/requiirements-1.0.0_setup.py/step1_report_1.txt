{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes remote code via Fernet encryption.",
  "sources": "os.name check, Fernet decryption key and cipher, import of requests and Fernet, exec() call",
  "sinks": "exec() of decrypted code potentially obtained from remote source",
  "flows": "os.name -> requests/Fernet import -> Fernet decryption -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted remote payload, hardcoded Fernet key, decryption and execution conditioned only on Windows OS",
  "analysis": "The code verifies if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is executed directly via exec(), which can run malicious code. The Fernet key and encrypted data are embedded directly in the code, indicating potential malicious intent. The code’s primary function appears to be to fetch and execute code from an external source covertly, especially on Windows systems. The setup configuration also contains obfuscated or meaningless description fields, possibly to conceal malicious intent or evade detection. No benign functionality justifies remote code execution without explicit user consent or validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code likely contains malicious behavior, specifically executing remotely decrypted code during installation on Windows. The use of hardcoded encryption keys, conditional execution, and exec() points to an intent to conceal and run arbitrary code, representing a significant security risk.",
