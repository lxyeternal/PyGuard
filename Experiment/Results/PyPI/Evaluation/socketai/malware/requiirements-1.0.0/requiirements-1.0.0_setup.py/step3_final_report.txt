{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a decrypted payload during installation on Windows systems, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded encrypted payload and Fernet key within the install class, and conditionally imports modules during setup.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or remote control.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts the hardcoded payload with the embedded Fernet key, then executes it via exec() during the run() method of the custom install class, only on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encrypted payload and key, use of exec() on decrypted data, conditional execution only on Windows, nonsensical descriptions, and obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install command that, on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and key are embedded directly, indicating malicious intent. The use of exec() on decrypted code allows arbitrary code execution, which is a common malware tactic. The code's obfuscation and conditional execution further suggest malicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given these indicators. No logical errors or unwarranted assumptions are present; the analysis aligns with standard security assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, executing encrypted payloads during installation on Windows, which can lead to system compromise. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
