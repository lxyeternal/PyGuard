  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code indeed contains a custom `install` class that, on Windows (`os.name == \"nt\"`), imports `requests` and `Fernet`, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes it via `exec()`.\n   - The setup configuration uses this custom class in the `cmdclass` parameter, meaning this code runs during package installation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the use of `exec()` on decrypted remote code, the presence of hardcoded encryption keys, and the conditional execution on Windows.\n   - They note the encrypted payload and the suspicious obfuscation.\n   - No logical errors are apparent in the reports; they accurately describe the malicious pattern.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign high malware scores (~0.85–0.9), which is justified given the code's behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are similarly high (~0.8–0.9), consistent with executing arbitrary code during setup.\n   - Obfuscation scores (~0.8–0.9) are reasonable due to encrypted payloads and nonsensical descriptions.\n   - The confidence levels (~0.9) are appropriate given the clarity of malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Justification for High Risk Scores (>0.5)**:\n   - The code decrypts and executes arbitrary code at install time, which is a severe security concern.\n   - The use of hardcoded keys and encrypted payloads suggests malicious intent.\n   - The code could be used to run remote or malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise systems.\n   - Therefore, scores above 0.5 are justified and align with standard security assessment practices.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware scores (~0.85–0.9) are justified by the presence of:\n     - Remote code execution (`exec()` of decrypted payload)\n     - Encrypted payload hiding malicious intent\n     - Conditional execution on Windows, potentially to target specific environments\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on concrete evidence: encrypted payload, use of `exec()`, hardcoded keys, and conditional execution.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating high malicious potential.\n   - No contradictions or unreasonable score adjustments are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.** It contains encrypted payloads that are decrypted and executed during package installation, which is a classic indicator of malicious backdoors or remote code execution vectors.\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware       | **0.9**           | Decrypting and executing remote code during setup is very dangerous and typical of malware. |\n| Obfuscated    | **0.9**           | Encrypted payloads, nonsensical descriptions, and obfuscated variable names indicate high obfuscation. |\n| Risk          | **0.95**          | The behavior poses an immediate and severe security threat, warranting a very high risk score. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe package contains embedded malicious behavior designed to run arbitrary code during installation, especially on Windows systems. It should be flagged as malicious, and usage should be avoided.",
