      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, conditioned on filesystem state, with comments and execution methods indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL comment all point toward malicious activity, likely a supply chain attack or backdoor. The scores across reports are consistent and justified, warranting further analysis of the payload and cautious handling."
