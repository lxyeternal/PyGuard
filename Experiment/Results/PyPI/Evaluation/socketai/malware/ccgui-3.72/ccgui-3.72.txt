      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicative of malicious behavior such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified by the evidence. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis of the decoded command confirms its intent."
