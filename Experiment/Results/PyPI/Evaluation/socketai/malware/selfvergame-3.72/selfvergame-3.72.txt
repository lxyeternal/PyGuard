      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, which could be malicious. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and external contact points justify a high malware and security risk score. The package should be considered potentially malicious and avoided until further decoding and analysis of the payload."
