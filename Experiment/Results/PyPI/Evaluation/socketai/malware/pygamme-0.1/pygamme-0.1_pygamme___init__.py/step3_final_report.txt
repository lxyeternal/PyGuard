  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules like os, sys, reads environment variables, user input, external libraries, or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, user input, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions; no malicious sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets are either minimal or absent, with descriptions indicating benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the lack of malicious indicators. Risk scores of 0.2 reflect cautious acknowledgment of environmental data handling but are appropriate given the benign context. Confidence levels are justified based on the limited information. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary; the overall assessment indicates a safe supply chain posture.",
