  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script, likely for a utility or application, but no specific intent can be inferred from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input() calls, reads environment variables, and imports external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but no explicit risky actions are identified in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows into processing functions, but no clear dangerous data flow to sensitive actions is evident from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are detected. The code appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, reads input from the user, and possibly uses environment variables. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as network exfiltration or system manipulation. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation features are present. Without additional context, it appears to be a benign script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a standard, non-malicious utility script with no malicious intent detected.",
