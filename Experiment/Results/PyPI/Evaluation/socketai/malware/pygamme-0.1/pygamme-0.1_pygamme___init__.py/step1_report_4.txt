  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and minimal context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from user input, environment variables, or external files (if present). Exact sources are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over network connections if present. No explicit sinks are visible in the current code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, then potentially to output or network sinks, but explicit flows are not identifiable from the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are visible. The code uses standard libraries and constructs, with no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain any obvious malicious constructs. There are no signs of suspicious behavior such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or code injection. Without further context or additional code, the analysis cannot identify malicious intent. The lack of comments or documentation makes it difficult to fully understand the purpose, but no malicious or suspicious patterns are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. However, due to limited information, confidence is moderate.",
