  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, environment variables, imported libraries, file and network operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across reports show no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Input sources are typical, and sinks involve standard operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed. Confidence in benign intent is high (0.9). The lack of malicious indicators justifies malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0. The security risk score of 0.2 is conservative but acceptable given the minimal code and context. Overall, the code appears safe with no evident security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
