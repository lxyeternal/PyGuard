  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility or script, potentially for data processing or interaction with external systems, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to the lack of context and the code not being provided.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input, environment variables, or external files, if present. Specific sources cannot be identified without the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing commands based on untrusted data. Specific sinks cannot be pinpointed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, filesystem, command execution). Due to missing code, precise flows are not determinable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code snippet. If there were hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs, they would be noted here.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided for detailed analysis. Cannot identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies without actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious intent or security risks without the code. Please provide the code snippet for a thorough review.",
