{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits collected data to an external server, acting as a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (hostname, cwd, username) into the 'ploads' dictionary, which is then sent via requests.get() to the external URL during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a network request during setup without user notification, transmitting system info to a suspicious domain. The URL appears obfuscated or suspicious, and the data exfiltration occurs covertly during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation, indicating malicious exfiltration activity. The URL used is suspicious and possibly obfuscated, aligning with malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code, but the behavior is clearly malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation low) are consistent with this activity. The activity can compromise user privacy and system security, justifying high severity scores. The logic is sound, and the malicious intent is evident from the code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious exfiltration behavior during package installation, transmitting user and system data to a suspicious external URL. The activity is straightforward and malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The reports accurately identify this behavior, and the scores are appropriate. The primary concern is privacy invasion and potential supply chain sabotage.",
