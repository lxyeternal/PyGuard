{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to an external URL with collected system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code gathers hostname, cwd, and username, then transmits this data to an external server via requests.get() call.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request during installation that transmits system information without user consent or notification. The URL is suspiciously obfuscated and appears to be malicious or at least intended for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package installation. It subclasses the install command to execute additional code during installation. This custom run method gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then makes an HTTP request to a hardcoded external URL, potentially for data exfiltration or tracking. No validation or user notification is present. The URL is obfuscated, indicating malicious intent. The code leverages common system libraries for information gathering but uses requests to send data covertly during package install, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating a potential supply chain attack or tracking mechanism. The obfuscated URL and data transmission during install are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
