{
  "purpose": "To customize the installation process by executing additional code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'requests.get' call within the CustomInstall class's run method, which executes during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call transmits system information (hostname, current directory, username) to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, system data is collected and sent to an external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com) via an HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system details to an external server during package installation without user consent, and the URL used appears suspicious or intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when executed, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain. This behavior resembles a data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity, potentially malicious. The use of a hardcoded URL and automatic data transmission during setup indicates malicious intent or security risk. No other malicious or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by transmitting system information to an external server during installation, which could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or data theft. This code is malicious or highly suspicious and should be avoided.",
