{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom installation command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call transmits collected system data to a remote URL, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system functions (sources) during installation and sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded URL that appears suspicious and is used for exfiltrating system information without user consent. The URL appears obfuscated or intentionally hidden, and the code silently sends data during installation without warning.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup. It customizes the install command to gather hostname, current working directory, and username. These data are then sent via a GET request to an external URL, which is suspicious behavior, especially during package installation. There is no user notification or consent, and the URL looks obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate user system information. The code is straightforward but purposefully designed to collect and transmit data covertly, which is typical of malicious or unwanted surveillance activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. The remote URL and data transmission strongly suggest a security breach or privacy violation. The package should be considered unsafe for installation.",
