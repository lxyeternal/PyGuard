{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation command that sends system information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser() (collects hostname, current working directory, and username); requests.get() (sends data to remote URL)",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending system information to a remote server",
  "flows": "During installation, CustomInstall.run() gathers hostname, cwd, username, and sends this data via HTTP GET to an external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent; the URL is suspicious; no comments indicating benign purpose; the URL may be malicious or tracking-oriented",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a custom install class inheriting from setuptools' install, and overrides the run() method. In run(), it executes the standard install, then collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It constructs a payload with these details and makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain, which is likely used for tracking or malicious exfiltration. This behavior is hidden within the setup script, and the remote server is not a known benign endpoint. No other malicious code or obfuscation is present. The code's primary malicious feature is the covert data transmission during installation, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user awareness, indicating a supply chain attack vector or privacy violation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but contains hidden malicious activity.",
