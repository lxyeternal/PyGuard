{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during the custom installation process.",
  "sinks": "Performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL with system data as parameters, potentially leaking user and system information.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into the requests.get call, which transmits this information externally.",
  "anomalies": "The requests.get call is used unconventionally during the package installation process to exfiltrate system data to an external domain. The URL is suspiciously obfuscated, and the data sent is minimal but could be used for fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional code during package installation. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server with a seemingly random domain. This behavior resembles a form of data exfiltration or device fingerprinting, which is unusual for a typical setup script and indicates potential malicious intent. No other malicious code, such as payload execution, code injection, or backdoors, is present. The external server domain is obfuscated, raising suspicion. The exfiltration occurs during installation, which could be considered malicious or at least intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. This exfiltration of data without user consent suggests a backdoor or tracking mechanism, making the package potentially dangerous for users.",
