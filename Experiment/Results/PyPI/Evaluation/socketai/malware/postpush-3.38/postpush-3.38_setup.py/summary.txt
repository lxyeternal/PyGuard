  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The current scores are justified, and the overall security risk is very high. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its purpose."
