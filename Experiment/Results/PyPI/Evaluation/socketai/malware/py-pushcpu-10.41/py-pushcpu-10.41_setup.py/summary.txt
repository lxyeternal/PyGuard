  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and embedded URL strongly suggest malicious activity. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend treating this package as high risk and conducting further decoding of the PowerShell command for definitive confirmation."
