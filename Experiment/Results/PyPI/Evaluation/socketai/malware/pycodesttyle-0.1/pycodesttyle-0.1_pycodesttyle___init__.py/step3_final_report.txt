{
  "purpose": "This report evaluates the security posture of the open source dependency based on available code analysis data.",
  "sources": "No code provided; therefore, no sources of input or data are identifiable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are detectable due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be established without code input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observable in the absence of code.",
  "analysis": "Given the reports explicitly state that no code was provided, no static or dynamic analysis can be performed. The scores assigned (confidence, obfuscated, malware, securityRisk) are all zero, which is appropriate because there is no evidence or data to suggest any malicious activity or obfuscation. The reports correctly avoid making unsupported claims and reflect the limitations imposed by the lack of code. The consistency across all reports indicates a correct understanding of the situation.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are accurate and appropriate given the absence of code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks can be inferred without code data. The current scores of zero across all metrics are justified and should be maintained until actual code is available for review.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
