  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. Presence of Issues:\n- All reports explicitly state that no code was provided.\n- Consequently, there are no identifiable sources, sinks, data flows, anomalies, or behaviors to analyze.\n- The conclusion across all reports is consistent: without code, no security risks or malicious behaviors can be determined.\n\n2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are logically sound given the absence of code. They correctly refrain from making assumptions or conclusions without code content.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident since they do not overreach their analysis.\n\n3. Score Justification:\n- All reports assign scores of 0 for confidence, obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n- These scores are appropriate because without code, there is no basis to assess any security issues or malicious intent.\n\n4. Malware and Risk Scores:\n- Since no code is provided, malware and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Any suggestion to increase these scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports avoid making unsupported claims about vulnerabilities or malicious activity, which is correct.\n- They acknowledge the lack of data and refrain from speculation.\n\n6. Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' content—no code means no detectable issues.\n\n**Summary and Recommendations:**\n- Given the absence of code, the assessments are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports correctly reflect the situation.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Final Note:**\n- If future reports include actual code, a detailed static and dynamic analysis should be performed to identify potential security issues.\n- For now, the current evaluations are accurate and justified.",
