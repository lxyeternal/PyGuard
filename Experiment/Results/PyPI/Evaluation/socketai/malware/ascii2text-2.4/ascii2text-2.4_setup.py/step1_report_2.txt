{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'ascii2text' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for package metadata such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the setup function uses predefined static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its 'setup' function with static metadata parameters to define a package. All data used is hardcoded as strings or lists, with no external input or dynamic execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The metadata appears typical for a Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
