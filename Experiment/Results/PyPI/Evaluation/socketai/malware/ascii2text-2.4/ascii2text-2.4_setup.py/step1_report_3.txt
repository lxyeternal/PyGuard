  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ascii2text'.",
  "sources": "The source of input data is the setup parameters provided within the code (name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, packages).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writing, or environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the data is static and used solely for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward package setup with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration. It specifies metadata for the package 'ascii2text' including version, license, author info, description, and packages. All data appears to be static, hardcoded, and typical for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, no external data input, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for publishing a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears safe based on this code fragment.",
