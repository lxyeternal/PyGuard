{
  "purpose": "To define the package metadata and configuration for distributing the 'ascii2text' Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read at runtime; all information is static within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks; no network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "The code flows only through static data assignments used by setuptools to package the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic are present. The author email appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata such as name, version, license, author, description, keywords, and packages. All data appears standard and typical for a Python package setup. No external inputs or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any dynamic or malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden code. It is a straightforward package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It simply defines metadata for distributing the package 'ascii2text'.",
