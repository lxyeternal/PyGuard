  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'ascii2text'.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with hardcoded, static metadata. No dynamic behavior, external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence in these assessments is high (1), given the static and standard structure of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is entirely benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
