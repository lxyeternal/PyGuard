  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'ascii2text'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: package name, version, license, author details, description, keywords, and package list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious constructs detected. All data is statically defined with no dynamic execution or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, calls setup() with static arguments specifying package metadata, and does not include any user input, external data sources, or suspicious code constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The content appears typical for a Python package distribution configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for publishing a Python package. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
