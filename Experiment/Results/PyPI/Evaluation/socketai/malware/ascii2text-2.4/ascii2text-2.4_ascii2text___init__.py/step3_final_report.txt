{
  "purpose": "The code downloads remote scripts and DLLs, overwrites local Python package files, and executes payloads, indicating malicious intent to compromise the system.",
  "sources": "Requesting scripts from external URLs, reading environment variables, and reading/writing files in TEMP directory.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded scripts via system calls, overwriting core Python files (__init__.py), and executing DLL payloads.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetches → writes to local files → executes via system → overwrites Python package files with remote content.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing code from suspicious domains, overwriting critical Python files, executing DLLs as payloads, platform-specific check for Windows only.",
  "analysis": "The code performs remote code fetches, overwrites system and Python environment files, and executes payloads, all on Windows. No validation or sandboxing is present. The URLs are suspicious, and the code's behavior aligns with typical malware activity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but actively malicious, with high potential for system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is unequivocally malicious, performing remote code execution, overwriting system files, and targeting Windows systems. The malware score should be set to 1, security risk to 1, and obfuscation to 0, reflecting its active malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
