  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating potential malicious intent. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression are red flags. Scores of malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified based on these indicators. The package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further payload decoding."
