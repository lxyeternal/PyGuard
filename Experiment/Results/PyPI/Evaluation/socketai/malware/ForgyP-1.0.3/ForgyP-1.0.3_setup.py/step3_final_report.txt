{
  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script using setuptools to package the 'ForgyP' project with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, url, license, author, author_email, description, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network activity, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of email address in 'description' field; empty 'url' and 'license' fields; no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with static metadata, no code injection, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The only unusual aspect is placeholder or incomplete metadata, which is common in draft or incomplete setup files but not malicious. Dependency 'cryptography' is a legitimate security library. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk score reflects incomplete metadata rather than malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
