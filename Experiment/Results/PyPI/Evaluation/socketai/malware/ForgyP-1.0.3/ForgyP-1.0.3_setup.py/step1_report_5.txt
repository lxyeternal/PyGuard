  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'ForgyP', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, specifically the 'install_requires' list and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicating malicious data handling; dependency list is static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or suspicious email and URL fields; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, author info, and dependencies. No user input, untrusted data, or code execution is involved. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The dependency 'cryptography==40.0.2' is a common library and does not indicate malicious intent. Placeholder email and URL fields suggest incomplete metadata but do not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code.",
