  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ForgyP Python module",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and install_requires",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted input or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the script only defines package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs; the email address appears as a placeholder but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata including name, version, author info, and dependencies. There are no code execution, data processing, or network activities. The presence of hardcoded email and license fields are typical in setup scripts but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
