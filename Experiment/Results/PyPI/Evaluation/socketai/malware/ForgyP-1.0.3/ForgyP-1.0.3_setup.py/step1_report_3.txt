  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the ForgyP Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, such as name, version, author, email, description, and required packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines static package metadata and dependencies with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of empty strings for 'url' and 'license', which may indicate incomplete information, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script used for packaging Python projects. It specifies package metadata, author info, and dependencies. The only notable point is empty 'url' and 'license' fields, which could be incomplete but not malicious. The required dependency 'cryptography==40.0.2' is a common security library, not suspicious. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be an incomplete but benign package configuration.",
