      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package's setup process appears legitimate, but the embedded payload warrants further investigation. The overall security risk is significant due to obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment tactics."
