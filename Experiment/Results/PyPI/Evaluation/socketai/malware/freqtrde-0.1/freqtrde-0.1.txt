It should be classified as malicious with a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 1.0. It is highly suspicious and should be treated as a supply chain security threat, warranting immediate review and removal from any package repository."

      "conclusion": "The majority of the code is benign, with Report 4 showing signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns but no confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustments could increase malware suspicion slightly but are not necessary."
