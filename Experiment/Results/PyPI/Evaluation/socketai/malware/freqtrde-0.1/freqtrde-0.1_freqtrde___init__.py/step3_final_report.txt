  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of environment variables, function parameters, external modules, and potential network or file interactions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, dynamic code execution points such as eval().",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file operations, possibly via eval() or dynamic imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval(), obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, and dynamic code patterns without confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no suspicious activity, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 highlights obfuscation and eval() usage, justifying higher suspicion scores. The scores are consistent with the described patterns, with Report 4 warranting a slightly higher malware score (~0.3) and obfuscation (~0.7). The confidence levels reflect the certainty of suspicion, with benign reports having high confidence (0.9) and suspicious ones slightly lower (0.6-0.7). Overall, the assessments are well-aligned with the code behaviors, and the scoring is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code is benign, with Report 4 showing signs of obfuscation and suspicious patterns but no confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustments could increase malware suspicion slightly but are not necessary.",
