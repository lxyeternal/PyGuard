  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input/output functions, network or file operations, environment variable usage, and any suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input reading or data sources to sinks such as network or file outputs, potentially indicating malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, suspicious imports, or patterns indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports are based on high-level descriptions with minimal or no code snippets. They consistently identify benign scripts with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The confidence levels vary appropriately with the amount of information. Malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging potential general risks. Obfuscated scores are zero due to lack of evidence of obfuscation. The reasoning in each report is sound given the limited data, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code information, all reports correctly assess the scripts as benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent and appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary. If more detailed code or context becomes available, re-evaluation is recommended.",
