{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a script intended for data processing or system interaction, possibly part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, possibly from user input, environment variables, or external files, depending on the context.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to output functions such as print statements, logging, or network connections, and potentially to file system writes or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from sources (user input, environment variables, external files) flows into processing functions, and may reach sinks like network or file output, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code does not contain obfuscated sections or suspicious control flow. No unusual imports or code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is relatively straightforward with clear structure, reading data from standard sources and performing typical processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network abuse are identified. There are no indications of code injection, unsafe SQL, or unsafe environment variable usage. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or complex dynamic execution. Without additional context or external dependencies, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It seems to be a standard, benign script with no suspicious behavior detected.",
