{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing and possibly communicates over the network.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables and user input functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, and subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching network or file output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network domains observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language constructs detected. Code structure appears typical for data processing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input from environment variables and user prompts, processes data using standard functions, and may perform network or file operations. No indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system manipulation. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and justified. No suspicious or malicious code patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is a typical data processing script with no indicators of malware or sabotage.",
