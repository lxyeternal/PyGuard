{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'pyhulul', including an obfuscated code execution step during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and a large obfuscated string during installation. It also reads a README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) function executes dynamically decoded code, which is the primary sink where malicious behavior could be introduced.",
  "flows": "The code takes the obfuscated string, applies XOR decryption with a numeric key string, and then executes the resulting code via eval(compile()).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, use of eval(compile()), and a hardcoded encrypted payload suggest malicious intent or malicious intent obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines an InstallCommand class that overrides the run method. Inside run, it attempts to decode an obfuscated string by XORing each character with a repeated key string. The decoded string is then executed with eval(compile()). The obfuscated string appears as a large binary blob, indicating intentional concealment of code. The use of try-except with a silent pass prevents errors from stopping execution. Such obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical signs of malicious or suspicious activity in supply chain attacks. No other suspicious behavior, such as network connections or system modifications, is present in this code fragment. The code's primary suspicious feature is the obfuscated code that is dynamically decoded and executed, which can conceal malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes dynamically during installation, representing a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The use of eval and compile on encoded payloads suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions. Caution is strongly advised against installing this package.",
