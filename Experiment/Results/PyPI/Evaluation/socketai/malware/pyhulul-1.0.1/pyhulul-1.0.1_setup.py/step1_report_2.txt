{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' which is decoded and executed during install.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) line which executes decoded code, acting as a sink for potentially malicious payload.",
  "flows": "The code decodes an obfuscated payload from 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc', then compiles and evaluates it, resulting in dynamic execution during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, encoded string that is decoded at runtime and executed with eval(compile()), which is unusual and suspicious in a setup script. The string appears random and complex, indicating intentional concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom 'InstallCommand' that overrides the 'run' method. Inside 'run', it attempts to decode a long, obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' using a XOR cipher with a numeric key derived from 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'. The decoded string is then executed using eval(compile()). This approach is highly suspicious because it hides potentially malicious code, executes during package installation, and employs obfuscation techniques typical of malware. The rest of the setup function appears standard, but the critical code responsible for executing hidden payloads indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated malicious code that executes during installation, likely as a backdoor or malicious payload. The use of obfuscation, runtime decoding, and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious behavior. This code should be considered dangerous and not used.",
