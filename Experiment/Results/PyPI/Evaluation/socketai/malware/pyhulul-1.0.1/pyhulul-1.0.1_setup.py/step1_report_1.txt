{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyhulul', defining installation behavior and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc', a long numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp', and the contents of 'README.md'. It also reads data during the loop for deobfuscation.",
  "sinks": "The code executes dynamic code with 'eval(compile(...))', which is a high-risk sink for executing potentially malicious code derived from obfuscated data.",
  "flows": "Data from the obfuscated string is decoded through XOR with the numeric string, then compiled and executed with eval. The 'run' method in the custom install class performs this flow, which results in executing hidden code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated string data, dynamic code execution via eval/compile, and a complex XOR-based decoding process all suggest concealment of malicious intent. The code actively hides its true operations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package setup parameters and overrides the install command to include a deobfuscation routine. The obfuscated string is XOR-decoded using a long numeric key, then dynamically compiled and executed. This pattern is characteristic of malicious code designed to conceal its behavior. The code reads 'README.md' safely for long description, but the critical part is the obfuscated string, which upon decoding is executed as code. There are no external inputs, but the presence of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hidden code strongly indicate malicious intent. No other suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident outside of the obfuscation technique used.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payloads that are decoded and executed at runtime, which is highly suspicious. The intent appears to be concealing malicious code, making this package potentially dangerous. The use of dynamic code execution without transparency is a critical security concern.",
