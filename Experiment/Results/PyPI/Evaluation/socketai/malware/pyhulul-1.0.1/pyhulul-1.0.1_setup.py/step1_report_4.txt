  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pyhulul', with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and the hardcoded obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' in the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded and deobfuscated code via eval and compile in the run method of the custom install class.",
  "flows": "Reading the obfuscated string -> decoding it with XOR operation -> compiling and evaluating the code -> executing potentially malicious payload during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated string decoded at runtime, followed by eval(compile(...)), which indicates code obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The obfuscated string is long and appears to be binary data masked as text. The code also uses a hardcoded string of digits for XOR decoding. The use of try-except that suppresses errors further indicates concealment. The code execution occurs during the install process, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks. The significant concern is within the custom 'InstallCommand' class, where during 'run', it decodes an obfuscated string using XOR with a numeric key string. The decoded string is then executed via eval after compilation, meaning any malicious payload embedded within the obfuscated string would run during installation. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are common tactics to hide malicious behavior. The use of a try-except that passes suppresses errors, making detection harder. No other external inputs are read, but the code's core purpose is to run potentially malicious code at install time, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically decoded code executed during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The use of obfuscation, eval, and compile strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to conceal harmful payloads. This package should not be trusted for installation.",
