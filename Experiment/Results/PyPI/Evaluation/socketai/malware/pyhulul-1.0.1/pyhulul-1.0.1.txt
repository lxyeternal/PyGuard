      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Benign code is correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation levels. Suspicious patterns, especially in report 5, justify high malware and risk scores. Slightly lowering the malware score in report 2 could improve accuracy if no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. The assessments are well-founded and align with best practices for supply chain security analysis."

No further adjustments are necessary. If more detailed code or context becomes available, re-evaluation is recommended."
