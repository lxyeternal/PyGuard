  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell payload conditioned on filesystem state. The package setup appears standard but is likely a vector for executing malicious code during installation. The overall security risk is high, and the malware suspicion is justified."
