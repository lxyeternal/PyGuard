  "purpose": "Detect malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risks in the code executing an encoded PowerShell command during setup.",
  "sources": "The check for 'tahg' and the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executing the encoded command, which could lead to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' and, if absent, executes the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent exception handling, and suspicious comment referencing an untrusted domain.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, likely malicious. Silent exception handling conceals failures. The encoded command's content is hidden, but its execution context and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. Multiple reports correctly identify these issues, assigning high malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security risk is high due to potential remote code execution, data theft, or persistence mechanisms embedded in the obfuscated command.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code executed during setup, indicating a high likelihood of supply chain compromise. It should be flagged for further analysis, and distribution should be halted until the encoded command is decoded and verified.",
