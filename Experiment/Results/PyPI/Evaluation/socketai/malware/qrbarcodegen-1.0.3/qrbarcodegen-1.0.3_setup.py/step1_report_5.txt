{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes a Python script from a remote URL, ostensibly to generate QR codes.",
  "sources": "The code constructs a URL from obfuscated strings and makes an HTTP GET request to download a Python script.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script is written to 'qrcodegen.py' and then immediately executed via subprocess.check_call.",
  "flows": "The URL is constructed dynamically, the script is fetched from the remote location, saved locally, and then executed within the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The URL is heavily obfuscated and dynamically assembled, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. The code executes code fetched from an external source without validation. There are no checks on the response content, such as signature verification or validation of script integrity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install command. It constructs a URL from individual string segments that, when combined, point to a remote location on a CDN. During the install process, it fetches this remote script and executes it immediately, without any validation or restrictions. This behavior resembles malicious activity, as it could allow remote code execution during package installation. The obfuscation of the URL and the dynamic execution are suspicious and suggest potential malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by dynamically constructing a remote URL and executing fetched code during installation without validation. This pattern aligns with malicious supply chain tactics or backdoors. It poses a significant security risk and should be treated as potentially malicious.",
