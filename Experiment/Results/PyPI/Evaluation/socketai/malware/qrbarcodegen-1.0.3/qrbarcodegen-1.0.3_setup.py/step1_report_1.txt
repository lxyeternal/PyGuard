{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute a remote Python script as part of the package setup.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed from obfuscated string parts, used in the requests.get() call to download external code.",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded content to 'qrcodegen.py' and then executing it via subprocess.check_call.",
  "flows": "The URL string is assembled from obfuscated variables, fetched via HTTP request, written to a file, then executed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL construction, dynamic download and execution of remote code during package installation, use of subprocess to run downloaded code.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the 'install' command to perform an HTTP GET request to a URL composed of obfuscated string parts. The content retrieved is saved as 'qrcodegen.py' and immediately executed, potentially allowing remote code execution during installation. The URL points to a domain (cdn.co.net) constructed from the obfuscated parts, which is suspicious. The code does not validate the downloaded content, making it vulnerable to malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are common indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attack techniques.",
  "conclusion": "This code attempts to download and execute a remote Python script during package installation, which poses a significant security risk. The obfuscation and execution of external code are typical malicious behaviors, indicating likely malicious intent. This package should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
