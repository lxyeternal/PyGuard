{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a URL from obfuscated parts, downloads a script during installation, writes it to 'qrcodegen.py', and executes it immediately, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The URL is constructed from obfuscated string variables; the code reads external data via HTTP GET request.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script 'qrcodegen.py' is executed via subprocess, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Constructed URL -> HTTP GET request -> Write response to 'qrcodegen.py' -> Execute 'qrcodegen.py' via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL construction; dynamic download and execution of remote code during setup without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code obfuscates the URL using string concatenation, then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL. The response content is saved to a file and executed immediately, with no validation or signature check. This pattern indicates malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks or malware. The obfuscation complicates detection, but behaviorally, it performs remote code execution during package installation, which is highly dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, performing remote code download and execution during setup without validation. The obfuscation further indicates malicious intent. The high scores are appropriate, and the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
