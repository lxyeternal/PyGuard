  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom vidstream.streaming import StreamingServer\nfrom vidstream.streaming import CameraClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import VideoClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import ScreenShareClient\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioSender\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioReceiver\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General observations:**\n- The code only contains import statements; no logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- The `vidstream` library is an open-source package designed for media streaming, commonly used for real-time video/audio applications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior based solely on imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that these are import statements for streaming functionalities.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious activity is visible.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward import statements.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies benign nature; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same import statements.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious activity; only import statements.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, possibly reflecting a cautious stance. However, given only import statements, this is an overly conservative estimate. The code itself does not pose a security risk.\n- **Verdict:** I would suggest lowering `securityRisk` to 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly notes no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Note:** Similar to Report 4, the risk score might be slightly overstated for just import statements.\n- **Verdict:** Recommend lowering `securityRisk` to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and only consists of import statements.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty about benign intent.\n- The only minor issue is the `securityRisk` scores of 0.1 in reports 4 and 5, which seem overly cautious given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0, since no security issues are present in import statements alone.\n- **Overall risk estimate:** Given only import statements, the overall risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code snippet. The only adjustment I recommend is to set the `securityRisk` scores to 0 for reports 4 and 5, aligning with the benign, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context—such as how these classes are instantiated or used—there's no reason to suspect malicious activity. The code appears to be standard setup code for a media streaming application.",
