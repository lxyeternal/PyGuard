  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to streaming video and audio for real-time communication or media sharing.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code only imports modules and classes; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes from the 'vidstream' library related to streaming, camera, video, screen sharing, and audio functionalities. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors shown. Without any function calls, data processing, or network activity, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues. The imported modules appear to be intended for media streaming purposes and do not, in isolation, pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, containing only import statements for media streaming classes. No malicious activity, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident based solely on these imports.",
