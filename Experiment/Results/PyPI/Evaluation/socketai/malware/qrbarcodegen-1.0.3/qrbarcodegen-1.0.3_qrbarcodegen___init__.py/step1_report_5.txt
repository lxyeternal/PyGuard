{
  "purpose": "Import statements for a video and audio streaming library, likely used for real-time communication or media sharing.",
  "sources": "The module vidstream.streaming and vidstream.audio, which are external packages providing streaming and audio functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or untrusted data processing are shown in this snippet; the code only imports classes.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow is demonstrated; the code only imports classes without instantiating or invoking methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statements themselves; no suspicious or hardcoded secrets or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the vidstream package, importing classes related to streaming and audio functionalities. There are no data inputs, network connections, or code execution flows visible. Since no additional code is provided, it is impossible to evaluate runtime behavior, data handling, or potential malicious activity. The imports appear to be standard for media streaming applications, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be straightforward import statements for media streaming classes. Without further context or implementation, the code presents a low security concern.",
