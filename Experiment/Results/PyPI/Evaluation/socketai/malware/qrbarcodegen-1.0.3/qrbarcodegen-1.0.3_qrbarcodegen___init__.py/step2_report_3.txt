  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on import statements from the 'vidstream' library.\n- No executable code, data flows, network activity, or credentials are present.\n- The 'malware' scores are all zero, which aligns with the lack of malicious activity.\n- The 'obfuscated' scores are zero, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are mostly zero or very low, which is appropriate given the limited code context.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code only imports classes.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Score justification:** No issues, scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly less confident (confidence 0.9), but still consistent.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), perhaps considering that in a real application, these imports could be used maliciously if combined with other code.\n- **Justification:** Since only import statements are shown, this is still low risk. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues; only import statements.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** All aligned with the code shown.\n- **Potential issues:** None evident; no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 or very close to 0, given the limited context and absence of any suspicious behavior.\n\n**Additional note:** If these reports are meant to flag potential security issues, they are overly cautious given the minimal code. However, since the reports are comprehensive and consistent, I agree with their current scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code snippet is benign, and the reports correctly identify it as such.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.",
