  "purpose": "Import statements for a video and audio streaming library, likely used for real-time communication or streaming applications.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: vidstream.streaming and vidstream.audio",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or data processing occurs in these import statements alone",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; only import statements without any executable logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes related to streaming video, camera, screen sharing, audio sender and receiver from the 'vidstream' library. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior evident. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution are present. The snippet is purely import statements, serving as setup for application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of streaming-related classes from a legitimate library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
