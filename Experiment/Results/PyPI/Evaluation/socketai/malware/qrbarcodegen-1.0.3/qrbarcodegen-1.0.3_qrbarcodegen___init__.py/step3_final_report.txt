{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes related to media streaming and audio functionalities from the 'vidstream' library, likely for setting up streaming services.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; only static imports.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import statements only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements for streaming and audio classes, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The 'vidstream' library is open-source and used for real-time media streaming. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The minimal code suggests setup or configuration code for streaming functionalities, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements for streaming classes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0. The high confidence score reflects certainty in its benign nature.",
