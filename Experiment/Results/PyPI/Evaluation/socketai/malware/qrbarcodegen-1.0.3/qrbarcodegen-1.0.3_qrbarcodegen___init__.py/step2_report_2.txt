  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on import statements with no execution logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- The 'malware' scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The 'obfuscated' scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the limited code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only import statements with no execution logic, and no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or reasoning flaws:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly conclude that the code is benign based solely on the provided snippet.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The 'malware' scores are all 0, which is appropriate.  \n  The 'obfuscated' scores are 0, which makes sense given no obfuscation.  \n  The 'securityRisk' scores are mostly 0 or 0.1; given the lack of executable code, these are reasonable. Slightly higher scores (0.1) in some reports may reflect a cautious approach, but perhaps could be lowered to 0 for absolute certainty.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are below or equal to 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware scores?**  \n  Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only state that the code is benign based on import statements.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust 'securityRisk' scores:**  \n  Since the code contains only import statements with no executable or data handling, the 'securityRisk' scores could be uniformly set to 0 to reflect minimal risk.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  The high confidence is justified, but if more context or code were available, the confidence could be higher. Given only import statements, the current levels are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based solely on these import statements, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (more accurate than 0.1, given no executable code)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable, but 'securityRisk' could be lowered to 0.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues is present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet.",
