  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the 'rwquests' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, accessing package metadata, and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external influence are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting package metadata -> defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python packaging practices with 'setuptools'. It reads a README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. All dependencies are version-restricted and originate from known package sources. There is no code that reads user input, environment variables, or performs network operations. The package configuration appears typical and does not contain obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
