{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the package metadata and configuration for the Python package 'rwquests', including dependencies and project information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and defining package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code primarily defines static configuration and metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; all data is static or read from a controlled file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The package data, URLs, and dependencies appear legitimate and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python modules to read a Markdown file and define package metadata for setuptools. No dynamic execution, network connections, or data processing that could be malicious are present. Dependencies are specified with version constraints, and URLs point to official documentation and repositories. The code structure aligns with typical setup.py files. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks and references legitimate sources and dependencies.",
