{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'rwquests' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static package metadata; dependency lists; package data files.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The 'package_dir' mapping 'requests' to 'requests' appears inconsistent with the package name 'rwquests', likely a typo or misconfiguration but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static configuration data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The only unusual element is the 'package_dir' mapping which may cause packaging issues but does not introduce security risks. All dependency versions are from reputable sources, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, typical setup configuration with no malicious intent. The minor inconsistency in 'package_dir' should be corrected for proper packaging but does not pose a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0.0 to 0.2).",
