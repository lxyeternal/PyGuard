{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for the Python package 'rwquests', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file for long description; accesses package metadata variables; retrieves dependency lists; reads package files specified in package_data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; setup parameters are standard and do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file -> stores content as long_description; assigns package metadata -> uses in setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; all code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads a README.md file and defines package metadata and dependencies for the setup process. It does not execute any untrusted or external code at runtime. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The package data and dependencies are standard and related to the package's functionality. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The script adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles package configuration in a conventional manner without any suspicious behavior.",
