{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'rwquests', including metadata, dependencies, and packaging options.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; accessing metadata variables; defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Input from README.md flows into long_description; static metadata flows into setup parameters; dependency lists are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It loads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. All data sources are static or controlled files, with no external input or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, it appears to be a benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe for use, with no indicators of malware or malicious code injection.",
