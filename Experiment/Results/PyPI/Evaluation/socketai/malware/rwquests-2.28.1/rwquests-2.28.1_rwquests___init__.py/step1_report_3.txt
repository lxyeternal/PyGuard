  "purpose": "The code imports functions for HTTP request methods from the 'frequest' library, likely intended for making network requests.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which does not read input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code snippet; no untrusted data handling or potential data leak points are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows or function calls are demonstrated in the snippet; it's solely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'frequest' is unusual and similar to 'requests', a common HTTP library, but this alone isn't suspicious. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, bringing in HTTP methods from a library named 'frequest'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data handling, or unusual code constructs. The snippet does not perform any network requests or data processing, so no security risks are observable from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The import appears straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
