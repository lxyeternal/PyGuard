  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing functions from the 'frequest' package, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing get, post, put, patch, delete functions from 'frequest' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of imported functions, network activity, data handling, or malicious code execution triggered elsewhere in the codebase.",
  "flows": "Import statement as source; actual function calls or network operations as sinks (not shown in snippet).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'frequest' resembling 'requests' but non-standard; no usage or further code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions from a non-standard module 'frequest'. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident from this snippet. The main concern is the suspicious package name, which could be a typo or maliciously crafted. Scores assigned in reports reflect low malware likelihood (0.2 or below), no obfuscation, and low to moderate risk (0.1-0.4), justified by the unusual package name. Without further context or code execution, the import alone does not indicate malicious intent, but the package's legitimacy warrants verification.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement appears benign, but the suspicious package name 'frequest' justifies cautious review. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate given the limited information. Further investigation into the package's origin and contents is recommended before use.",
