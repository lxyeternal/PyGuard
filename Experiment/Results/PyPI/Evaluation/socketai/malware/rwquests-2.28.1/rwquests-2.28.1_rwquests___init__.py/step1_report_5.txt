{
  "purpose": "Import HTTP request methods from the 'frequest' library, likely intended for making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'frequest' library, which is a third-party package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling present in this snippet; potential use in other parts of the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code only shows import statements with no additional logic. The use of an unfamiliar 'frequest' module, which could be a typo or a less common library, warrants caution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions for HTTP methods from the 'frequest' module. The snippet is extremely limited, providing no further logic, data processing, or network activity. 'frequest' is not a standard library, raising some questions about its origin or intent, but on its own, the import is not malicious. Without additional code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security issues apparent. However, the use of a non-standard library warrants further review of the full code context to ensure it does not introduce risks.",
