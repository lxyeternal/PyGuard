  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior involving decryption and execution of code.",
  "sources": "os.name check, imported modules ('requests', 'fernet'), encrypted data used in Fernet decryption",
  "sinks": "exec() call with decrypted code, which executes potentially malicious code",
  "flows": "os.name condition triggers decryption, which feeds into exec() to run decrypted code during installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted code; encrypted payload; import of 'requests' and 'fernet' only during Windows; cryptic description and long description strings; no visible benign purpose for decryption and execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, if on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload and executes it with exec(). The use of Fernet suggests the payload is encrypted to evade static detection. The encrypted data and the exec() call indicate possible malicious activity, such as remote code execution or payload delivery during package installation. The package metadata appears benign but is likely a cover for malicious behavior. The script’s main suspicious activity is the decrypted code execution during installation, which is a typical supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicates potential malware or backdoor activity. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() is a common tactic to conceal malicious intent.",
