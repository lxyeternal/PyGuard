{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation command that decrypts and executes hidden code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The decryption key and encrypted payload within the custom install class, specifically the Fernet key and the exec() call with decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious payload is embedded.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a payload using Fernet and executes it immediately, potentially running malicious code without user knowledge.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted code that is decrypted and executed dynamically during setup; hardcoded Fernet key; obfuscated and encrypted payload; code executed during install rather than runtime; no meaningful package functionality evident.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is typical for packaging, but it contains a malicious backdoor: a Fernet key is hardcoded, and during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes arbitrary code. This behavior indicates an intentional malicious feature designed to run hidden code during package installation, which could perform harmful actions. The presence of encrypted payload and dynamic execution is suspicious and suggests malicious intent or sabotage. No benign or legitimate functionality is apparent beyond package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to the embedded encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows. This indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
