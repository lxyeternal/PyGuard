{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package and includes a custom install command that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes encrypted payload using Fernet during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec, potential network activity during import requests, and use of Fernet decryption key suggest potential malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "On Windows (os.name=='nt'), the code imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts an encrypted payload with Fernet and executes it via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload, use of Fernet to decrypt and execute code at install time, hardcoded decryption key, and code execution during setup are suspicious. The description strings are nonsensical and do not serve a clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package setup with a custom install command that conditionally, during installation on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key and executes it via exec. This pattern is highly suspicious because it can be used to run malicious code during package installation. The code has no legitimate reason to decrypt and execute code at install time, especially with hardcoded keys and encrypted payload. The inclusion of encrypted code and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing potentially harmful code during installation, which is a supply chain security risk. The presence of encrypted payloads and hardcoded decryption keys is suspicious. The package should not be used.",
