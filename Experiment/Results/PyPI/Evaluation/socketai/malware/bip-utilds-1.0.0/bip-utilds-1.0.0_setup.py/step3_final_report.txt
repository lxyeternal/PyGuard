{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload during setup, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and contains hardcoded encrypted payloads and decryption keys.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via 'exec()', which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potential system compromise, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "The code checks OS, then imports modules, decrypts the payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via 'exec()' during installation on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and hardcoded decryption key, use of 'exec()' on decrypted data, conditional execution only on Windows, nonsensical description strings suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a custom install class that, during Windows installation, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, executing it via 'exec()'. The encrypted payload and key are suspicious, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious code. The use of 'exec()' on decrypted data is a high-risk behavior, typical of supply chain malware or backdoors. The obfuscated description strings further suggest malicious intent. The high malware score (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) assigned by the reports are justified, reflecting the dangerous nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious, potentially malicious behavior, including encrypted payload decryption and execution during package installation, which poses a significant security threat. The high scores and analysis confirm this as a supply chain attack vector. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
