{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs custom installation code, including decrypting and executing hidden code.",
  "sources": "The script reads environment info (os.name), and imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() call executes decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "Environment info (os.name) triggers conditional import of requests and Fernet, which then decrypts and executes code with exec(), potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload, use of exec() on decrypted content, encrypted data appears suspicious, minimal descriptive metadata, and obfuscated descriptions and variables. The code decrypts and executes code dynamically, which is a common indicator of malicious obfuscation or backdoor.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but includes a suspicious block within a custom install class. When on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it via exec(). The decrypted payload could be malicious, as this pattern often hides malicious code. The use of encrypted payload and exec() without clear context strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity or backdoor access. Overall, the structure indicates malicious intent, or at best, highly suspicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains potentially malicious behavior due to the use of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution. It appears designed to hide malicious code that is decrypted and run during installation, especially on Windows systems. This is a security risk and should be reviewed further before use.",
