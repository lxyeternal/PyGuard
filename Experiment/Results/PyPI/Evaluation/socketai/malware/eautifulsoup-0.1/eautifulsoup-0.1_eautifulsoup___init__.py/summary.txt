  "conclusion": "The assessments are generally accurate and conservative. The only adjustment recommended is increasing the malware score in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0.3 to account for obfuscation and suspicious data flow, while maintaining low overall risk scores. The code appears benign across all reports, with no confirmed malicious activity."
