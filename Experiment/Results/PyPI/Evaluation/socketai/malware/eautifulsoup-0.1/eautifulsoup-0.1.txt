      "conclusion": "This package is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its heavy obfuscation, system modifications, privilege escalation, and dynamic code execution point toward malicious intent. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious, and further detailed analysis in a controlled environment is strongly recommended."

The only adjustment recommended is increasing the malware score in Report 4 from 0.2 to 0.3 to account for obfuscation and suspicious data flow, while maintaining low overall risk scores. The code appears benign across all reports, with no confirmed malicious activity."
