  "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical malware behaviors: decoding obfuscated payloads, writing malicious scripts to system directories, and executing them stealthily. The heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and use of environment variables and 'shell=True' in subprocess confirm malicious intent. The high malware score (0.9), obfuscation score (0.85), and security risk score (0.9) are justified based on these behaviors."
