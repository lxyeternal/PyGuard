{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; these are solely class definitions for exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, output, or untrusted data handling is present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only class declarations without operational code",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains exception class definitions with no operational or malicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. These classes are likely intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy or network-related operations. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing logic; just class declarations. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for network error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
