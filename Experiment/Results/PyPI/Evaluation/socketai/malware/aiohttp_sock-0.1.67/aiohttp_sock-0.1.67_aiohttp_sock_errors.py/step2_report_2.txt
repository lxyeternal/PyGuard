  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class declarations for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or network interactions.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain embedded logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score 0.\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the provided code.\n   - Their conclusions are supported by the code's content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Summary of My Own Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks present.\n\n**Final Remarks**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are correct in their assessment. The code is purely structural with no malicious or security implications.",
