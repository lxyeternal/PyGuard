{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input data reading, no external data sources, only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no data processing, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are simple exception declarations without dynamic or data-driven behavior.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are straightforward exception subclasses with no embedded logic, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors and related proxy errors. No functions, data input, network operations, or dynamic execution are present. These classes are standard in structure, serving as exception types for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes without any operational code, malicious payload, or security concerns. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger codebase.",
