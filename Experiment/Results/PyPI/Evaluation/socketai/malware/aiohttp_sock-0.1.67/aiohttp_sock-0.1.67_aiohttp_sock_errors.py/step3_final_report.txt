  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class declarations defining exception types; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are purely declarative with no execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard class declarations and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors, with no operational logic, network interactions, or embedded payloads. All reports correctly identify the benign, structural nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in these assessments is high (1.0). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is standard and safe, serving as part of an error handling module without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
