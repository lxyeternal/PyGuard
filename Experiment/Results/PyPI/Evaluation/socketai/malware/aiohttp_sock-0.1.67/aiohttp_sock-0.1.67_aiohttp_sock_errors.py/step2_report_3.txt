  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and network issues. There are no data flows, network operations, input/output handling, or executable logic. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \nAll reports explicitly state that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The classes are simple and serve as error indicators, with no embedded logic or payloads.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:  \n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware**: All reports assign a score of 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified since the code is purely structural and contains no vulnerabilities or risky constructs.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**:  \n- The reports are consistent in their assessment.  \n- Since the code is purely exception class definitions, there is no reason to assign higher scores for malware or obfuscation.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation and Recommendations**:  \n- The code is benign and serves as part of an error handling module.  \n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (since error handling classes generally pose no security risk, but in the context of supply chain, a minimal score reflects that they are part of a larger codebase; however, given no malicious intent, this can remain very low).\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No changes needed. The code is safe and not a security concern.",
