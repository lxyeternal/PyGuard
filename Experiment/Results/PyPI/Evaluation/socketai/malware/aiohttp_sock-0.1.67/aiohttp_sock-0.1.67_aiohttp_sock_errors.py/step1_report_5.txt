  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors for error handling in network applications.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or control flow involving untrusted input is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly defines exception classes with no additional logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no data inputs, network operations, code execution, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard way to define error classes for a network proxy library or module. The structure and naming are conventional and do not suggest obfuscation, malicious intent, or embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as error handling scaffolding for SOCKS proxy operations. No malware or security issues are present.",
