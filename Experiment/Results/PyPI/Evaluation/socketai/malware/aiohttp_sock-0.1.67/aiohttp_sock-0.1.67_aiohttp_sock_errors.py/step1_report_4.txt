  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only establishes class hierarchies and does not perform runtime operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from base exception types. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The classes are used to represent specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations, and they do not contain any embedded code or malicious constructs. The structure is typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions purely as a set of error representations.",
