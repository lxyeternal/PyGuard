  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no operational, input/output, or network-related code segments.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, data handling, or malicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no security risks, and no obfuscation, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as part of an error handling module.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to factual observations about the code's structure.\n   - They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or hidden malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of operational logic, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is benign and serves a clear purpose within an error handling context.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and the scoring aligns with the content.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
