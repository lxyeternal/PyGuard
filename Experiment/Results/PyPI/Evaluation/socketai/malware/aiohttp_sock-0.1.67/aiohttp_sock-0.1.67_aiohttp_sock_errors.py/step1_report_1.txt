{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; all are class declarations for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations; code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; no source-to-sink paths as there are no executable statements or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions, with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception classes such as Exception and OSError. These classes are intended for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. There are no input reading, data processing, or network operations. The structure and content are straightforward and follow standard Python practices for custom exceptions. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are present. The code appears purely structural without any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as part of an error handling module without any harmful intent.",
