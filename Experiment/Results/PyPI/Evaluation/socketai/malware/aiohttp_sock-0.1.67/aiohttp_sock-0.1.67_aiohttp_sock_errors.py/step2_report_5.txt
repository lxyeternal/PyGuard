  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no operational, input/output, or network activities, which aligns with the code snippet provided. No issues are present in the actual code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation. The confidence scores are all at 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment. These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no executable or network code, the risk scores should remain at 0. No potential vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or security issues are suggested or implied.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as purely structural, with no embedded malicious logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. Therefore, there is no security concern, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe provided reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
