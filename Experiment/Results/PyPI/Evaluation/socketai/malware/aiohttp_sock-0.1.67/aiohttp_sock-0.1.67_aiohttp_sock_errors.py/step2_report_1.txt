  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the correctness of their assessments, the scores assigned, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data processing, network operations, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), indicating certainty about the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only contains class declarations for exceptions; no issues are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical flaws or overstatements are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate since no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign content.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0, justified given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0; no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code is non-executable, purely declarative, and standard.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0, since no malicious activity is indicated.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as exception class definitions without embedded logic.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - Scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the assessments in all reports. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, safe component of an error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes:\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern elements. The assigned scores reflect this accurately.",
