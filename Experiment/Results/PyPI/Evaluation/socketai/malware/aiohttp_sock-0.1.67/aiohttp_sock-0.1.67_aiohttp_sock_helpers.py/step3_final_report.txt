  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, and establish asynchronous network connections through these proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, function parameters (host, port, credentials), external libraries (yarl, aiohttp_sock)",
  "sinks": "Network connection functions (asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection), socket connections",
  "flows": "Input parameters and proxy URL parsing → socket wrapper creation → connection establishment via asyncio → data flow through socket",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code correctly parses proxy URLs, validates inputs, creates appropriate SOCKS socket wrappers, and manages connections asynchronously. It handles errors properly and uses standard libraries and third-party modules without any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The use of untrusted proxy URLs is a potential vector for misuse but is typical in such utilities and does not constitute a security flaw in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 are consistent with the analysis.",
