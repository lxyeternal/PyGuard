  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish network connections asynchronously via these proxies.\n- It uses standard libraries (`asyncio`, `socket`, `urllib.parse`) and third-party libraries (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`) for proxy handling and URL parsing.\n- Input validation appears appropriate; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- The functions enforce constraints and handle errors properly.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5**: All conclude that the code is legitimate, with no malicious intent, and assign malware scores of 0, security risk scores of 0.2, and obfuscated scores of 0. Their reasoning is consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code appears correct; no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly identify the code as a standard proxy connection utility with no malicious features.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious code.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  Security risk: 0.2 — possibly considering the inherent risks of handling untrusted proxy URLs, which is reasonable.  \n  These scores are consistent and justified.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are below 0.5, indicating low to moderate concern, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Malware score justification?**  \n  Zero is justified; no malicious payloads or behaviors are present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Security risk score:** **0.2** — moderate, considering the handling of untrusted proxy URLs, which is typical in such utilities but still warrants cautious use.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is well-structured, with proper validation and error handling.  \n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors or backdoors.  \n- The use of third-party libraries is standard and does not introduce hidden risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided code is a legitimate, standard implementation for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks beyond typical considerations for handling untrusted proxy URLs.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2     | Handling untrusted URLs can pose minor risks; overall low. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose security threats based on the provided analysis.",
