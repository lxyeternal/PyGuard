{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with URL parsing and asynchronous connection handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables (via asyncio.get_event_loop()), and the proxy URL provided as an argument to parse_proxy_url.",
  "sinks": "The code establishes network connections via asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection, which use socket objects created based on parsed or default proxy settings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, socks_url) flow into parsing and socket creation functions, which then connect via SOCKS proxies and pass sockets to asyncio connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Proxy URL parsing handles user info, but passwords are handled securely via unquote without storage. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs. The code uses standard libraries and established patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard asyncio and socket modules, along with URL parsing and third-party SOCKS proxy handling libraries. Functions are designed to create socket wrappers based on proxy type, parse proxy URLs, and open network connections asynchronously. The parse_proxy_url function correctly extracts host, port, username, and password from the URL, supporting URL-encoded credentials. The connection functions enforce the presence of host and port parameters, raising exceptions if missing. They support optional SOCKS proxy configuration via URL or direct parameters. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code follows safe practices for network connection handling and uses established libraries. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden commands, or privacy violations. The overall implementation appears legitimate and aligned with standard practices for SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The code handles input securely, avoids hardcoded secrets, and relies on well-known libraries. Overall, it is safe for use.",
