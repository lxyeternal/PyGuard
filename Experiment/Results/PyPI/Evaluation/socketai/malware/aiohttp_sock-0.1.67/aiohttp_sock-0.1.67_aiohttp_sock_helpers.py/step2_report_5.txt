  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for creating SOCKS proxy sockets and establishing network connections via asyncio.\n- It parses proxy URLs, supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and uses standard libraries and third-party packages (aiohttp_sock, yarl).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions perform input validation and handle errors appropriately.\n- The data flow is straightforward: input parameters → URL parsing → socket wrapper creation → connection establishment.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or covert channels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, and the logic aligns with standard practices for proxy connection handling.\n- **Malware presence:** The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate 0 obfuscated code, which is consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n- **Security risk:** The scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal risk, primarily due to reliance on external inputs (proxy URLs), which should be trusted or validated in real deployments.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n\n- **Input validation:** The code relies on URL parsing and validation, but it does not explicitly restrict or sanitize the proxy URL beyond basic parsing. However, this is standard practice.\n- **Use of untrusted input:** Proxy URLs are parsed and used directly. If untrusted, they could lead to misconfiguration or connection to malicious proxies, but this is outside the scope of code security—more about deployment practices.\n- **Error handling:** Proper exceptions are raised when inputs are invalid or proxy type is unsupported.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, reflecting potential misuse if untrusted proxy URLs are used, but no inherent security flaw.\n\nThese scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n- The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code, backdoors, or payloads present.          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.        |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2     | Slight risk due to untrusted input handling; no inherent flaws.|\n\n**Estimated overall risk: Low.** The code functions as intended for proxy connection management without malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with my analysis. No changes to scores are necessary. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
