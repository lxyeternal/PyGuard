{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to a proxy connection library, including error classes, connection functions, and proxy type constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and module-level constants (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; functions and classes are imported or defined but not invoked or used with untrusted input here.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up exports; no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from local modules, assigns versioning, and defines exportable symbols. There is no dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity. It appears to be a straightforward module setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script for a proxy-related library. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or security-risk behaviors. It simply organizes and exposes components for use elsewhere.",
