{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define exports and import dependencies for a SOCKS proxy handling library, likely to facilitate proxy connections in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from local files (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external input sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from external sources to sinks are evident; the code primarily imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The version string is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and exports. It sets a version, lists public symbols, and imports various components necessary for proxy connection management. No input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It functions as a module setup and export definition, with no harmful behavior detected.",
