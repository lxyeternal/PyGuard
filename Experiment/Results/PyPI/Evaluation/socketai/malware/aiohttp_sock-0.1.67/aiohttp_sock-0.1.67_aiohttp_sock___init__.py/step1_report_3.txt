{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports, constants, and exportable symbols for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy connections, facilitating proxy communication and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from local package files (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data sources or input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input, perform data output, or execute network requests directly.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up imports and exports symbols without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The version string is a typical package versioning detail.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly serves as an __init__.py or module initializer, importing components and exposing them for package use. It does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or security-sensitive operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exports components related to SOCKS proxy functionality.",
