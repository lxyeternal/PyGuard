  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for a proxy connection library, exporting classes, error types, and helper functions related to SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable; the code only imports and exports symbols without processing data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs observed. No input handling or network operations are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a package __init__.py that defines and exports modules, classes, and constants. There are no data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The imports are from local modules, indicating internal package structure. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module export file, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe based on its content.",
