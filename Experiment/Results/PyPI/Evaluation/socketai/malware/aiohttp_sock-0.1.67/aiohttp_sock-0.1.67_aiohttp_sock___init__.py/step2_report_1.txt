  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is primarily importing modules, defining a version string, and exporting symbols.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or any obfuscated/malicious constructs.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward `__init__.py` or module setup file for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is clean, simple, and standard for module exports.\n   - The version string is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n   - Confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty that the assessments are correct.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly assume this is a benign, module setup code with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what the code shows; given the simplicity, these are justified.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since this is only a small part of a larger package, the overall security depends on the rest of the codebase.\n   - However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                  | 0          |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code fragment is a benign module setup script, serving as an interface for a SOCKS proxy library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
