{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script, exporting classes, constants, and functions related to a SOCKS proxy library, facilitating their import in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the version string __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only defines and exports symbols without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing internal components, defining a version, and exporting symbols via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. The absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty that the code is benign and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
