  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard, protocol-compliant SOCKS4/5 implementation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It emphasizes proper error handling and the absence of suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code matches the description. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, highlighting standard protocol adherence, proper error handling, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.95\n\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent with the code. No issues detected. The security risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, emphasizes standard implementation, no malicious behavior, and safe handling of credentials and network data.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2, confidence: 0.95\n\n- **Evaluation:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) possibly due to the handling of credentials, but still within a safe range. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar positive evaluation, noting proper management of socket operations, address resolution, and no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2, confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard, protocol-compliant nature, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2, confidence: 0.9\n\n- **Evaluation:** Also consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxies.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the analysis. Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the handling of credentials and network communication, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n\n**Risk score:** Approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with the reports, given the handling of credentials and network operations but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients.  \n- No signs of supply chain security issues, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- The handling of credentials is optional and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are justified and aligned with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2 (average ~0.15)  \n\nThis reflects a safe, legitimate implementation with no malicious intent.",
