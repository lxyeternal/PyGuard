{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers (version 4 and 5) for asynchronous network connections, including negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports for connection and credentials (username, password) for SOCKS5 authentication.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets during connection negotiation, including potentially sensitive credentials in SOCKS5 username/password authentication.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and credentials flow into connection and authentication processes, potentially leading to transmission of sensitive data over network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. The code performs standard SOCKS protocol operations. No obfuscated or misleading code structures detected. No use of insecure environment variables or insecure data handling identified. Data leakage or malicious behavior is not evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. It handles address resolution, connection establishment, and protocol negotiation, including optional username/password authentication. It carefully manages socket communication, including proper exception handling for connection issues. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network behaviors are present. The code performs expected network proxy functions without data exfiltration or backdoors. The structure, variable names, and methods align with typical proxy client implementations. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly manages network connections and credentials, with no signs of data leakage or backdoors.",
