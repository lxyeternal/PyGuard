  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is protocol-compliant, clean, and free of malicious behavior. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard protocol implementation, no suspicious code, and proper error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's structure. No issues found, and the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) compared to others, but still reasonable given the context. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Also confirms a standard, secure implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Code and Reports:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. The code strictly implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with proper error handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** No, credentials are passed as parameters.\n- **Suspicious network activity:** None; standard proxy negotiation and address resolution.\n- **Malware or backdoors:** Not present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware scores** are correctly set at 0 across all reports.\n- The **security risk scores** are generally low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- The **confidence levels** are high, consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 range is appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the evidence and the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, protocol-compliant SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
