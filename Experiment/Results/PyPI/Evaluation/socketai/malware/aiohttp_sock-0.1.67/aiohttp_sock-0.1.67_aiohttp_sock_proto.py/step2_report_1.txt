  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard proxy implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code matches the description: standard SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the code's purpose.\n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the report's conclusion.\n- The high confidence (0.9) seems justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code details in the report align with the actual code: proper address resolution, authentication, and connection handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified; no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Malware score remains 0, matching the report.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious activity, proper handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code supports SOCKS4/5, handles credentials securely if provided, and performs protocol-compliant operations.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable, perhaps considering the handling of credentials, but overall, the code does not introduce significant security risks.\n- Malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no backdoors or obfuscation, proper protocol handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is consistent with the description: standard socket operations, proper error handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk score is reasonable given the context.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears legitimate, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious data flows or backdoors.\n- The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering the code handles sensitive data (credentials), but does not leak or misuse it.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the reports and code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0 and 0.2, reflecting minor concerns over credential handling but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal security risk, primarily due to credential handling but no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no supply chain security threats.",
