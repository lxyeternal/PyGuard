{
  "purpose": "This code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "User or application provides destination host and port, and potentially authentication credentials; internal socket connection and DNS resolution functions read network data.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations send and receive data; address resolution functions interact with network resources; potential untrusted data flows include DNS resolution and socket communication.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (host, port, credentials) flow into socket connection and negotiation functions, which send data over network sockets; responses from servers are read and processed to establish connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. The code relies on standard socket operations and asynchronous patterns; no suspicious data manipulation or hidden behaviors observed. The import of errors module suggests exception handling, but no suspicious error handling present. The code uses typical network communication protocols and common libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with functions for resolving addresses, handling authentication, and establishing connections via proxy servers. It carefully manages socket operations, address resolution, and protocol-specific message formatting. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without any suspicious or malicious features. It does not perform any unexpected network activity beyond proxy negotiation and connection establishment, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity is detected. The code handles network operations securely with proper exception handling and does not contain signs of malware or security risks. Overall, the code is safe with a high confidence level.",
