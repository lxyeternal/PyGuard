  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication through proxies.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, destination address resolution, credential parameters (username, password).",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; address resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are used in address resolution and socket connection; data flows through socket send/recv methods during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; standard protocol handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, with proper error handling, optional credential support, and address resolution. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It handles network operations securely and efficiently, with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling, which is optional and managed securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low inherent risk.",
