  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential handling, which is optional and managed securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low inherent risk."
