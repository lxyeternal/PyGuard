{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous network communication through proxies with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, user credentials (username, password), and configuration options provided to class constructors and methods, especially in functions like _resolve_addr, negotiate, and connection requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through socket send operations, especially during the negotiate process (_send method), connection establishment, and authentication phases. Data is received via socket recv operations, including responses from proxy servers and address resolution results.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows from user-provided hostnames, ports, and credentials into socket connection and negotiation procedures. Data from these inputs is processed, potentially resolved remotely or locally, and then sent to the proxy server. Responses from proxy servers are read and checked for validity, controlling the connection flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. The code performs standard proxy negotiation and address resolution. No obfuscated code, or suspicious data manipulation is present. No indicators of backdoors or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized system access, are evident. Error handling appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements SOCKS proxy protocols with proper validation and error handling. It manages asynchronous socket communication, address resolution, and authentication in line with protocol specifications. No malicious behavior, such as data leakage, backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms, is apparent. The functions perform expected network operations and handle errors appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code performs protocol-compliant socket communication with proper error handling, indicating no supply chain security threats.",
