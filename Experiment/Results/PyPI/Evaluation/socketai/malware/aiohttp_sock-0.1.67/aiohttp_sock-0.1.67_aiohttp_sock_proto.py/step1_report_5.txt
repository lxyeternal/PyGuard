{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket communication, enabling connection to proxies and forwarding traffic through them.",
  "sources": "Input sources include host and port parameters, as well as address resolution functions (_resolve_addr). Data is read from socket responses (_receive method) during proxy negotiation and address reading. User credentials may be read if provided for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include socket send operations (_send, sendall methods) and data received from proxy responses (_receive). Data from address resolution could be manipulated if address resolution is compromised.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, credentials) is used in connection and authentication requests, which are sent over sockets. Responses from the proxy are processed to verify success and retrieve bind addresses. The flow includes input processing, socket communication, and response parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to perform standard proxy negotiation and connection handling. Use of socket module for network operations and standard authentication methods are typical. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous wrapper for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution. It follows standard protocols for proxy negotiation, with error handling for various socket and protocol errors. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or unauthorized data leaks are evident. The handling of user credentials is optional and properly used in authentication flows. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of proxy client wrappers without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asyncio. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity detected. The code functions as expected for its purpose without any signs of malware or security risks.",
