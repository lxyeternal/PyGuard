  "purpose": "Implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, and potentially user credentials (username, password). Data is read from network responses during negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for connecting to proxies and destination addresses; potential data leakage via network communication and unresolved address resolution.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> negotiate() -> _socks_connect()/ _socks_auth() -> network communication and address resolution -> establish proxy connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. The code strictly handles proxy communication protocols. No apparent backdoors or hidden behaviors. Use of exception handling to manage network errors is standard. No data exfiltration or malicious commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection handling with proper error management. It performs address resolution, supports both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with optional username/password authentication, and manages network I/O using asyncio loops. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network behaviors, or code anomalies are detected. The use of standard libraries and protocols aligns with legitimate proxy communication implementations. The code appears solely designed for proxy connectivity without any malicious payloads or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based network communication. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and logic follow established protocols without suspicious or harmful elements.",
