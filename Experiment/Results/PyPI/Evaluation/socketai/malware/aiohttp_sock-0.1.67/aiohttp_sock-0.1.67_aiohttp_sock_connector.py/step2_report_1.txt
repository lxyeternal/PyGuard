  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, the reasoning provided, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements a custom proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting various proxy types, URL parsing, optional DNS resolution, and socket wrapping.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL schemes, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code relies on user-provided parameters and standard URL formatting.\n- The socket wrapper and proxy URL generation are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are uniformly low (~0.2), and malware scores are zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **No malicious or harmful code detected.** The code is a typical proxy connector implementation.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.**\n- **No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.**\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- The only minor point is that the `proxy_url` property may include credentials in the URL, which is standard but should be handled securely in practice. However, this is not a flaw in the code itself, just a security consideration.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** all assign 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** scores are around 0.1-0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Overall risk:** low, as expected.\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The connection handling appears standard.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard proxy configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the given scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: approximately 0.1-0.2\n\n**The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws.**\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to proxy URL handling, but still very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the risk is minimal.",
