  "purpose": "Implements a customizable proxy connector for aiohttp supporting various proxy types, URL parsing, and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters, user-provided proxy URL, helper functions for URL parsing and socket creation.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL generation, socket connection establishment, request proxy updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> proxy_url property -> socket wrapper creation -> connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs proxy URLs dynamically, supports multiple proxy types, and manages socket connections appropriately. It uses helper functions that appear legitimate. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. Proxy credentials are handled via user input, which is standard but should be managed securely in deployment. The socket wrapper is used for non-HTTP proxies, aligning with typical proxy handling. The code is clear, modular, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and appropriate.",
