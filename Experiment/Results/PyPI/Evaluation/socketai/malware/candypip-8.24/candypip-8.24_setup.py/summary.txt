  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, backdoors, or system compromise. The package should be flagged as suspicious, and further analysis of the payload is recommended."
