  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from . import main`. There are no additional code lines, no data processing, no dynamic imports, no environment interactions, and no network activity. The code is minimal and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \n- No suspicious or unusual features are noted across all reports.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware behavior.\n\n3. **Error or Logical Flaws**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no issues or errors.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are present in this minimal code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**  \n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also zero, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, as the code is not obfuscated.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions**  \n- All reports correctly assume benign intent based solely on the code snippet.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits that are unsupported by the code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0**. No security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\nGiven the minimal nature of the code, there is no reason to adjust the scores. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard import statement with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
