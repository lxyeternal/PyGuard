  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or input mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module without further data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.
