  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no sinks identified in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; import statement does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional logic. No suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports 'main' from the current package. This is a standard practice in Python packages to organize code into modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code is too minimal to perform any malicious action on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a common pattern used in Python modules to include submodules.",
