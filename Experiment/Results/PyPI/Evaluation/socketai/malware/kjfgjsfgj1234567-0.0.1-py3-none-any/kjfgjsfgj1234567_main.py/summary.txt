  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 1,
  "confidence": 1,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, employing high levels of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and indirect control flow to hide payloads. The presence of eval/exec with encoded strings and the complex nested lambda functions confirm malicious behavior. The scores assigned—malware: 1, obfuscated: 1, security risk: 1—are justified based on these observations."
