  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, primarily for covert data exfiltration via DNS tunneling. It collects sensitive system information, encodes it, and transmits it to a suspicious domain, which is characteristic of malicious exfiltration tools. The activity during package installation increases the supply chain risk. The malware score is justified at 0.9, with a security risk score around 0.85, indicating high threat potential."
