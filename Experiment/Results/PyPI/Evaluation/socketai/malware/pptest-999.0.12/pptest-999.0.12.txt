      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, primarily for covert data exfiltration via DNS tunneling. It collects sensitive system information, encodes it, and transmits it to a suspicious domain, which is characteristic of malicious exfiltration tools. The activity during package installation increases the supply chain risk. The malware score is justified at 0.9, with a security risk score around 0.85, indicating high threat potential."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration via DNS queries, which is suspicious and potentially malicious in certain contexts. It does not contain destructive payloads or obfuscation. The activity warrants security attention, but the code itself is straightforward and not inherently malware. The primary risk is data theft or reconnaissance using DNS tunneling techniques."
