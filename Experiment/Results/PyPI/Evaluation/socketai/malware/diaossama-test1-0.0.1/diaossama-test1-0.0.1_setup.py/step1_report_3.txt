  "purpose": "The script appears to collect system information and send it to a remote server, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os, platform, socket; collecting local login name; obtaining IP address; constructing and encoding data string.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP GET request to an external IP address (162.62.15.24), transmitting potentially sensitive system info.",
  "flows": "System info is collected, formatted into a string, encoded in base64, then sent via a GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes direct IP-based data exfiltration, encoding system info, and sending it to a suspicious IP without any clear legitimate purpose. The code also imports modules like subprocess and re but does not use them.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, some unused, indicating possible obfuscation or incomplete code. It gathers system details including hostname, current user login, and IP address. The data is concatenated into a string, base64 encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to an IP address not associated with legitimate domains. This behavior resembles data exfiltration typical in malware. The presence of hardcoded IP and the manner of collecting sensitive information suggest malicious intent. No benign use case is evident, and the code operates without user consent or disclosure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and transmit it to a remote IP address, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It resembles data exfiltration behavior often seen in malware. The overall intent appears to be covert data gathering, with no legitimate reason for such actions within a normal package setup script.",
