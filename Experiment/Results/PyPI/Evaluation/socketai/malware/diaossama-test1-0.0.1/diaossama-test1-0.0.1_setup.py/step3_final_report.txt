{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current user, OS details, current directory, external IP), encodes it in base64, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address, likely for malicious reconnaissance or data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os, platform, socket, and os.getlogin(); obtaining external IP through socket connection.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded data via requests.get() to external IP address 162.62.15.24.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from sources, encoded in base64, then transmitted over the network to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during package setup, use of socket to determine external IP, transmission to suspicious IP, no user consent or validation, all occurring outside typical setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of sensitive system data, encodes it, and sends it to an external IP address during package setup, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The use of socket to determine external IP and immediate transmission without user knowledge confirms malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the network activity is embedded in a setup script, a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The high confidence scores (0.9) for malware and security risk are justified given the clear exfiltration behavior. The data transmitted could compromise user privacy and system security, warranting a high security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. The activity is suspicious, deliberate, and potentially harmful, confirming high malware and security risk levels. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is clearly malicious.",
