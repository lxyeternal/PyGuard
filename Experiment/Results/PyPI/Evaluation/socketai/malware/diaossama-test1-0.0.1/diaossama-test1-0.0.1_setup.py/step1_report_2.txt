  "purpose": "The code appears to gather system and network information, encode it, and send it to a remote server, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket connection to determine IP address",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to a remote IP address",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> encode in base64 -> send via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Use of socket to obtain external IP address, encoding system info, and sending data to a suspicious IP address without user consent; no clear legitimate purpose for these actions in a package setup script",
  "analysis": "The code collects various system details and the current IP address by creating a socket connection to 8.8.8.8. It then concatenates these details into a string, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (162.62.15.24). This behavior is suspicious in the context of a package setup script, which normally does not perform network communication or data exfiltration. The code does not use the collected data for setup purposes and appears designed to secretly transmit system information. The use of hardcoded IP addresses and system information collection indicates potential malicious intent, possibly to identify infected or targeted systems. The inclusion of such network activity during package installation could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system data and sending it to a remote server without user consent, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The activity is not related to the package setup process and indicates a backdoor or tracking mechanism.",
