  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; network communication points; file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system writes, environment variable access, data serialization or transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data originating from sources (inputs, env vars) flowing into network calls, file writes, or other sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, unusual import patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal or benign, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Input sources are standard, and sinks are typical for data processing. No obfuscation techniques are detected, and code structure appears straightforward. The confidence scores reflect the limited context, and the malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators. Risk scores are low, with slight increases where input validation concerns are noted, aligning with cautious security assessment practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippets do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk assessments are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on these reports is benign, with low likelihood of malicious activity.",
