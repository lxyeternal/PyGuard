  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, network requests, dynamic code execution (exec/eval), hardcoded URLs, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication points, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, file operations, command injections.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution or network requests, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious control.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variables, dynamic code execution, hardcoded URLs, suspicious command injections, unusual control flow, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code with dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, and obfuscation indicates suspicious patterns consistent with malicious intent. Benign code lacks these indicators. Scores reflect suspicion levels: 0.5 malware, 0.6 obfuscation, 0.65 risk for Report 1; zero scores for benign reports. The suspicion in Report 1 is justified by the described patterns, while others are benign. Confidence scores are high where code is absent or benign. No false positives identified; scoring aligns with observed patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 shows moderate suspicious activity justified by dynamic execution and obfuscation, warranting a malware score of 0.5 and obfuscation of 0.6. Other reports are benign with appropriate zero or low scores. Overall, the assessment is consistent; no adjustments necessary unless further code details reveal more malicious indicators.",
