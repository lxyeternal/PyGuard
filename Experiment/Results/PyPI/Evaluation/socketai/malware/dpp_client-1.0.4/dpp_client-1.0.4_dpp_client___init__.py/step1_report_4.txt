{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, but without specific comments or documentation, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly specified; the code does not read from external files, environment variables, or network sources directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly evident; the code does not seem to write to files, transmit data over the network, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observable; the code mainly performs internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are identified. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard operations such as list comprehensions, mathematical calculations, and function definitions. It does not utilize external data sources, nor does it perform any network operations or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
