  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent visible.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; the code does not read from external inputs, files, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "No vulnerable sinks such as system commands, network transmissions, or data exfiltration points are observed.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code seems to perform basic operations without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code features are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, unobfuscated script without external data sources, malicious code patterns, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not raise suspicion. The overall structure and content do not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
