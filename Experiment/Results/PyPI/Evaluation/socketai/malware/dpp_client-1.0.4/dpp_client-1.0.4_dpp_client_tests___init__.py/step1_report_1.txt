  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, possibly involving network or system operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or system command execution where untrusted data might be used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input or environment sources to processing functions, then potentially to network or file system sinks, depending on the code structure.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation patterns detected. No unusual dynamic code execution observed. Any suspicious variable names or unnecessary complexity are minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard structure with normal imports and functions. No signs of malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft routines. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. There are no indicators of malicious behavior like hidden backdoors or malicious environmental manipulations. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious language features. Overall, the code looks benign with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no security risks identified.",
