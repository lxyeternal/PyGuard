  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network interactions, file operations, dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into dynamic execution or data transmission sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious activity in benign reports, with scores reflecting no obfuscation or malware. Suspicious reports show obfuscation (scores ~0.6-0.7), dynamic execution, and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with higher suspicion in reports 4 and 5. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, so malware scores remain moderate. The overall risk is balanced, with low scores in benign cases and moderate in suspicious ones.",
  "conclusion": "The code generally appears benign in most reports, with some suspicion in reports 4 and 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic behaviors. Scores are appropriate and reflect the level of suspicion. Slight adjustments could increase malware scores in the more suspicious reports if further evidence emerges.",
