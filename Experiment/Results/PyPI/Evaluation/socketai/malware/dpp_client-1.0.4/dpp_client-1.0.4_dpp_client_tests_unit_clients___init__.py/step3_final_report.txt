  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, user input.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, subprocess execution, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, suspicious data flows, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on descriptions indicating benign, standard scripts. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious but reasonable assessments. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified. The reasoning aligns with the absence of code, and the scores are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and accurate, indicating the code is benign with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on these assessments is low risk.",
