  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods: event_type, event_data, timestamp, timeout, logger",
  "sinks": "Logging output (logger.debug) potentially exposing sensitive info if misused; abstract method _send_event (implementation-dependent)",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into validation and logging, then into the abstract _send_event method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; the code uses standard practices for an abstract client",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract client class with validation and logging. It validates event type and timestamp, and logs event details before delegating to an abstract method. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or suspicious flows are present. The class is designed for extensibility without embedded malicious actions or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured abstract class for event handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for legitimate use.",
