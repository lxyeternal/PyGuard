  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging features",
  "sources": "Input parameters: event_type, event_data, timestamp, logger, timeout",
  "sinks": "Logging statements that output event details including event data and timestamp",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used in logging and passed to _send_event method",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for validating event types and timestamps, and for sending events with logging. No external data sources or sinks pose security threats. Logging does not include sensitive data explicitly, and there are no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class for event handling with proper validation and logging. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
