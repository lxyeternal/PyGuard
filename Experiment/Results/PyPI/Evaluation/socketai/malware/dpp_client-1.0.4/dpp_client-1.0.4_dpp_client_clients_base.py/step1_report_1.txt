  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (event_type, timeout, logger), method parameters (event_data, event_type, timestamp, timeout, logger)",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not directly write untrusted data to files, network, or sensitive locations",
  "flows": "send_event method validates and logs event data, then calls _send_event (abstract) to process the event",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for event handling with input validation, logging, and method placeholders. It uses standard libraries and best practices for validation and logging. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured base class for event handling without malicious intent or security risks.",
