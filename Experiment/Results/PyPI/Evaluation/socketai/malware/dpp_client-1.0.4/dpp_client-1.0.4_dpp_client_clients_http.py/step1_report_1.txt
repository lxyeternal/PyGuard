  "purpose": "Define a client class for sending event data to a specified endpoint using HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "endpoint (input parameter), timestamp (formatted in _format_timestamp), event_type, event_data (passed to _send_event).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to self.endpoint with JSON payload containing event data.",
  "flows": "Data from event_data, event_type, and timestamp flow into the JSON payload, which is sent via POST request to the endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; standard usage of requests library; no malicious system calls.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes an HTTP session, formats timestamps, and sends event data via POST requests. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. Usage of requests.Session and mounting adapters appears normal. The code does not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to injection or leaks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a client for sending event data to a specified endpoint securely. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk is low.",
