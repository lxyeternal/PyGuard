  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard event reporting client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security concern is external control of the 'endpoint' parameter, which could be exploited if malicious. Scores are consistent with this analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). No modifications to the scores are necessary."
