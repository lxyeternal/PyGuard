      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk malicious behavior through encrypted payload decryption and runtime execution during installation, characteristic of supply chain sabotage or backdoors. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be flagged as malicious until further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms safety."
