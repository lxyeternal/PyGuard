{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'libwebp' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The collected system information is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL (ngrok.io).",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username are collected and then sent over the network to a remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to a remote server without user consent, and embedding the request within a setup script's install process. The request URL is obfuscated with an ngrok tunnel, which can be used for command and control or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running, gathers sensitive system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of merely installing the package, it performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating data. The URL is an ngrok tunnel, which is commonly used for exposing local servers or hiding command and control channels. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially because it operates silently during the setup process. No other malicious activity like code execution or backdoors is evident, but the intentional data sending is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script secretly transmits system information to a remote server during installation, which is indicative of malicious intent or data theft. The package appears to be designed to exfiltrate user system data without explicit consent, constituting malicious behavior.",
