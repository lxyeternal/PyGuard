{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is collected (source) and sent over the network (sink) through requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded external URL (ngrok.io) for data exfiltration during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and extends the installation command. During the run method of CustomInstall, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends these details to an external server via a GET request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration embedded within a package installation process. The external URL appears malicious, and the use of ngrok suggests an attacker-controlled endpoint. No other suspicious code, such as backdoors or hidden malicious functions, is present. The package itself appears benign on the surface but performs malicious activity during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended to exfiltrate user system information during package installation without user consent. The external URL and the collection of user info indicate a security risk. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
