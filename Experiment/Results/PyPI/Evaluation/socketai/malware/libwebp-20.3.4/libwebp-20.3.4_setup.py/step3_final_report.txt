{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, indicating malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "The data is read from socket (hostname), os (current directory), and getpass (username) during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends the collected data to an external URL, acting as the sink for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source variables (hostname, cwd, username) to the requests.get() call, which transmits it to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, using a hardcoded suspicious URL (ngrok.io). The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, but the activity is covert and malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system info and sends it to an external URL, indicating malicious intent. The URL is suspicious (ngrok tunnel), and the activity occurs silently during package setup. The code is clear and un-obfuscated, with no benign purpose for such exfiltration. The data flow from system info sources to the external sink confirms malicious behavior. The author comment and use of a hidden URL further support malicious intent. The behavior constitutes covert data theft, posing a high security and privacy risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, with no user consent, using a suspicious external URL. It is clearly malicious, warranting a maximum malware score and security risk score.",
