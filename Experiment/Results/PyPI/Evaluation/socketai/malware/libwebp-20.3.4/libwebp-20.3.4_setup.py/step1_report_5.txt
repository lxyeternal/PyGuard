  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL with collected system data",
  "flows": "During installation, the code gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded URL (via ngrok), collection of system info during install without user consent, no indication of user notification or opt-out, and potential privacy violation",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package installation. A custom install class overrides run(), collecting hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after installation begins, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL (ngrok.io domain), which is often used for temporary or malicious tunnels. This behavior is hidden within the install process, with no user awareness or consent. The data collection and transmission during install, especially to a third-party URL, indicate potential malicious intent or privacy violation. No other malicious activities (like code injection, data exfiltration beyond info gathering) are evident, but the intent to surreptitiously transmit system info is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a covert collection and transmission of system information during package installation, indicating malicious behavior or privacy risk. The use of a dynamic, potentially malicious URL (ngrok) supports this conclusion. Overall, this code is malicious or maliciously intended.",
