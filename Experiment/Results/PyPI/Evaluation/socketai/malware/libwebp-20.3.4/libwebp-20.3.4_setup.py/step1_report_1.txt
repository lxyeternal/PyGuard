  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Code reads hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during package installation.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username flows from source to the requests.get call, which acts as a sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server during installation without user consent. The URL used is an ngrok tunnel, which is often used to hide malicious command-and-control activity. The author comment includes a suspicious handle 'hackerone.com/mega7'. The code's primary purpose appears to be surveillance or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard package installation process by subclassing 'install' and overriding the 'run' method. During execution, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username—potentially sensitive data—and sends it to an external URL using requests.get. The URL points to an ngrok tunnel, which is often used to create a persistent external access point. No other security features or safeguards are present. The code lacks any validation, obfuscation, or clear legitimate purpose for collecting and transmitting system info. Given the context, this behavior appears malicious, likely intended for data exfiltration or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a malicious data exfiltration mechanism embedded within a package installation script. It collects system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The use of an ngrok URL and author comment suggests suspicious or malicious activity.",
