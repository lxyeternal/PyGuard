{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'libwebp' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external URL ('https://49b8-156-205-125-10.eu.ngrok.io') with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (hostname, cwd, username) to the requests.get() call, which sends data over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates system information to an external server during installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded ngrok URL is also suspicious, indicating possible command-and-control or data exfiltration activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, gathers system information and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior occurs transparently during package installation, which is malicious because it exfiltrates user system data without disclosure. The URL used is an ngrok endpoint, commonly used to tunnel local servers, often for malicious C2 or exfiltration. There are no other suspicious code obfuscations or malicious payloads; the main concern is the unauthorized data transmission during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. The rest of the package setup code is standard, but this hidden behavior makes the package dangerous to use.",
