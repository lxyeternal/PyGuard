  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, and malware scores are zero across all reports. The only necessary adjustment was lowering Report 4's security risk from 0.3 to 0.1 due to lack of evidence. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified."
