  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package that performs a specific function, possibly related to data processing or utility operations, based on standard import statements and function definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs, possibly from environment variables or external files, although no explicit input sources are shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file I/O, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or parameters through processing functions to outputs or external interactions; specific flows cannot be identified without additional code context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard imports and functions with no signs of malicious patterns. There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, network calls, or file manipulations. The code structure appears conventional, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior. Absence of direct data leaks or malicious payloads indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malicious activities detected. Confidence is high that this code is safe in its current form.",
