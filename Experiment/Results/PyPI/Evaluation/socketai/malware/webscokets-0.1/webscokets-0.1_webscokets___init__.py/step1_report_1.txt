  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple utility or module, but without specific comments or context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, standard input, or external modules (if any are used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or system commands, depending on the code's logic, but no explicit sinks are visible without further context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions, and possibly to output or external calls, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. However, incomplete code snippet limits full analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code was either not provided or is missing. Based on the prompt, no actual code was supplied for review. Given no code to analyze, no malicious behavior or security issues can be identified. The lack of code prevents detection of suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to perform a thorough review due to absence of code. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks can be determined without analyzing specific code content.",
