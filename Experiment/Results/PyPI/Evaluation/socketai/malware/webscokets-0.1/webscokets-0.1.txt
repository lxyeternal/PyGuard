      "conclusion": "Most reports are appropriately cautious given the lack of code, with Report 4 indicating moderate suspicion due to described obfuscation and dynamic behaviors. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 4 from 0.4 to 0.6 improves alignment with its described suspicious traits. Overall, the scoring is reasonable and consistent with the provided analyses."
