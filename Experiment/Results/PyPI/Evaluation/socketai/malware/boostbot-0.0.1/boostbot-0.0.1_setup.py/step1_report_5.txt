{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package with custom installation and development commands, including downloading and executing an external script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md', reads the user's system username via getpass, and retrieves the current timestamp with time.time(). It also downloads a file from a remote URL using requests.",
  "sinks": "The remote URL is used to download and execute a file ('install.bat') through os.system, which runs the batch file potentially containing malicious code.",
  "flows": "User/system data (like username and timestamp) are gathered but not used maliciously. The primary flow of concern is the download of 'install.bat' from an external server and its execution via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an external script from a Discord CDN URL and executes it without validation or user consent, which is highly suspicious. The URL uses HTTPS but is possibly malicious, and executing arbitrary downloaded files is a major security concern. There is no validation or integrity check for the downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package but includes a function 'execute()' that downloads a batch script from a remote server and executes it immediately. The remote URL points to a Discord CDN, which is commonly used to host malicious payloads in supply chain attacks. The script runs this batch file using 'os.system', which could execute arbitrary, potentially malicious commands. The use of 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start install.bat' suggests an attempt to run the batch file with elevated or bypassed permissions, increasing risk. There are no checks, validation, or obfuscation, and the code's intent to run external code is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external script from an untrusted source without validation, which is a serious security risk. The overall risk score is high due to the execution of external, potentially malicious content. The code should not be used or distributed as-is.",
