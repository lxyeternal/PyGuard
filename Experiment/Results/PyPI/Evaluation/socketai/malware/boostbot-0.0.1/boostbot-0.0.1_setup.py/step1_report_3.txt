{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package called 'boostbot' and execute a remote script during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads a URL to download a file (`install.bat`) from a Discord CDN link. It also reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded `install.bat` is executed using `os.system`, which can run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code flows from fetching the remote BAT file via HTTP request to executing it with `os.system`, which can run malicious commands if the downloaded file is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a batch script from an external URL during setup is highly suspicious; the URL is from a Discord CDN, which is unusual for legitimate software distribution. The script bypasses usual safety checks and directly executes potentially untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a function `execute()` that performs a GET request to a Discord CDN URL and saves the response as 'install.bat'. It then runs the batch file with `os.system`. This behavior during setup or development commands can execute arbitrary, possibly malicious, code on the user's system. The URL used is suspicious, and the script’s purpose appears to be executing remote code without validation or user consent. There are no other obvious malicious behaviors or obfuscated code. The setup script’s core malicious activity is the remote code download and execution, which could be used to install malware or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote batch script during setup or development installation. This is a significant security risk, as it can run arbitrary code from an external source, which may be malicious. The code is straightforward but dangerous, and the URL indicates potential malicious intent.",
