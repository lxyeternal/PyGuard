      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating malicious activity likely aimed at remote code execution or data exfiltration. The external URL, obfuscation, and silent execution justify high malware and security risk scores. The package setup appears legitimate but is compromised by embedded malicious behavior. It should be flagged for further investigation and possibly removed from distribution channels."
