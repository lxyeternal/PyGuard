  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during package setup. The use of silent error handling and conditional execution further supports this. Scores of malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.85) are justified. Immediate decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended to confirm malicious intent, and the code should be removed or sandboxed until verified."
