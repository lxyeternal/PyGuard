      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates clear malicious behavior, including active external data fetching with suspicious headers, environment variable exploitation for dynamic URL construction, execution of embedded Python code via os.system, and writing potentially sensitive data into files during package installation. These patterns are characteristic of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.9 and security risk near 1—are justified and reflect the high severity of the threat. This package should be flagged and rejected in supply chain contexts to prevent system compromise."

      "conclusion": "The detailed code analysis indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity in the described script, justified by dynamic code execution, external communication, and suspicious patterns. Scores are consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary; the high malware and risk scores for the suspicious report are appropriate, while benign reports are correctly scored low."
