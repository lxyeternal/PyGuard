{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that performs network requests and system commands during package installation, potentially to retrieve external resources or manipulate the environment.",
  "sources": "Network requests to external URLs, environment variables, and system commands executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Printing request responses to LICENSE file, executing system commands that fetch external data, creating files, and modifying environment variables.",
  "flows": "From network request sources (URLs and environment variables) through os.system commands that fetch and save data to files, including remote code execution via embedded Python code in system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs and headers with basic auth, fetching data from external sites, executing system commands with dynamically constructed URLs and request parameters, and potential environmental variable manipulation. The commented-out code hints at further malicious activities like data exfiltration or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that overrides the run method, performing multiple network requests using embedded Python code via os.system calls. These requests fetch potentially sensitive data (e.g., a PEM file and content from environment-based URLs) and write outputs to a LICENSE file. The use of hardcoded URLs, headers with basic auth, and environment variables suggests attempts at data exfiltration or malicious control. The code also creates a temporary file (/tmp/pytest2). The commented code and the embedded Python commands in os.system calls resemble attempts to obfuscate or hide malicious intent, but the current active code executes external requests and stores data, which could be malicious. Overall, the code has high potential for malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and environmental manipulation, during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious network activity, hardcoded sensitive URLs, and execution of dynamic Python code through os.system, indicating malicious intent. It appears designed to exfiltrate data or compromise the environment during installation, representing a security risk.",
