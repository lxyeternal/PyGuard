  "purpose": "Custom setup script that executes network requests and system commands during package installation, possibly to gather information or execute malicious code.",
  "sources": "Network requests to external URLs, environment variables (EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR, EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST), and file system (creating LICENSE file, touching /tmp/pytest2).",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via os.system(), writing data to LICENSE, creating files, and potential data exfiltration through network requests.",
  "flows": "During installation, code executes system commands that fetch data from remote servers and environment variables, then writes responses into a file named LICENSE. Also creates a temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with concatenated strings for executing HTTP requests and downloading content from potentially malicious or unknown external URLs. Use of environment variables for constructing URLs. Commented-out code suggests prior or potential malicious activity. Repeated network requests with authorization headers. Downloading and executing remote content. Unusual code execution during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command in setup.py to perform network requests and system commands during package installation. It retrieves data from external URLs, some with embedded authorization headers, and writes the responses into a file called LICENSE. It also uses environment variables to construct URLs for network access, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code installs the 'requests' library if not present and then makes multiple HTTP GET requests, sometimes with custom headers, to remote servers. It creates files and touches system directories, potentially indicating data collection or backdoor activity. The use of os.system() with concatenated strings makes it prone to injection or command execution issues. Commented code suggests possible previous or intended malicious activity, such as exfiltration or remote command execution. Overall, the code demonstrates behaviors typical of malicious supply chain attacks, including remote data fetching, environment-based URL generation, and file manipulation during package install, which are common tactics for persistence, data exfiltration, or backdoor setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious intent by executing remote code and data collection during package installation, with behaviors resembling a backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism. Its use of environment variables, untrusted URLs, and system commands during setup makes it highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. It should be considered malicious or compromised for supply chain attacks.",
