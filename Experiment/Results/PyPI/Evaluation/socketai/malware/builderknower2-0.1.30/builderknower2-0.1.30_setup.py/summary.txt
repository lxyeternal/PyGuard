  "security_risk": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates clear malicious behavior, including active external data fetching with suspicious headers, environment variable exploitation for dynamic URL construction, execution of embedded Python code via os.system, and writing potentially sensitive data into files during package installation. These patterns are characteristic of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.9 and security risk near 1—are justified and reflect the high severity of the threat. This package should be flagged and rejected in supply chain contexts to prevent system compromise."
