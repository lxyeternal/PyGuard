  "purpose": "Customize the package installation process by executing potentially malicious commands during setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR, EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST), hardcoded URLs, pip install requests, inline Python code execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing shell commands that perform network requests and file operations, including writing to LICENSE file, creating files, and making requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL construction -> os.system calls executing Python requests code -> writing data to files.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of os.system to execute Python code that makes HTTP requests with suspicious headers and URLs, creating files with fetched content, and environment variable-based URL generation. Many lines are commented or redundant, indicating obfuscation or concealment of malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run custom code that fetches external data from multiple URLs, some with suspicious headers, and writes responses to LICENSE files. It installs 'requests' library before making HTTP requests. The URLs include known malicious or suspicious domains, and the requests are executed with custom headers suggesting credential or token theft attempts. Environment variables are used to construct URLs dynamically, possibly for command and control communication. The code also creates a dummy file (/tmp/pytest2) and contains commented-out code that hints at further data exfiltration. The multiple network requests and dynamic URL construction combined with attempts to hide or obfuscate behavior indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by executing external requests to suspicious URLs with crafted headers, collecting and storing data during installation, and using environment variables for dynamic URL generation. The use of inline Python code executed via os.system to perform HTTP requests, combined with installing the 'requests' library within the setup process, strongly suggests an embedded backdoor or supply chain attack intended to exfiltrate data or compromise systems. The overall pattern indicates high malicious intent.",
