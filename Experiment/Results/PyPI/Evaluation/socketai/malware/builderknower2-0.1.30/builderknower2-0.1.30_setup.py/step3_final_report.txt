    "Commented-out functions and code indicating prior malicious intent or obfuscation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code installs the 'requests' library dynamically, then uses embedded Python code via os.system to perform HTTP GET requests to external URLs, some with authorization headers. These responses are redirected into files like LICENSE and /tmp/pytest2, suggesting data exfiltration or reconnaissance. Environment variables are used to construct URLs, which can be manipulated for malicious control. The repeated pattern of executing Python code within os.system calls, combined with writing responses into files, indicates malicious intent such as backdoors, data theft, or remote command execution. The code's structure and behavior align with known supply chain attack tactics, and the use of commented-out functions and complex string concatenations further suggest obfuscation efforts. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious potential and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates clear malicious behavior, including active external data fetching with suspicious headers, environment variable exploitation for dynamic URL construction, execution of embedded Python code via os.system, and writing potentially sensitive data into files during package installation. These patterns are characteristic of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.9 and security risk near 1—are justified and reflect the high severity of the threat. This package should be flagged and rejected in supply chain contexts to prevent system compromise.",
