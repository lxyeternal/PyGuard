  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the function is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function with no external dependencies, inputs, or outputs. It contains no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
