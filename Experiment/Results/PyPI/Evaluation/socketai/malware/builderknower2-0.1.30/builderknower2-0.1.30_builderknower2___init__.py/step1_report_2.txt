  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python script that performs some form of data processing or network communication based on the imported modules.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, possibly from input functions or external files, but these are not clearly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, data transmissions, or file writes, but specific functions or methods are not visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, it's unclear if there are any source-to-sink data flows; the snippet does not reveal explicit data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected. The code appears straightforward but incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal and lacks detailed implementation. It does not contain any malicious functions, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The code's structure and imports suggest standard functionality, but due to the limited snippet, the assessment cannot confirm any malicious intent. No anomalies or security issues are evident from the partial code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to its incomplete nature, a low confidence level is maintained. More context or full code is needed for a definitive assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
