  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, strongly indicating malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the high severity. Overall, this package should be flagged as malicious and removed from the supply chain."
