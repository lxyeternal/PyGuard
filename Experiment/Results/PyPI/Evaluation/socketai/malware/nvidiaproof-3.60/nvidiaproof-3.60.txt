      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The use of encoding, silent execution, and error suppression indicates concealment of potentially harmful actions. While the package setup appears legitimate, the embedded payload warrants suspicion and further analysis."
