      "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command triggered conditionally, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is compromised by embedded malicious behavior. The high scores are justified, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for confirmation."
