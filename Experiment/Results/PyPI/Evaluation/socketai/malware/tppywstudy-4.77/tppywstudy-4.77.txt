      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package setup. The obfuscation, stealth flags, and silent error handling support a high security risk. All reports correctly identify these indicators; I recommend considering the malware score at approximately 0.85 and the overall security risk at 0.9, reflecting the high threat level. Further decoding of the payload is advised for definitive analysis."
