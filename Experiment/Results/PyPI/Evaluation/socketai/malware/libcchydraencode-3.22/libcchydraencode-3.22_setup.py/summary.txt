  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, conditional execution of a PowerShell payload, with red flags indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and suspicious comments justify a high security risk. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until further payload analysis confirms benignity."
