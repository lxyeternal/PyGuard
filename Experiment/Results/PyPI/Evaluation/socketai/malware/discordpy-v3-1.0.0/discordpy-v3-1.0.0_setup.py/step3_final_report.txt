  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt' files for long description; static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' and 'install_requires' fields; 'install_requires' contains an empty string, which is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The empty 'url' and 'install_requires' are configuration oversights but do not introduce security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and no signals indicate malicious intent. The minor irregularities are common oversights rather than security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only irregularities are the empty 'url' and 'install_requires' entries, which are not security concerns but should be addressed for completeness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
