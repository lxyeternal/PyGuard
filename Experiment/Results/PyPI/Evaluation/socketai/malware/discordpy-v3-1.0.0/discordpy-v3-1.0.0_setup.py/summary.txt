  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only irregularities are the empty 'url' and 'install_requires' entries, which are not security concerns but should be addressed for completeness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
