{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data theft, including stealing tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating the collected data to a remote server or webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads user input and data from browser storage files, local state files, log/ldb files, and application directories. Also reads environment variables, system information, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and upload services. Executes system commands for process termination and file copying. Writes malicious payloads into Discord app files (injection).",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser files, system info, and token logs are collected, decrypted, and stored in variables. These variables are then formatted into JSON payloads and sent over HTTP to remote servers. Some files are zipped and uploaded, then links are shared. System commands are used to kill processes or copy files. The code injects malicious scripts into Discord files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses system-level API calls to decrypt Windows DPAPI encrypted data, injects malicious code into Discord installation files, installs packages via os.system(), includes obfuscated class names and methods with no clear functionality, and defines multiple large classes with placeholder-like methods that do nothing or return self. The code attempts to persist by copying itself into startup folders. The presence of extensive, suspiciously obfuscated class structures suggests potential obfuscation or malware.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a credential, token, cookies, and file stealer targeting browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows APIs, extracts tokens via regex, and collects user data. It also injects malicious code into Discord desktop core files to facilitate remote code execution or further control. The script kills processes related to Discord, Chrome, and other apps, likely to prevent interference. It uploads collected data to remote servers using requests and transfer.sh-like services. The code also has extensive class structures with no meaningful implementation, likely obfuscation or placeholder code. Additionally, it installs third-party packages automatically, which could be malicious if the packages are compromised or used to further malicious goals.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is malicious. It is designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data, tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from multiple applications, injects malicious scripts into Discord for potential remote code execution, kills related processes to avoid detection, and persistently copies itself into startup folders. Its obfuscated structure and injection techniques strongly indicate malicious intent, fitting the profile of malware aimed at comprehensive system compromise and data theft.",
