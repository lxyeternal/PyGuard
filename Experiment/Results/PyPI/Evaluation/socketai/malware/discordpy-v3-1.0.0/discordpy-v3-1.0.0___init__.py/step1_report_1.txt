{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious data theft, including stealing tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from the user's system, then exfiltrating this data via Discord webhooks or file hosting services. It also includes payload injection, process killing, and self-replication to persistence locations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., getpass.getuser, os.getenv), local files (e.g., browser storage, Discord data, Steam, Steam Wallet, Riot, Riot client, Telegram), and network requests (e.g., Discord API, geolocation API, webhook URLs). It also reads process lists and system info for victim identification.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include requests to Discord webhooks, requests to file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), local file writing (e.g., password, cookies, tokens, zip files), process termination commands, and self-copying to startup folder for persistence.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (browser profiles, login data, cookies, tokens) through extraction functions, then is encrypted/decrypted, stored temporarily, and uploaded to external servers. The code injects malicious payloads into Discord client files, kills related processes, and sends collected data via webhooks. Zipped data archives are uploaded for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, self-replication into startup folder, installation of third-party modules at runtime without verification, extensive obfuscated class/method naming, and the inclusion of numerous classes with nonsensical, repetitive, or placeholder methods. The code also forcibly terminates processes like Discord, possibly to prevent interference with malicious activities. Use of requests for network operations and process management indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with environment checks against blacklists to evade detection. It installs and imports multiple libraries (requests, Crypto), then proceeds to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browser profiles, Steam, Riot, and Telegram directories. It encrypts/decrypts data as needed, and uploads the results to external hosting services, with links sent via Discord webhook. It injects malicious JavaScript payloads into Discord installations. Many classes and functions with obfuscated or nonsensical names, serving no clear legitimate purpose, suggest code concealment. Process management commands kill Discord processes to prevent interference, indicating sabotage of the user environment. Self-copying to startup ensures persistence. The overall pattern indicates a comprehensive info-stealer and backdoor malware targeting various applications and system data, exfiltrating via multiple channels.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is malicious in nature, designed explicitly to extract tokens, credentials, cookies, and files, then exfiltrate via webhooks and file hosting. It employs obfuscation, process termination, payload injection, and persistence mechanisms. The code's structure and behavior confirm it is malware aimed at system compromise and data theft.",
