{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be creating a package setup configuration with benign metadata but contains embedded malicious activity that downloads and executes files from external sources.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe), file system modifications, and process executions.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to disk, renaming files, executing downloaded files with os.startfile, and deleting directories.",
  "flows": "Requests fetch executable files from external URLs -> files are written locally -> files are renamed and executed -> the directory is removed.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded code that downloads and executes potentially malicious executables, hardcoded URLs, creation of hidden directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), and immediate execution of downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes standard package metadata, which alone is benign. However, the code following the setup configuration downloads two executables from external URLs, saves them to a system directory with a disguised name, and executes them without any user consent or verification. The directory created appears to be a hidden or system directory, suggesting an attempt to hide activity. These behaviors are typical of malware intent, such as remote payload delivery and execution. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior, including downloading, hiding, and executing external payloads without user consent. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious malware embedded in a seemingly benign setup script.",
