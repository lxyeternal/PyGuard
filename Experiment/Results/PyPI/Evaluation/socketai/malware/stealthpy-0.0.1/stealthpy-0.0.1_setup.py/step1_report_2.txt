{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and dependencies, but also contains malicious behavior aimed at downloading and executing potentially harmful executables from remote servers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URLs to remote executables (requests.get), environment variables (hardcoded PATH), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "File writes ('open' to save executables), file renaming (Path().rename()), and execution of downloaded files via os.startfile.",
  "flows": "Requests retrieve malicious executables from URLs -> Save to local files -> Rename to system directory -> Execute files via os.startfile.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes downloading executables from external URLs, writing files to a system directory, renaming files to mimic system processes, executing downloaded files, and deleting the directory afterward. The package description and keywords also suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script combines standard setup procedures with malicious actions. It downloads two executable files from suspicious URLs, saves them in a directory that resembles a Windows system folder, renames them to appear as system processes, and executes them. The cleanup involves removing the directory after execution. These behaviors are characteristic of malware designed to infect or persist on a system. The use of 'requests' for external downloads and 'os.startfile' for execution, along with renaming files to system-like names, indicates malicious intent. The setup portion appears to be a decoy or an attempt to mask the malicious activities within a seemingly legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior aimed at downloading, executing, and hiding executables in the system directory. The setup metadata appears to be a cover story. This code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous, suitable for immediate review and removal from any repository.",
