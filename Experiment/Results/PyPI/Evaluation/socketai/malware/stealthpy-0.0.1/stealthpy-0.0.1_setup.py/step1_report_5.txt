{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then downloads and executes two remote executables, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The URLs from which the code downloads executables; the code reads environment variables and file system state.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile; file system modifications such as creating and deleting files and directories.",
  "flows": "Requests retrieve executable content from URLs -> files are saved locally -> files are renamed and executed -> directory is removed.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading executables from untrusted URLs, executing downloaded files without validation, creating and deleting files/directories in system root, use of potentially suspicious paths like 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK'.",
  "analysis": "The code initially appears to define a Python package setup, but the core malicious activity involves downloading two executable files from Discord CDN URLs, saving and renaming them in a system directory, and executing them. It then attempts to delete the directory. The approach resembles typical dropper behavior. The use of hardcoded URLs, execution of external binaries, and creation/removal of system directories are clear indicators of malicious intent. The setup code may be a distraction or part of a supply chain compromise, but the primary concern is the post-setup malicious download and execution flow.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and deleting remote executables without validation. These actions are typical of malware loaders or dropper components, posing high security risks.",
