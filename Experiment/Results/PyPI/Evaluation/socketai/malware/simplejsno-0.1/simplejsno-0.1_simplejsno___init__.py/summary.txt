  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code, with Reports 1 and 4 showing moderate to high suspicion justified by their indicators. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with slight adjustments for clarity. The overall assessment suggests a moderate security concern primarily driven by Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators."
