  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the consistency of their assessments and scores, and determine if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Potential indicators of malicious behavior, including network activity with unverified data, hardcoded URLs, suspicious network activity, use of eval()/exec(), or obfuscated code segments.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.2, securityRisk 0.5\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion about potential malicious indicators aligns with the malware and obfuscation scores. The risk score of 0.5 seems appropriate given the moderate suspicion.\n- The reasoning appears sound, given the lack of concrete code snippets but the mention of common red flags.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code appears benign, performing data processing or utility functions without signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The confidence score is high (0.9), indicating strong belief in benignity.\n- The securityRisk of 0.3 might be slightly high given the lack of suspicious features; perhaps 0.2 would be more consistent.\n- The reasoning is consistent, noting the absence of anomalies.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly reduce `securityRisk` to **0.2** for better consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code appears straightforward, with no malicious constructs, benign in nature.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The high confidence (0.9) and low scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code shows signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and potential malicious payloads. Suspicious indicators include obfuscation, eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.8, securityRisk 0.75\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The malware score of 0.6 is justified given the suspicious indicators.\n- Obfuscation score of 0.8 aligns with the description.\n- Security risk of 0.75 is appropriate due to high suspicion.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious features, straightforward code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The high confidence (0.9) and low scores are consistent.\n- The reasoning matches the scores.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n- **Report 2:** Slightly reduce `securityRisk` from 0.3 to **0.2** for consistency with the benign assessment.\n\n### Final malware, obfuscated, and risk score estimates:\n- **Malware:** Given the overall assessments, the highest suspicion is in Report 4 (0.6). Other reports are mostly benign. I would estimate an **average malware score around 0.2–0.3**, leaning toward **0.3** to reflect some moderate concern due to the suspicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated:** Most reports are clear, with only Report 4 indicating obfuscation at 0.8. Overall, I’d set an **average obfuscated score around 0.2–0.3**, perhaps **0.3** to account for some reports showing minimal obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Considering the reports, the highest risk is from Report 4 (0.75). Others are low. An overall estimate would be around **0.3–0.4**, leaning toward **0.4** to reflect the potential threat level.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | **0.3**         |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.3**         |\n| Security Risk  | **0.4**         |\n\nThis balanced estimate accounts for the varying degrees of suspicion and benignity across all reports.",
