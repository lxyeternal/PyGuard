  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation and performs system-level modifications, package management, and file manipulations indicative of malicious or backdoor activity. The high scores reflect the high probability of malicious intent, and it should be treated as malware. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment or execution."
