  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward setup configuration without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed package metadata such as name, version, license, authors, email, description, and package list. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
