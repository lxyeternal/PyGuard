  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static source data in setup() parameters: name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, specifying metadata such as name, version, license, authors, email, description, and package list. All data are hardcoded strings with no external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. There are no sources or sinks involving untrusted data or code injection. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
