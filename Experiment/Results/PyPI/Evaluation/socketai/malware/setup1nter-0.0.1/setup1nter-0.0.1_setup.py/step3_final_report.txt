  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters (name, version, license, authors, email, description, long_description, keywords, packages).",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or output involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static configuration imply a very low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, harmless setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
