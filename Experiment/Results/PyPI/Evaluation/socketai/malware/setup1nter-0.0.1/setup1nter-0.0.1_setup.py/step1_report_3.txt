  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools; data within setup() parameters (name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, packages).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; setup() parameters are static strings and lists, not influenced by external input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors; the code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata. All values are hardcoded strings and lists, with no user input, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. The code structure and content are typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no suspicious code flows, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
