  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'setup1nter' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – static setup configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with static package metadata such as name, version, license, authors, email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no use of environment variables or secrets. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
