  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs; straightforward static code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script utilizing setuptools with static metadata. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data sources, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no obfuscation or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
