  "purpose": "Configure and package the 'colorfonts' Python library for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sensitive data leaks are present; no sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup function executes static metadata assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls the 'setup' function with static parameters to prepare the package. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious code structures or obfuscation are present. The purpose appears solely to configure package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks.",
