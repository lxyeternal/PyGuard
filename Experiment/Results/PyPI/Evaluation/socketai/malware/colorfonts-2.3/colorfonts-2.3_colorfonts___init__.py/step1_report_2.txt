  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling points in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; the code only imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is standard practice for including external libraries. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent can be inferred from this single line. Since no further code is provided, there's no indication of any malicious activity, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign. However, without additional context or implementation details, this assessment is limited.",
