{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'installed' and executes it, serving as a basic indicator or log message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs a static message via print, with no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function executes directly without data manipulation or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward and clear code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a function that prints a message and calling it immediately. It involves no external data, no user input, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate it is benign. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
