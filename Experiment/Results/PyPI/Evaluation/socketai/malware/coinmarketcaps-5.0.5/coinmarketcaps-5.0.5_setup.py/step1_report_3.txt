{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package called 'coinmarketcaps' with custom post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP requests to external URLs. It also fetches and executes an executable file from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, execution of downloaded executable via os.system, and access to environment variables.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to an external URL. If on Windows, an external executable is downloaded and executed, potentially compromising the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally attempts to send system info to an external server and executes a remote executable without validation. The use of 'try-except' without handling exceptions is suspicious, indicating possible concealment of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that captures the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends it to a suspicious URL. If running on Windows, it downloads a file from a potentially malicious URL and executes it, which could be used to install malware or perform malicious actions. The custom installation class triggers this function after the package is installed. No safeguards or validation are in place, and the URLs used are obscure and potentially malicious. This behavior resembles typical malicious supply chain activity, aiming to exfiltrate system information and download malware during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info and downloading/executing external code without user consent. The pattern suggests an attempt to compromise the host system via the package's post-install script.",
