{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes post-install actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME'), makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and executes a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded file via os.system, network requests to external URLs, potentially for command and control or payload delivery.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to external server with 'COMPUTERNAME' -> download of executable -> execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts external URLs, sends system info, and executes a downloaded executable without user consent, which is suspicious. Usage of 'os.system' to run a potentially malicious executable is highly concerning. The 'send()' function communicates with external domains and downloads and runs a file, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and requests. The 'send()' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external server, then downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. This behavior is typical of malicious code attempting to deliver and run malware post-install. The try-except block suppresses errors, reducing visibility of failures. The setup configuration uses a custom post-install class that runs 'send()' after installation, enabling the malicious behavior upon package install. Overall, the code exhibits malicious activity aimed at remote code execution and potential data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates clear malicious intent, including remote data exfiltration, downloading, and executing a payload without user consent. The use of external URLs, environment data collection, and silent execution of downloaded files mark it as malicious. It should not be used.",
