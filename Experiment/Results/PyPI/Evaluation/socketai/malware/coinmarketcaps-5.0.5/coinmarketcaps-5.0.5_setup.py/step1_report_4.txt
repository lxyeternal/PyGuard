{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package and execute a post-installation step that retrieves and runs an external executable, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URL request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'; URL request to 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'; download and execution of 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe'.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an external file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') via os.system, which can run malicious code on the host system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' -> download of 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' -> execution of the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling with 'try-except: pass', suppressing errors; dynamic download and execution of external executable during package installation; retrieval of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL, potentially leaking system information. During installation, it downloads an executable from an external source and executes it, which is highly suspicious and typical of malware behavior. The use of 'try-except' without handling errors masks potential issues. The code is embedded in the post-installation process of a package, making it a supply chain security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing a remote file, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
