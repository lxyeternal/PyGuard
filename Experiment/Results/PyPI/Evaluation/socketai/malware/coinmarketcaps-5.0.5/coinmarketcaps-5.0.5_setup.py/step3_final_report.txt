{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system info, downloads, and executes a payload during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to external server; downloading and executing an executable file.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable) -> HTTP request -> download executable -> execute executable.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling; remote code execution during setup; suspicious URLs; hardcoded filenames.",
  "analysis": "The code contacts external servers, exfiltrates system info, downloads a potentially malicious executable, and runs it silently during package installation. Exception handling suppresses errors, hiding failures. The URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded files without user consent is a high-risk activity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and exhibits behaviors typical of malware. The malicious activities are confirmed, and the code's intent appears harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing data exfiltration and remote payload execution during setup. It should be classified with maximum malware and security risk scores.",
