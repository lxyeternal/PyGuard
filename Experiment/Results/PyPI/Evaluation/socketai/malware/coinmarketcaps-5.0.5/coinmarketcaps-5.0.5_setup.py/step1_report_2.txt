{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'coinmarketcaps' with custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs used in requests, executable files downloaded and executed.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, execution of downloaded files via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' → HTTP GET request to external server → download and execution of potentially malicious executable.",
  "anomalies": "Function 'send' contacts an external server with system info, downloads and executes an executable without user consent, uses broad exception handling to suppress errors, and no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a 'send' function that attempts to retrieve the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and send it to an external URL. It then downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it directly, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The exception handling is broad, hiding any errors that occur, which could obscure malicious activity. The setup process triggers this 'send' function during installation, potentially installing malware silently. Usage of requests to contact external sites and execute arbitrary files is highly suspicious and typical of supply chain malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by contacting external servers, exfiltrating system info, downloading, and executing arbitrary executables without user consent. It likely constitutes a supply chain attack vector or malicious backdoor.",
