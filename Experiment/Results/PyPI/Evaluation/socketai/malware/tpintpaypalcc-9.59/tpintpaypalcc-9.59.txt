      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package setup. The use of stealth techniques and suspicious URL comments strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for further review or removal."
