  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script defining package metadata and dependencies for 'discordcmd'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function and its parameters, including 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script is static configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Includes 'loads' and 'urlopen' in 'install_requires', which are not valid package names; likely typos or placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with correct syntax. The main concern is the invalid dependencies: 'loads' (possibly intended as 'json') and 'urlopen' (a function from 'urllib.request'). These will cause installation errors but do not indicate malicious behavior. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The dependency issues are configuration errors rather than security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with misconfigured dependencies. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary issue is the invalid dependency names, which should be corrected to ensure proper installation. Overall, the security risk is minimal, primarily operational.",
