  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high suspicion of malicious activity primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window triggered conditionally. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload warrants further decoding and analysis. The overall security risk is high, and caution should be exercised."
