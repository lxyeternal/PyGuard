  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints a message indicating an installation status and then calls that function.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a print statement to standard output.",
  "flows": "N/A — no external data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a static message 'installed' when invoked. The function is called immediately after its definition. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or any other potentially malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a simple print operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
