  "purpose": "A trivial Python script defining and calling a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables; static code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; function call executes a simple print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and lacks suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints a static message and then calls it. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, no network activity, and no complex logic. The code is simple, clear, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious features. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign script with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
