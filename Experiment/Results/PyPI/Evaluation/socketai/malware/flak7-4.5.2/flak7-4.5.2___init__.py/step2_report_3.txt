  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is extremely simple, with no external data sources, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. The code only defines a function that prints a static message and then calls it. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Security Risks:**  \n   Given the code's benign nature, the security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**  \n   The reports uniformly rate the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports are thorough and do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Any discrepancies or points of contention:**  \n   No discrepancies are apparent. The code is trivial, and the analysis is consistent.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks associated with this code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign script with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThere is no need to adjust the scores; they correctly reflect the code's harmless nature.",
