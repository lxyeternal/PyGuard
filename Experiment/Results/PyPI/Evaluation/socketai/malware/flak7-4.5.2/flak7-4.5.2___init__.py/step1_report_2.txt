  "purpose": "Simple function that prints 'installed' and is called immediately after definition.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code merely executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Code is extremely minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that outputs a static string 'installed' when called. It does not accept input, read files, connect to networks, or perform any data processing. The function is invoked immediately, which is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors. The simplicity and lack of external dependencies or data handling suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward script that outputs a message. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
