  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling is involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function call simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'ina' that prints a fixed string 'installed' when called. It then immediately calls this function. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple print operation, and contains no malicious or security risk indicators.",
