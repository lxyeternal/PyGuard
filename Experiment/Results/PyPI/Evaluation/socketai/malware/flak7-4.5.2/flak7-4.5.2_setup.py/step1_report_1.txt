{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'flak7' Python package with an embedded post-installation process.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL in requests.get, and file download via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute downloaded file, network requests to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sending data to external server via HTTP GET -> downloading executable -> executing the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except block with broad exception handling; downloads and executes an external executable during installation; no validation or sandboxing; potential misuse of environment variable data.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends it to an external URL. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately during the install process, which is a significant security concern. The broad exception handling masks errors, and the code automates execution of potentially malicious content during package installation. This behavior aligns with malicious supply chain activity, such as remote payload execution and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during installation, which could harm the user's system and compromise security. The use of environment data transmission further indicates potential data leakage or tracking.",
