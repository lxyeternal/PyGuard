  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script with custom post-install behavior including sending environment data and downloading/executing an executable.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', remote URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and the content of the downloaded executable.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the downloaded file, network requests sending data to external domain.",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends it via HTTP GET request -> Downloads an executable from a suspicious URL -> Executes the downloaded file using os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to suppress errors, sending environment info to a suspicious URL, downloading and executing an executable from an untrusted source, potential for malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', then sends this information via a GET request to a suspicious domain. It also downloads an executable from an external URL and executes it silently. The use of try-except without logging or alerting hides potential malicious activity. The downloaded executable is likely malicious, given the context of suspicious URLs and behavior. The setup configuration includes a custom install command that triggers this behavior during package installation. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious intent or malicious payload delivery during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment information and executing a remote binary, which poses a security risk. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
