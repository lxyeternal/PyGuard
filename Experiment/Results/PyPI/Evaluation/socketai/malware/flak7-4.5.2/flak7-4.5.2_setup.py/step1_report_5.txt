{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'flak7' with custom post-install behavior that attempts to send environment data and download an executable file.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and network requests to 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com'.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, saving and executing a downloaded file, and potentially executing it via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET request -> Downloads an executable -> Executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional exception suppression, dynamic network activity during installation, download and execution of external files, use of suspicious URLs, and environment data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests modules, defining a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it using 'os.system', all within an exception block that suppresses errors. The custom install class executes this 'send' function after installation. This behavior is atypical for normal package setup, indicating potential malicious intent aimed at system compromise, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting environment info, downloading, and executing external payloads during installation. The URLs and execution pattern strongly suggest an intent to compromise or control the user's system, constituting a high security risk.",
