{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information and download and execute a remote payload during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external server; downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious domain.",
  "flows": "Source ('COMPUTERNAME') -> HTTP request to exfiltrate data -> download of executable -> execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masking errors; downloading and executing an unverified external executable during setup; use of suspicious URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment data, exfiltrates it via an HTTP request, then downloads and executes a remote executable during installation. The broad exception handling masks potential errors, and the URLs used are suspicious. The actions are characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, with remote code execution and data exfiltration confirmed. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but performs high-risk operations during setup, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits confirmed malicious activity, including remote payload execution and data exfiltration. The malware score should be set to 1, security risk to 1, obfuscation to 0, and overall confidence high. The package is unsafe and should be flagged or removed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
