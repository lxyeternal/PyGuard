{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed for stealing sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, Discord, and other applications. It also gathers system information, exfiltrates data via webhooks, and uploads files to file-sharing services, indicating an intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser data directories, Discord local storage, login data, cookies, Telegram data, and user documents on Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders.",
  "sinks": "The script exfiltrates collected data by sending HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and upload services such as Gofile.io and AnonFiles. It writes collected information to temporary files, then uploads them via network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various sources (browser storage, login databases, cookies, Telegram tdata, user folders) through parsing and decryption functions, then proceeds to upload or send data over network endpoints. Token extraction, password decryption, cookie extraction, and file uploads represent key source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, attempts to install dependencies silently, obfuscation in some regex patterns, use of system commands to terminate processes, and multiple functions that gather and exfiltrate sensitive data without user consent. The presence of functions for password and token extraction, file zipping, and uploads without user interaction are suspicious. Also, the code contains commented-out sections and redundant imports, indicating possible obfuscation or unfinished/hidden features.",
  "analysis": "The script automates the collection of sensitive data from browsers, Discord, Telegram, and local files, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, and gathers user info and tokens. It uses threading for concurrent operations, including zipping files and uploading data. Hardcoded webhooks and file-sharing URLs point to exfiltration points. The code features functions to decrypt data protected by Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI), and utilizes request libraries to send data. The presence of functions that kill processes, gather wallet and application files, and upload them further supports malicious intent. The script operates stealthily by suppressing exceptions, installing dependencies silently, and handling multiple data sources without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, aiming to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from various sources on the system. It exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads to external servers. The script's structure, hardcoded webhook, and data collection methods indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent and active data theft. It should not be executed or used in any context where security is a concern.",
