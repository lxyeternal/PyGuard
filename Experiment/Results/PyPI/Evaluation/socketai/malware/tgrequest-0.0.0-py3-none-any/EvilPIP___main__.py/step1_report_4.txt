{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other user data from browsers, applications, and local files, then uploading or exfiltrating this data to remote servers, primarily Discord webhooks and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Sources include local browser storage files, Discord data files, login databases (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies'), zip archives, and various directories related to browsers, applications, and downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include network requests to webhooks and file upload endpoints (e.g., Gofile), file writing operations (saving logs and extracted data), and subprocess commands that may terminate processes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (local files, browser data, application files) through parsing, decryption, and regex extraction, then to network sinks (upload functions) and file outputs, with multiple threads handling parallel data collection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated function names, extensive use of thread spawning for simultaneous operations, attempts to install dependencies silently, and collection of a wide range of user data including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. Also, it terminates processes like browsers or apps, which may be suspicious. There are comments indicating malicious intent (e.g., 'W4SP STEALER').",
  "analysis": "The script performs comprehensive data theft by extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from multiple browsers and applications. It decrypts sensitive data using Windows API calls, interacts with Discord API to gather user info, and uploads stolen data to external servers. It employs threading for concurrency and obfuscates some functions. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent dependency installation, and process termination commands are typical behaviors of malware designed for data exfiltration. The code does not seem to include obfuscation beyond variable names, but the malicious behaviors are explicit and persistent throughout. All operations are aimed at covertly collecting and transmitting user data without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a data-stealing malware (spyware). It targets user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and other personal data, then exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file upload services. Its use of threading, silent installs, process termination, and comprehensive data collection confirms its intent for malicious purposes. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
