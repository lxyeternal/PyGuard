  "purpose": "This script is designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate the data via webhooks and upload services, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading browser data files (e.g., Login Data, Cookies, Local State), user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), and process memory (via tokens, passwords, cookies). Also reading network activity and local files matching specific keywords.",
  "sinks": "Uploading extracted data to Discord webhook, Gofile.io upload links, and other online endpoints; copying and zipping user files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser files, user directories, memory analysis) → Data extraction functions (getPassw, getCookie, getToken, GatherZips, KiwiFile) → Data formatting and aggregation → Data exfiltration via webhook or upload functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, repeated thread spawning without validation, downloading and installing Python modules silently, copying browser databases and decrypting master keys, and extensive data collection aimed at stealing user credentials and files. Presence of comments and code structure indicating intentional data theft. Usage of potentially suspicious external URLs and obfuscation patterns in regex.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, suggesting data exfiltration. It installs necessary libraries without user consent. It accesses browser directories and local application data to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information, decrypting data where needed using Windows API functions. It processes files like browser login databases, decrypts stored credentials, and collects Discord-related tokens, user info, billing info, and badges. It then formats this data and sends it to a Discord webhook. Additionally, it gathers files from user directories based on keywords, compresses and uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and reports links. The code uses threading to handle multiple data sources concurrently. The presence of functions to collect cookies, passwords, tokens, files, and the use of the `requests` library for data exfiltration strongly indicates malicious intent. The code structure and comments suggest this is designed for stealth and large-scale data theft across multiple applications and browsers.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, designed to steal user tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrate them via online services and webhooks. Its purpose is consistent with malware such as info stealers or spyware. The code's structure, hardcoded webhook, and data collection patterns confirm malicious intent with high confidence.",
