{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer, designed to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information from browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include browser profile directories, log files (.log, .ldb), and application data files such as 'Local State', 'Login Data', and extension directories. It also reads environment variables, system files, and process information.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external URLs via HTTP POST requests, notably to a Discord webhook and file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io, anonfiles). It also writes data into temporary files for further exfiltration. File uploads and HTTP requests are the primary sinks.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from local browser and application data files, decrypted and parsed, into structured sensitive information (tokens, passwords, cookies). This data is then sent over the network through HTTP POST requests to webhooks or file upload services.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs obfuscated function names, dynamic package installation, and multiple threading operations that could mask malicious activity. It forcibly kills processes like browsers and wallets before zipping files, suggesting an attempt to terminate security or related processes. Hardcoded webhook URL and repetitive data exfiltration routines are suspicious. The code also captures and decrypts stored passwords and cookies, which is typical of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to harvest sensitive data from user browsers, applications, and extensions, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API and Chromium-based decryption methods. It then exfiltrates the collected data via webhooks and file uploads. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process termination commands, and extensive credential harvesting strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code also uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks simultaneously, likely to evade detection or speed up exfiltration. The code’s obfuscation (e.g., unclear function names, dynamic package installs) further suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a credential, token, password, and file stealer targeting browsers and popular applications. It exfiltrates sensitive data to external servers, terminates security-related processes, and employs obfuscation techniques to evade detection. It poses a high security risk and should be blocked and analyzed further for potential system compromise.",
