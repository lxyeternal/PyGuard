{
  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function to test module operation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output channels are present beyond a print statement.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist as the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that outputs a static greeting message. It imports no external modules, reads no data, and performs no sensitive operations. The overall structure is simple and appears purely illustrative, consistent with the documented purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is non-malicious, serves a demonstration purpose, and contains no security risks. It is a benign sample of a function printing a message.",
