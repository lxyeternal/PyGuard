{
  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function that prints a static message to test the module.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; the code does not read any data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only outputs a static message via print.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the function executes independently without data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'hello()' that prints a fixed message. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no external data handling, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and corroborating reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified, reflecting a safe, demonstration-level function.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
