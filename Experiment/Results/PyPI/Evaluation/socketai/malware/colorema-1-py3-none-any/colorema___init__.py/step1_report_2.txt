  "purpose": "The code defines a simple test function to demonstrate module operation.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "The only output is a print statement which outputs a static message.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a standard function with a straightforward print statement; no suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single function that prints a static message. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no external dependencies or malicious patterns. The comments reference an external URL but do not execute or fetch any code from it. The code appears to serve as a benign demonstration or testing stub.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks in this snippet. The code is benign and straightforward.",
