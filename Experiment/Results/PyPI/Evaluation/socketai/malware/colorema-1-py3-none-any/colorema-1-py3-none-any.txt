      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for credential theft, system sabotage, and data exfiltration. It employs some obfuscation but is not heavily encrypted. The overall security risk is maximum, and the malware classification is justified. The code's behaviors pose a severe threat to system security and user privacy."
