{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and Roblox credentials, then send the collected data to a specified webhook, with additional capabilities like injecting code into Discord and bypassing security protections.",
  "sources": "Reads local storage files (leveldb, sqlite), environment variables, registry entries, and local system files (e.g., Chrome's login data, cookies).",
  "sinks": "Sends data to remote webhook URL via HTTP POST, writes to local files, and attempts to run injected code/executables; kills processes and manipulates files.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources (storage files, environment variables, registry) is decrypted or parsed and then sent over network via webhook. It also injects JavaScript into Discord's files and terminates Discord processes. Collected data includes tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info, then packaged into a zip file and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated or misleading variable names, attempts to hide self (hiding file attributes, copying itself to startup), manipulates Discord's internal files and process list, modifies Discord's files for code injection, disables security tools, and exfiltrates system info and user data. Presence of hardcoded webhook and injection URL indicates malicious intent. Deletion of temp files after use suggests attempts to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code loads sensitive data from various local storage locations and decrypts stored credentials and tokens. It employs threading and asynchronous functions to maximize data collection efficiency. The code performs self-concealment by hiding its executable and copying itself to startup. It injects JavaScript into Discord's application files, potentially for persistence or further malicious activity. It kills Discord processes and disables security measures like token protectors. The script gathers system info, IP geolocation, and user data, then zips all collected files and uploads them to a remote webhook, along with detailed system information. The overall behavior aligns with typical credential-stealing malware with persistence and exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious; it is designed for data theft, process injection, system manipulation, and exfiltration of sensitive user information. It exhibits behaviors typical of malware including credential extraction, process termination, self-hiding, code injection, and remote data exfiltration. Its primary intent appears to be unauthorized data collection and system compromise.",
