{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to extract sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, Roblox cookies, system information, and other potentially private data, then exfiltrate it via a webhook. It also injects code into Discord installations and can manipulate system startup and process behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local environment variables, user directories (for browser and app data), file reads (leveldb, sqlite, and logs), system commands (PowerShell), and network requests to fetch injection scripts and send data.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests to a specified Discord webhook, including files and constructed embed messages containing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and user details are collected from sources like local app data, browser databases, and system registry, then processed/decrypted and sent to the webhook. The script also injects code into Discord-related directories, kills processes, and manipulates system startup behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, malicious functions like token and password harvesting, disabling security measures, injecting scripts into Discord installations, deleting files, modifying system startup, and killing processes associated with Discord. It also manipulates system files and collects extensive user and system data without consent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious actions: it harvests Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, Roblox credentials, and system info; it injects code into Discord to potentially execute malicious scripts; kills Discord and related processes; modifies system startup entries; hides itself; and exfiltrates all collected data via a webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, system manipulations, and extensive data theft functionalities indicates malicious intent. It also attempts to disable protections (e.g., bypass token protector, modify BetterDiscord data), which are common in malware aimed at persistence and data theft. The code uses obfuscation techniques in some parts (e.g., replacing spaces with unicode characters in strings), and constructs detailed reports with system info, geolocation, and user data. The overall behavior is consistent with a credential stealer and information exfiltration malware, targeting user privacy and system security.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits highly malicious behavior: it is designed as a credential and data stealer with capabilities to inject code, manipulate processes, disable security features, and exfiltrate extensive personal and system data. Its purpose clearly aligns with malware activities, and it should not be used or executed. The code demonstrates clear malicious intent with multiple functionalities aimed at unauthorized data collection and system manipulation.",
