{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract and steal user tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this information via a Discord webhook. It also manipulates Discord and browser files for injection and sabotage purposes.",
  "sources": "File reads (browser databases, config files, logs, local state files), environment variables, subprocess commands, network requests, process iteration, and user input (via reading files and environment).",
  "sinks": "Network POST requests to webhook (exfiltration of tokens, data, system info), file writes (storing stolen info), process control (killing processes, modifying files), and executable launches (injecting code, killing processes).",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser and application files (sources), decrypted or parsed, then either sent via HTTP POST to a webhook or stored locally before exfiltration (sinks). The malware primarily collects tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, then uploads or stores them.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques such as replacing spaces with unicode characters in strings, using exception suppression broadly, injecting code into Discord processes, and extensive use of try-except blocks with minimal error handling. The code also attempts to manipulate Discord and browser files, which is suspicious. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and injection URL indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious token and data grabber targeting browsers, Discord, and Roblox. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts tokens from various browser and application directories, and steals user info. It injects JavaScript into Discord processes, kills Discord processes, modifies Discord files, and sabotages Discord security tools. It also exfiltrates collected data and system info to a Discord webhook, including a ZIP archive of all stolen files. Obfuscation techniques and broad exception handling reduce traceability. The presence of functions for injecting scripts, killing processes, and stealing credentials strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed for stealing user credentials, tokens, cookies, system info, and injecting code into Discord. It exfiltrates data via webhook, sabotages Discord security, and covers its tracks with obfuscation. The overall risk is extremely high, and the package should not be used.",
