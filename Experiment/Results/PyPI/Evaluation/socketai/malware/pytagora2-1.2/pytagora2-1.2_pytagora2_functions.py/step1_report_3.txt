{
  "purpose": "Calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a secondary calculation for 'other' using Pythagoras theorem.",
  "sources": "The 'hello()' function which executes dynamically decoded code via base64 and exec; potential external data in base64 string.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call that executes dynamically decoded code; the base64 decoding operation itself is a potential sink if the encoded payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and executed in 'hello()'. The code then proceeds to perform mathematical calculations based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded code from a base64 string; no other external input handling or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a 'hello()' function that decodes and executes an obfuscated base64 string, which is a potential security concern due to the use of exec() with decoded content. The 'hypotenuse' and 'other' functions perform mathematical calculations using 'math' functions without external input validation. The presence of exec() with decoded code is suspicious and indicates possible malicious behavior or backdoor, depending on payload content. No other suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or network calls are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious component due to the use of exec() with dynamically decoded code, which could execute arbitrary or malicious payloads. The rest of the code performs benign mathematical calculations, but the initial obfuscated code execution warrants caution.",
