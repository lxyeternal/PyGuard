{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for mathematical calculations, specifically computing the hypotenuse and another related value, with an embedded obfuscated execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters passed to functions, and internally executes base64-decoded code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes dynamically decoded code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the base64 string is malicious.",
  "flows": "Potential flow involves decoding the base64 string in hello(), then executing it via exec(). The mathematical functions call hello(), which triggers the execution of external code, potentially affecting the system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed with exec() is suspicious. The code within exec() is obfuscated and not directly readable, indicating possible concealment of malicious intent. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs before use in mathematical functions, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries (math, base64, sys). The function hello() decodes a base64 string and executes it with exec(). The base64 string likely contains malicious or obfuscated code, given its encoding and execution. The mathematical functions (hypotenuse and other) call hello(), meaning every invocation of these functions triggers the execution of the decoded code. This setup is suspicious, as it suggests embedded malicious code that could be run inadvertently or deliberately. The structure indicates potential for remote code execution or malicious behavior, especially since the decoded code is hidden.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious exec() call with obfuscated, base64-encoded code, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. This hidden code could perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or remote command execution. The functions themselves are benign-looking but are used as triggers for executing the embedded malicious code.",
