{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide functions to calculate the hypotenuse and another related measurement, with an embedded obfuscated payload executed at runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (a, b, c, x), and executes a base64-decoded payload via exec.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (a, b, c, x) are used in mathematical calculations. The payload decoded by exec() is executed directly, allowing potential malicious code to run. There is a source-to-sink flow from the base64 payload to exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a base64-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime is suspicious, especially given the obfuscated nature of the payload. The code uses exec() to run dynamic code, which is a high-risk behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports math and base64 modules, then defines a function hello() that decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically via exec(). The payload, when decoded, appears to be complex, likely containing further malicious instructions or backdoors. The functions hypotenuse() and other() perform mathematical calculations and call hello(), which triggers the execution of the obfuscated payload. The code's structure suggests intentional concealment of malicious code, and the use of exec() with decoded data is a common technique for evading static analysis. The parameters used in calculations do not influence the payload execution, indicating the main concern is the embedded obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious base64-encoded payload executed via exec(), which poses a significant security risk. The presence of obfuscated code and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent or backdoor functionality. Therefore, this package should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious, and its use should be avoided.",
