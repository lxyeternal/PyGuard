{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for calculating the hypotenuse and other geometric computations, with an embedded obfuscated payload executed during the hello() function call.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the base64-encoded string in the exec() call, which is decoded and executed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded payload, which can perform arbitrary actions, including malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The payload decoded from base64 is executed immediately upon calling hello(), allowing it to perform any operations with the permissions of the script.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed via exec(), which is a common obfuscation technique. The payload appears encoded to hide its true intent. The use of exec() on decoded data is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports math, base64, sys modules. It defines hello() which executes a base64-decoded string via exec(). This payload likely contains malicious code, as the base64 string is a common method to obfuscate malicious payloads. The functions hypotenuse() and other() perform straightforward mathematical calculations and call hello() within hypotenuse(), leading to the execution of the potentially malicious payload whenever hypotenuse() is invoked. The code structure suggests the payload is intentionally concealed and executed at runtime, raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload embedded in a base64 string executed via exec(). The presence of obfuscation and immediate execution upon function call indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The functions for mathematical computations are likely decoys or part of an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Overall, the code is highly suspicious with potential malware embedded.",
