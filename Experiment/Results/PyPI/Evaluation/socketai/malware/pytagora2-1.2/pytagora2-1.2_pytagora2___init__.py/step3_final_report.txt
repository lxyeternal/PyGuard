{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'functions', likely to utilize its functionalities in the larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import functions' indicates the source of external code, but no data input or external data sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this minimal code snippet; there are no data outputs, network connections, or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows, source-to-sink paths, or data manipulations in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a single import statement with no additional logic, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, containing only an import statement. No data sources, sinks, or flows are evident. The module name 'functions' is generic and common. Given the lack of further code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is effectively 0. Confidence in benignity is high (close to 1), as the snippet is straightforward and standard. No suspicious patterns or indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statement alone does not pose any risk, and the scores should reflect this benign assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
