{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'functions'. The purpose of this code appears to be to include external functionality, but without additional context, the specific purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement, which loads the 'functions' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet as no further code is provided.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet due to absence of executable logic beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains an import statement with no further logic, which is normal and does not exhibit any unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single import statement: 'import functions'. This is a standard way to include a module in Python. Without additional code, there are no apparent sources, sinks, or flows of data. The module name 'functions' is generic and does not inherently suggest malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior can be detected from this minimal snippet. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is likely to use functions from an external module, and no malicious actions are evident.",
