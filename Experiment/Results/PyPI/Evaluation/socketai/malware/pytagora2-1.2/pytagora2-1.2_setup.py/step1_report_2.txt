{
  "purpose": "The code is for configuring the setup of a Python package named 'pytagora2'.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the setup() function parameters such as 'name', 'packages', 'version', 'license', 'description', 'author', 'author_email', 'url', 'download_url', 'keywords', 'install_requires', and 'classifiers'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be the 'author_email', 'url', and 'download_url', which may be used to fetch or send data if misused, but here they are static. No insecure code or data leaks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; all inputs are statically defined parameters within the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated content. The code uses standard setup() configuration with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core.setup' and calls setup() with static parameters to configure a package. No dynamic input, user input, or external data manipulation is present. All fields are typical for a package setup. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is found. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It contains no obfuscated or suspicious code, and all data appears static and benign.",
