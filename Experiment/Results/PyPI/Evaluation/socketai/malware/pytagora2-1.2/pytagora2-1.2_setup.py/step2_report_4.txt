  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using distutils.\n- All inputs are static, hardcoded parameters.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- URLs and email are benign and typical for package metadata.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define and configure a Python package setup script.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Configure setup for 'pytagora2'.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Setup configuration.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Setup for distribution.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; URLs and email are metadata, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Note:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to URLs, but these are standard metadata fields. Unless URLs are known malicious, this is a very minor concern.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; the score aligns with the benign nature but notes potential risk in metadata.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 due to URLs—reasonable given the context.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no significant security risk; minor metadata concerns are benign)\n\n---\n\n## **Final notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.\n- The slight security risk score in one report is justified by metadata, but not indicative of actual vulnerability.\n\n**In conclusion, I confirm that the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or meaningful security risks.**",
