  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pytagora2'.",
  "sources": "Constants and function calls within the setup() function, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted or external data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded package information into the setup() function, with no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of distutils is standard; no obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, using distutils. It contains only package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The code appears benign and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a straightforward, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
