  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python library named 'pytagora2' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, author, email, url, download_url, keywords, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assigned to setup parameters; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using distutils, with static, hardcoded metadata. No dynamic input, code execution, or obfuscation is present. URLs and email are standard package metadata, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the presence of URLs and email but does not indicate actual malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the static, standard nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
