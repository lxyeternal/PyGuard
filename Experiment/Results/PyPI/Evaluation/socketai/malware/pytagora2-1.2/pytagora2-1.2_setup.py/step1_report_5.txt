  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'pytagora2'.",
  "sources": "Imports from distutils.core, setup() function call with metadata and configuration details.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities; the code mainly defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. No dynamic execution or external code fetching observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for Python packaging, utilizing 'distutils.core.setup'. It specifies package metadata including name, version, author, URL, license, and dependencies. All data is static, hardcoded, and relevant to package setup. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The script does not perform any network operations, data collection, or dynamic code execution. It adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
