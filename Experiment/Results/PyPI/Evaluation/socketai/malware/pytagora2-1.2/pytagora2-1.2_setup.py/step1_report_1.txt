  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup script for publishing to PyPI",
  "sources": "The script reads input data from hardcoded strings within the setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system command executions are present",
  "flows": "Input data (metadata, URLs, email) flows into package configuration but does not lead to insecure operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing distutils. It includes package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and license. There are no dynamic or runtime inputs, no code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The URLs and email are hardcoded but benign, pointing to GitHub and a typical email address. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The script lacks any potentially dangerous operations or obfuscated logic. The license and package metadata appear legitimate and typical for open-source Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
