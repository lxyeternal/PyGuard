  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'pytagora2' for distribution via setup tools.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the package metadata fields such as author_email, url, download_url, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of URLs for download and repository, which could be exploited if malicious links are provided.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-defined metadata fields into the setup configuration, which could be exploited if URLs or email addresses are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code uses standard distutils setup functions. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing standard distutils. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling are present. URLs and email are standard metadata fields; they do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The URLs and email addresses are part of package metadata and do not pose an immediate threat.",
