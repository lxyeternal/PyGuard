{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__ module for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling, importing various classes and functions for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects; only imports and variable definitions",
  "flows": "The code imports various classes and functions to be used elsewhere; no data flows or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file (__init__) that imports components from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The imported modules may contain potentially sensitive or network-related code, but in this context, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or risky operations. The structure is typical for Python packages and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely imports and exposes internal components for external use.",
