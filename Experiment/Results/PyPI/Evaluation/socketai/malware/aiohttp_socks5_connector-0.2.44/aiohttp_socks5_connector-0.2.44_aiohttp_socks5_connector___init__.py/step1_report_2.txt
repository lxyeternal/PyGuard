{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, defining imports and exports for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the version string __version__.",
  "sinks": "Exports (via __all__) for classes, functions, and error types; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code mainly imports and exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports components related to proxy handling and defines public API exports. It does not perform any data input, processing, or output. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or dynamic code execution. The __version__ string is standard. All imported modules and classes are typical for a proxy library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign module for a proxy connection library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
