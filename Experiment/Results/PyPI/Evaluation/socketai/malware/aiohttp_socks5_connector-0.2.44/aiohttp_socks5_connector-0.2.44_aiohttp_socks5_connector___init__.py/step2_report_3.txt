  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python module initialization (__init__.py), importing classes, functions, and error types from local modules.\n- No report identifies any network activity, data processing, user input handling, or external data sinks.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not perform any runtime logic, dynamic code execution, or contain embedded secrets.\n- The only potential concern could be if the imported modules or classes themselves are malicious, but based solely on this fragment, that cannot be determined.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a typical module initializer with no malicious or security-related issues present.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any logic that could be exploited.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code snippet.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely import/export boilerplate with no runtime logic, network activity, or data handling, the risk scores of 0 are justified.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified, as there are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk in this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, benign Python module initializer for a proxy connection library. All scores should remain at 0, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
