{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client library, providing classes, errors, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), reading modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; purely import/export of modules and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes, exceptions, and functions from local modules and defines module metadata (__version__, __all__). It functions as a module interface or API entry point. No input handling, no network or system commands, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module interface file, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks identified. It serves as part of a larger proxy library without containing malicious or security-compromising code.",
