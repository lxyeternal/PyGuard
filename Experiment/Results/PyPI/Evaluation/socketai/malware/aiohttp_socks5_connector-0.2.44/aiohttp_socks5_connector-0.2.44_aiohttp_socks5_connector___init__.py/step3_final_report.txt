{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a proxy connection library, importing classes, functions, and error types from local modules and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input handling; no data leaks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports only; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py module setup, organizing imports and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or data processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, with no security vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initializer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's content.",
