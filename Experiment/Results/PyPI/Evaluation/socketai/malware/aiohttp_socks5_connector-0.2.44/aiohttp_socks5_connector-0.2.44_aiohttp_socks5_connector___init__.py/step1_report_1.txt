{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a Python package module related to proxy connections, importing various classes and functions for proxy handling, error management, and connection creation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly performs imports and module exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes and functions from other parts of the package, sets versioning, and defines __all__ for exports. There are no network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling. The structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files, focusing on organizing exports. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely manages imports and exports for a proxy-related package component.",
