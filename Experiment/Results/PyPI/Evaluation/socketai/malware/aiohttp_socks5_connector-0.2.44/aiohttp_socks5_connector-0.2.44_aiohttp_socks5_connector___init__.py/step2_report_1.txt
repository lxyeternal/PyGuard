  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module __init__.py pattern, importing classes, functions, and error types from local modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure.\n- There are no network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling within this snippet.\n- The version string is standard.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors are evident.\n- The code is consistent with typical package setup files, serving as an interface layer.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- **Purpose:** All describe the code as a module initializer for a proxy connection library, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Only import/export statements, no data flow or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code appears standard, well-structured, and benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that this is a benign, standard package setup file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Since no malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious activity is detected, the malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and follows standard patterns; obfuscation is **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security issues, risks should be **0**.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is only a module initializer with no hidden behaviors. Given the content, this is accurate.\n- If the local modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, etc.) contain malicious code, that cannot be assessed here. But based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No malicious behavior or payload detected in the provided code.            |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**             | Code is clear, standard, and unminified.                                    |\n| Risk            | **0**             | No security risks or vulnerabilities evident in this module initialization code. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard Python package __init__.py file, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf future analysis includes the actual implementations within the imported modules, a more comprehensive security review could be warranted. But based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
