{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define module exports and import statements for a Python package related to proxy connections, likely providing functionality for handling SOCKS proxy connections and errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points are present. No untrusted input processing, network calls, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code mainly establishes imports and module exports without any runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python module structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, assigns a version string, and defines the module's __all__ exports. It serves as a module initialization and interface definition. No user input, external data sources, or network interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or external calls indicate a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy-related package. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
