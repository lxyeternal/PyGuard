{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol and proxy errors to handle various error conditions in network communication.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; purely defining classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code consists solely of exception class definitions with no executable logic or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to SOCKS protocol errors and proxy issues. Each class inherits from a standard exception or a related custom exception. There are no data inputs, outputs, or network operations. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger error handling framework. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are evident. The simplicity and clarity suggest this is standard exception handling code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in network proxy/SOCKS communications. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and purely structural.",
