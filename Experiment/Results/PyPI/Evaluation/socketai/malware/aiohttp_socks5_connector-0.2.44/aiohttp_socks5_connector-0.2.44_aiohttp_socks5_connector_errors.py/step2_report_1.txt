  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign error handling class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Presence:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware: 0 in all reports  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports  \n  - Security Risk: 0 in all reports\n\n- **Are these scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since the code only defines exception classes, the risk is negligible.  \n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent or hidden behavior.  \n- Given the code's simplicity, this assumption is justified.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk associated with simple class definitions)\n\n**However, considering the context:**\n- These are exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors.  \n- They are standard and benign, but in supply chain security, even such code should be trusted, as malicious code can sometimes be hidden in seemingly innocuous files.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.  \n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
