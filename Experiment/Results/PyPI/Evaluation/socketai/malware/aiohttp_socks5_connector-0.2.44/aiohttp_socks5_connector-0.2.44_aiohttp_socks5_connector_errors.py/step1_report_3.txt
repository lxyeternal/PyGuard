  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; classes are solely definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions with no malicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions for exception handling, specifically tailored for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from standard exceptions, with no embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard setup for error handling in a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. It is a benign, standard pattern for error handling in network-related Python modules.",
