  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- They consistently state there are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, with no embedded logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating certainty in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code contains only class definitions for exceptions; there are no issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities present.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is purely structural, serving as error handling scaffolding.\n\n**3. Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- The reports' assigned scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores:**\n- Since there's no actual code behavior beyond class definitions, assigning higher risk scores isn't justified.\n- The code does not execute any malicious activity or handle untrusted data.\n\n**5. Malware considerations:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on its structure, which is justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n- No inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all the above, I concur with the reports' evaluations.**\n\n**However, to be thorough, I will provide my own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0-1) | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present.                                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear class definitions with no obfuscation.                                 |\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.                             |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, serving as a structural component for error handling.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code snippet is very low risk. It’s a standard pattern for defining exception classes, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
