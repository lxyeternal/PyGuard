  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors for use in network applications.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard exception types. It does not include any data handling, input/output, or potentially malicious operations. The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple collection of exception class definitions intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
