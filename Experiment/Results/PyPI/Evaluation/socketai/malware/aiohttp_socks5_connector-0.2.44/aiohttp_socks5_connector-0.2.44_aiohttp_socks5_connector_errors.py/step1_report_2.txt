  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; this code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. No input handling, no data processing, no network activity, or other operations are present. The classes are straightforward and serve to categorize errors related to SOCKS proxies and general connection issues. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard, safe error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only harmless, standard exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
