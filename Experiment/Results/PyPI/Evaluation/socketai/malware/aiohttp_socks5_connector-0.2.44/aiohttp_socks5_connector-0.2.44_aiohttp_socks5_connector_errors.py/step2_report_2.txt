  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign, and intended as part of a larger error handling framework.\n\n**Confirming the presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: it's a set of exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The class hierarchy and inheritance are straightforward and typical for such error handling modules.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- They correctly conclude that the code is purely structural, with no security risks.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities justifies any higher risk score.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or executable content.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Any claim suggesting potential vulnerabilities would be speculative; the code is purely class definitions.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis: zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- No security issues or malicious activity are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, harmless set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
