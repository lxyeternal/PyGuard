{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present; no data read operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input or output, present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from existing exception classes, to handle specific SOCKS proxy errors and related proxy errors. There are no data input operations, no external connections, no code execution, or other potentially malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard exception class definitions, indicating no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger proxy handling package.",
