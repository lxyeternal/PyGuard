  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes; no data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares exception classes without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. No executable logic, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is standard, benign, and structurally simple, with no anomalies or suspicious features. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is purely structural and lacks any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
