  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution of embedded scripts that contain network and system manipulation functions. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as establishing remote control or exfiltrating data. The use of encoded payloads and environment-dependent paths further supports this. The malware score (0.85), obfuscation score (0.9), and security risk score (0.9) are justified and reflect a high threat level. Overall, this code should be considered malicious and dangerous."
