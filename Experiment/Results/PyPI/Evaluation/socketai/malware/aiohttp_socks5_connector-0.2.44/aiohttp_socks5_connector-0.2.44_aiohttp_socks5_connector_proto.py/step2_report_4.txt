  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the provided code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with standard socket communication, address resolution, and error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, following standard protocols, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Evaluation:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The risk score is appropriately zero; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward SOCKS proxy handling, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), and a small security risk (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with proper handling of proxy negotiation and authentication. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:** The scores are reasonable. The malware score remains zero; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on asyncio SOCKS proxy wrappers, with proper management of network connections, address resolution, and error handling. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:** Consistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with correct handling of network operations, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:** No discrepancies. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming standard, benign SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:** The scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Potential Malicious Elements\n\n- **Malware score (0):** All reports agree on no malicious activity. The code is a typical SOCKS proxy client implementation, with no suspicious payloads, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** The code is clear, readable, and uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Risk score (0.2):** Slightly elevated, likely due to the handling of untrusted data, but justified given the network context. No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious logic.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate; standard network code with minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nThe code and reports are consistent, and the scoring accurately reflects the benign nature of the implementation. No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are aligned with the provided reports and the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asyncio in Python, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
