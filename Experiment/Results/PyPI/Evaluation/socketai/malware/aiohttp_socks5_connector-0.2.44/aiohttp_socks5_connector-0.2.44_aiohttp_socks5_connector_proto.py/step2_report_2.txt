  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a straightforward, legitimate SOCKS4/SOCKS5 implementation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. It notes proper error handling, standard protocol adherence, and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.0\n\n- **Justification:** Given the code's clear structure, standard library usage, and absence of suspicious logic, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard protocol implementation, proper handling of network responses, and no malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2) due to the handling of user credentials and untrusted data flows.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation. The small risk score accounts for potential mishandling of credentials or untrusted data, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper with proper management of address resolution, negotiation, and authentication. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The code appears legitimate. The risk score remains low, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion: a standard implementation with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Proper error handling and protocol adherence.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The scores are consistent with the code's apparent benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Proper handling of network communication and errors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The consistent pattern across all reports supports the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in most reports (0.2), reflecting minimal concern over handling untrusted data or credentials, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asyncio, with proper error handling, protocol adherence, and no suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to handling untrusted data, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
