  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, user credentials, and network responses from proxy servers.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through socket send/receive operations, address resolution, and authentication steps, potentially exposing data or affecting network state if malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) → socket operations (connect, send, receive) → proxy negotiation and authentication → established proxy connection for further data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments detected. Error handling is standard, and code structure is clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asyncio-based SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy client implementation. It performs expected functions such as address resolution, proxy negotiation, optional authentication, and error handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are present. The code handles untrusted data appropriately, with no signs of data leakage or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure. The overall assessment indicates a benign, legitimate implementation with minimal inherent security risk due to network operations, but no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are justified and appropriate. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
