{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket connections, enabling proxy negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data during socket communication, address resolution, and authentication steps.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially influence the socket data sent or received, especially in the _send and _receive methods, and during address resolution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like user-provided hostnames and ports through address resolution and proxy negotiation functions, and back to socket send/recv operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are apparent. The code uses standard libraries and methods for network communication. No suspicious or unusual logic is present; exception handling is typical for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers using asyncio, with functions for address resolution, socket communication, and proxy negotiation. The error handling aligns with expected behavior for network protocols. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious activity is detected. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other malicious actions. It strictly adheres to standard proxy negotiation procedures. The use of exception handling, socket operations, and protocol-specific details are consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients for asynchronous Python applications. It contains no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs typical network proxy operations with appropriate error handling. No security risks are identified in the provided code segment.",
