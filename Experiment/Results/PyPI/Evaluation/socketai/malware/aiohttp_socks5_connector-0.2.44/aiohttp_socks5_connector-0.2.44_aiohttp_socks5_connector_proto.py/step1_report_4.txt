{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, facilitating network connections through these proxies in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports for destination and proxy servers, provided via class initializers and method parameters. Data is also read from network sockets during negotiation and communication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into socket send methods (e.g., _send, sendall), and data read from sockets during negotiation (e.g., _receive, _read_binded_address). Potential leaks or effects could arise if data is mishandled or mishandled errors lead to exposure.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames/ports → DNS resolution or IP conversion → socket communication with proxy server → proxy negotiation data exchange → data flows through socket after connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to follow standard SOCKS protocol implementations; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Exception handling covers typical network errors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementations (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5). It performs network operations such as DNS resolution, socket connection, and proxy negotiation following standard protocols. Error handling is appropriate, raising specific exceptions for various failure conditions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are observed. The use of external libraries (asyncio, socket) is standard. The code is well-structured for intended functionality, with no evidence of malicious payloads or unintended data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for Python, with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected network operations securely and transparently, focusing on proxy negotiation and connection management without suspicious behaviors.",
