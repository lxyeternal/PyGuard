  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, legitimate SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy client implementation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code aligns with standard proxy client implementations, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent. The high confidence (1.0) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the correctness and standard nature of the implementation. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slight security risk score (0.2) accounts for the potential of untrusted data flows, which is standard for network code handling user input and network responses. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard asyncio SOCKS proxy wrapper, with proper handling and no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate. The code's structure and behavior do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms standard implementation, no backdoors, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No suspicious elements are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify or find any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques are present.\n- **Security Risk:** The minor security risk scores (0.2) are justified due to handling untrusted data, network communication, and address resolution, which are inherent to proxy client code but do not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's content.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor inherent risks in network handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asyncio, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.**",
