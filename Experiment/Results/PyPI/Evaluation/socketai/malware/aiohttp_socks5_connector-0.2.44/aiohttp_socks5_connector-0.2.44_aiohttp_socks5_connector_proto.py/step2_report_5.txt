  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a straightforward SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy client, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The report correctly identifies that the code implements standard proxy negotiation procedures.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.\n- The code handles errors properly, and no backdoors or hidden behaviors are detected.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- The scores seem appropriate.\n- The confidence is high (1.0), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SOCKS proxy implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to general network code, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- Confidence (0.9) matches the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as above; standard asyncio SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code is standard, with proper handling.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- The scores seem justified.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code is consistent with typical proxy client implementations.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Confidence matches.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same conclusion; legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code is standard, with no hidden behaviors.\n- No suspicious flows or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict**:\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- Confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports agree on 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated**: All reports give 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score**: Slightly elevated at 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if the code is embedded in malicious projects, but not inherently risky.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated**: **0** — the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk**: **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal risk, primarily related to potential misuse, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code strictly implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The potential risk is low but acknowledged, as proxy code can be misused.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The existing scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- I would maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 (or slightly lower, e.g., 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the implementation.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
