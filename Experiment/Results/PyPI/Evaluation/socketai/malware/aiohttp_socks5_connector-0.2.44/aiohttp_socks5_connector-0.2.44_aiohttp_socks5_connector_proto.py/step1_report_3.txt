{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection wrappers for asyncio, enabling asynchronous proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, username/password (for authentication), and network addresses resolved via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket connections, data sent over the network, and address resolutions. No evidence of data leakage or malicious data exfiltration is present.",
  "flows": "Flow begins with resolving hostnames, establishing a socket connection to the proxy server, performing negotiation and authentication, then connecting to the destination address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. Use of standard libraries and patterns suggests normal proxy connection handling. No obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides asyncio-based SOCKS proxy connection wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), with methods for resolving addresses, negotiating connections, and handling authentication. It correctly manages network connections and exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears focused on legitimate proxy handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages proxy negotiations and connections without suspicious or malicious modifications.",
