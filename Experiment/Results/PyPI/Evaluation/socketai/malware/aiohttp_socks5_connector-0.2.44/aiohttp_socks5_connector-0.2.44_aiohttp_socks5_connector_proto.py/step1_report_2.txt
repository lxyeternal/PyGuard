{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate network connections through proxies, supporting different authentication methods and address resolutions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from network responses via socket.recv, address resolution functions, and user-provided configuration parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the network via sock_sendall, and socket connections are established via sock_connect. Potential untrusted data flows include the handling of proxy server responses and user credentials.",
  "flows": "Input data (from network or user config) flows into functions like negotiate() and _build_dest_address(), with data sent over sockets and responses parsed to determine subsequent actions. User credentials, if provided, flow into authentication requests. Network responses flow into response handlers for validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy protocols without any obfuscated code, hidden dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are evident. No unusual behaviors or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection handling with support for multiple versions and authentication methods. It carefully manages socket connections, address resolution, and protocol-specific message exchanges. Error handling appears standard, raising specific exceptions for network or protocol issues. The code does not include any network activity outside the expected proxy communication, nor does it contain suspicious or malicious payloads. There are no signs of data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The use of standard libraries and clear protocol implementation indicates a typical, legitimate proxy client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a SOCKS proxy client wrapper without any malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to standard protocol implementations, with no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. Its purpose aligns with normal network proxy operations.",
