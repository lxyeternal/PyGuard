  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate proxy connector implementation with no malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score seems appropriate given the functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles proxy configuration and URL formation, with no malicious behavior. It relies on external functions, but nothing suspicious is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Proxy URL construction from user inputs is standard, and no anomalies are observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages proxy settings, with no signs of malicious activity. External functions are assumed safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The code's purpose is proxy management, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard proxy connector, handling credentials securely, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, the code manages proxy connections with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which matches the code's content—no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports rate 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.2, reflecting low to moderate concern, mainly due to handling of user-provided proxy credentials and URL formation. This is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, but acknowledging potential misconfigurations or misuse of credentials)\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The use of external functions for socket creation and URL parsing is typical.\n- Handling user credentials in URLs is standard but could pose security concerns if inputs are untrusted; however, this is a common pattern, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments are necessary.",
