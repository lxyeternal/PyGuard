{
  "purpose": "Provides a proxy connector implementation for aiohttp supporting various proxy types, DNS resolution, and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy_type), external functions create_socket_wrapper and parse_proxy_url, URL formation from user inputs.",
  "sinks": "URL formation with credentials, socket connection via create_socket_wrapper, external URL parsing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> socket creation -> connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs proxy URLs dynamically, including credentials if provided, which is standard. It uses a custom NoResolver for DNS, and external functions for socket creation and URL parsing, which appear legitimate. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The code handles credentials securely within URLs, though care should be taken in deployment to avoid logging sensitive info. External functions are assumed safe; no evidence suggests malicious behavior. The overall structure and logic align with typical proxy handling code. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
