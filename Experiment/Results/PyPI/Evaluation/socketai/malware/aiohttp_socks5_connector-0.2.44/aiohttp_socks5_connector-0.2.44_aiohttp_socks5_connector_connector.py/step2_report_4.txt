  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the scores assigned, and any potential inconsistencies or overlooked risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements a proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting HTTP and other proxy types.\n- Proxy parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy_type) are used to generate URLs and establish connections.\n- External functions like `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are used, but their internal behaviors are unknown.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL manipulations, or obfuscated code are observed.\n- The code appears to follow standard patterns for proxy handling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score aligns with the code's behavior. The high confidence score seems justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher security risk perhaps due to the dynamic URL construction. Still, no malicious indicators.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The mention of a `NoResolver` class and socket wrapping is standard. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's legitimate proxy management purpose.\n- **Verdict:** No issues with scores.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, matching the clear and straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious activity, these are reasonable. The only potential concern is reliance on external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), but without evidence of malicious behavior, this remains low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0. as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0. as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is acceptable, considering the handling of credentials and external functions, but not indicative of a serious risk.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to handling of credentials and external functions, but no evidence of vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or security flaws evident from the provided snippets and reports.",
