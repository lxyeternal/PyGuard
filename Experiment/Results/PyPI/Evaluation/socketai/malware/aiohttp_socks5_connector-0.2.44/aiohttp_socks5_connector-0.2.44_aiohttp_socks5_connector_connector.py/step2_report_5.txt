  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements a proxy connector with support for DNS resolution, proxy URL generation, and connection handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the functionality. The high confidence score aligns with the review.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nNo issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines classes for proxy handling, with dynamic URL creation and socket wrapping. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears legitimate. The proxy URL is constructed from user inputs, which is standard. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The slightly higher security risk (0.2) accounts for potential misconfiguration or external input handling, which is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements custom DNS resolution and proxy connection logic, with external socket wrapper functions. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe use of a NoResolver class for static DNS resolution is typical. External functions are assumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk score remains appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection management with standard URL and socket handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code handles proxy credentials securely within URL formation and does not perform any suspicious operations. The external functions are standard. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection setup with dynamic URL creation and socket wrapping. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll data flows and operations are standard for proxy handling. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—standard proxy connection handling without any malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal potential risks related to handling user inputs and proxy configurations. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious behavior, a risk score around **0.1** to **0.2** is justified, considering potential misconfigurations or external inputs.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, standard proxy handling)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is a legitimate proxy connector with no security concerns based on the provided information.",
