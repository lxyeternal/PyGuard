{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL in parse_proxy_url(), reading user info from URL, receiving host, port, and proxy configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers, connecting to specified hosts and ports, opening network connections via asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection().",
  "flows": "Input data from URL parsing and function parameters flow into socket wrapper creation, which then connects to specified targets; proxy credentials flow from URL or parameters into socket setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. No unusual behaviors or hidden code detected. No use of insecure functions or unsafe practices beyond standard async socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles network connection setup through SOCKS proxies with proper parameter parsing and error handling. It validates host and port inputs, parses proxy URLs, and supports multiple proxy types. It creates socket wrappers accordingly and connects asynchronously to target servers. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The code relies on standard libraries and external dependencies for proxy handling but does not include any malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for proxy-based network connection management without malicious intent. It handles user input securely, validates parameters, and uses established async networking practices. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
