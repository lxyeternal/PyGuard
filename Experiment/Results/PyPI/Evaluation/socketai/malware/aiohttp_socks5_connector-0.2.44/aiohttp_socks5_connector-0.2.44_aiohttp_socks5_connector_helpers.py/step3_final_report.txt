{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and managing network connections with validation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters (host, port, proxy URL), socket creation functions, and connection initiation points.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio's open_connection and create_connection functions, potentially connecting to untrusted proxies or hosts.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, proxy URL) -> parse_proxy_url -> create_socket_wrapper -> connect -> asyncio.open_connection or create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Validation is appropriate, and external modules are standard for proxy handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection setup with proper validation and URL parsing. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. It relies on external libraries for proxy handling, and the logic is straightforward. The only potential concern is the acceptance of untrusted proxy URLs, which could be misused but is typical for such utilities. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score reflects the inherent risk of accepting external inputs but does not indicate malicious intent.",
