      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its heavy obfuscation, system manipulations, privilege checks, and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent. It should be flagged as malicious and considered unsafe for execution. The high obfuscation and system-level actions justify maximum malware and risk scores."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code and reports suggest minimal to moderate security concerns primarily due to obfuscation and potential dynamic execution in Report 2. No concrete evidence of malicious activity was found. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments for a more conservative estimate. Overall, the dependency appears relatively safe but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation or dynamic features are present."
