  "security_risk": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code and reports suggest minimal to moderate security concerns primarily due to obfuscation and potential dynamic execution in Report 2. No concrete evidence of malicious activity was found. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments for a more conservative estimate. Overall, the dependency appears relatively safe but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation or dynamic features are present."
