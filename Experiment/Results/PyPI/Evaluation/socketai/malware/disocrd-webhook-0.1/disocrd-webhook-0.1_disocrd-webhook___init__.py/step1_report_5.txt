  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible; no functional description or comments indicating intent are present.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, function parameters, or possibly environment variables if used; specific data sources are not explicitly identifiable due to the absence of the actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file operations, or data outputs. Without the actual code, specific sinks cannot be precisely identified.",
  "flows": "Flow paths from sources to sinks cannot be determined without concrete code; generally, untrusted input could flow into sensitive operations such as network or file access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hard-coded credentials, suspicious variable naming, or unusual code constructs, can be identified without the actual code snippet.",
  "analysis": "No code provided for review. As a result, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. In the absence of the code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to perform a code review due to lack of code content. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks can be assessed without seeing the actual source code.",
