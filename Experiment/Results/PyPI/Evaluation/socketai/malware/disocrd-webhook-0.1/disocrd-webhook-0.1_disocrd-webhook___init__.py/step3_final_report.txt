  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables leading to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unusual control flows, hidden backdoors, inconsistent patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for malicious indicators, obfuscation, and security issues. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 indicate no code or benign code, with scores reflecting low risk. Report 2 shows obfuscation and potential dynamic behavior, warranting moderate suspicion. Scores in reports generally align with the described content. Given the ambiguity in Report 2, the malware score is conservatively set at 0.2, obfuscation at 0.5, and security risk at 0.4. Adjustments suggest lowering malware slightly to 0.2 and obfuscation to 0.3 for a balanced assessment. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low to moderate suspicion without definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code and reports suggest minimal to moderate security concerns primarily due to obfuscation and potential dynamic execution in Report 2. No concrete evidence of malicious activity was found. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments for a more conservative estimate. Overall, the dependency appears relatively safe but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation or dynamic features are present.",
