{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations, potentially for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reading input from user input (e.g., input()), environment variables, or external files (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing data to files, printing output, or network communication if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output statements or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Lack of external network communication or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library imports without suspicious patterns. No evident data leaks, credential handling, or malicious behavior. The flow appears straightforward, with no complex or hidden behaviors. Absence of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. Overall, the code's structure suggests benign utility or data processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with standard operations. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
