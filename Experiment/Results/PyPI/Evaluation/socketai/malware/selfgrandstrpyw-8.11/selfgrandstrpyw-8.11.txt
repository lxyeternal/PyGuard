      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicating malicious activity such as remote code execution or payload delivery. The obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression elevate the security risk. The package should be treated as malicious, and further analysis (e.g., decoding the payload) is recommended."
