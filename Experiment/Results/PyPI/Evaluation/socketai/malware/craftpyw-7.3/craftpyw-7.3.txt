      "conclusion": "The code exhibits typical malicious tactics—obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state—warranting high suspicion. The high scores assigned are justified given the behavior. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence indicates a significant security risk."
