{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom proxy connectors for aiohttp, supporting SOCKS proxies and chaining, enabling network requests through specified proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URLs parsed via parse_proxy_url, external input parameters for proxy configuration.",
  "sinks": "Network connection establishment via proxy.connect, potentially exposing data if malicious proxies are used.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing -> Proxy creation -> Connection through proxy -> Data transmission over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. No backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of proxy handling classes, dynamically creating proxies based on external inputs. It uses well-known libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External inputs could be misused if malicious URLs or credentials are supplied, but this is outside the scope of static code analysis. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering potential misuse via external inputs, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
