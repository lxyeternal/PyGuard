  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of custom proxy connectors using `python_socks` and `aiohttp`.\n- It supports SOCKS proxies, proxy chaining, and custom DNS resolution (via `NoResolver`).\n- Proxy URLs are parsed dynamically; no hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The logic is standard for proxy handling; no signs of backdoors or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Proxy connection classes for aiohttp, SOCKS5, chaining.\n- No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is legitimate, standard proxy setup.\n- No issues found.\n- The risk score (0.2) seems reasonable, considering external input reliance.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on proxy chaining.\n- No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code's behavior.\n- Proxy chaining is a common pattern, no malicious implications.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Focus on input data from URLs and parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Valid; the code handles proxy configuration securely.\n- External inputs are expected; no malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Proxy chaining, SOCKS support, standard network routing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No malicious code detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical proxy connector implementation.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Proxy connectors for network communication, no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- Input data is from parameters, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n- The risk score reflects typical concerns about untrusted input, which is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are suitable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports seems reasonable given the potential for misuse if untrusted proxy URLs are supplied, but no malicious code is present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external input reliance, but no active malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of proxy connection classes supporting SOCKS proxies and chaining, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.\n\n**Your final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with my detailed analysis.",
