{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SocksConnector class for proxy connections, providing warnings to use a new connector and handling SOCKS proxy versions.",
  "sources": "Imports warnings, third-party proxy exceptions, and a local ProxyConnector class; defines class constructors and methods that initialize proxy settings.",
  "sinks": "Calls to super().__init__() and class method from_url() which may process external data such as URL parameters or kwargs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_ver, url, kwargs) flow into class initializations and method calls, which invoke superclass methods potentially processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or file operations; straightforward class inheritance and warning issuance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a SocksVer class for SOCKS proxy version constants. It implements a deprecated SocksConnector class that issues a warning when instantiated or used, encouraging migration to ProxyConnector. The constructor and from_url class method call the superclass methods, passing along parameters that could originate from external sources. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard wrapper or compatibility code for proxy handling, with appropriate deprecation warnings. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious implementation of a deprecated proxy connector with proper warnings. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
