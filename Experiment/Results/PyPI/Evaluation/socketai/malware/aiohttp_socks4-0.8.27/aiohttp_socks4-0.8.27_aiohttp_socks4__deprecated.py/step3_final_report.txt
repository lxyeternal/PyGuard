{
  "purpose": "Defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that issues warnings and delegates to an existing proxy connector implementation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'proxy_type' in kwargs, 'socks_ver' argument, and the 'url' parameter in from_url method.",
  "sinks": "Delegated superclass methods that may process input data; no direct untrusted data handling observed in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into superclass methods via super().__init__() and from_url(), which are not shown here but are assumed to handle data accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; deprecation warnings are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an existing proxy connector, issuing deprecation warnings and supporting SOCKS versions. It delegates core functionality to parent class methods without processing untrusted data directly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecated wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
