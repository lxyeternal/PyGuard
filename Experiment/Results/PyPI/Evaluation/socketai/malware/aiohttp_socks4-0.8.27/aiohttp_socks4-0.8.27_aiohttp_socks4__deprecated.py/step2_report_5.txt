  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines constants for SOCKS versions.\n- It defines a deprecated `SocksConnector` class that wraps around `ProxyConnector`.\n- It issues deprecation warnings upon instantiation and usage.\n- It delegates core functionality to the parent class (`ProxyConnector`) via `super()`.\n- It reassigns exception classes from external modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as a deprecated wrapper issuing warnings.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, as it's just a warning wrapper)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining classes/constants with deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted input or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on SOCKS version handling and deprecation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, just class inheritance and warnings.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, emphasizing deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity, straightforward wrapper.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Similar, focusing on proxy connection setup with deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low, as it's just managing proxy setup with warnings)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a benign, straightforward wrapper around an existing proxy connector, with deprecation warnings issued for legacy classes.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero obfuscation across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily related to deprecation warnings and delegation, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and behavior, a low risk score of **0.1** is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector wrapper. It issues deprecation warnings and delegates core functionality to an external class, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
