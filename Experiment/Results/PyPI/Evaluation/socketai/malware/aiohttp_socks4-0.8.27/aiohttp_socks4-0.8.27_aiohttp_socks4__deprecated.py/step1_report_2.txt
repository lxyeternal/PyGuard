{
  "purpose": "Define a SOCKS proxy connector class and related constants, with deprecation warning for an older class.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class initializers, and method definitions",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involve untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "Initialization of SocksConnector, usage of class methods, warnings emitted during class instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Use of a deprecated class with a warning, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network connections",
  "analysis": "The code imports proxy handling components, defines constants for SOCKS versions, and creates a SocksConnector class inheriting from ProxyConnector. It issues a deprecation warning when used, guiding users towards a new class. The from_url method wraps a superclass call, and the code reassigns proxy error classes. No untrusted input processing, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The deprecation warning and class inheritance appear standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, mainly defining classes and constants with a deprecation warning. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
