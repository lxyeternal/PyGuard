  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, assess the scores, and ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector that wraps an existing implementation, issuing warnings, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code matches the description: it issues deprecation warnings, defines constants, and wraps superclass methods without processing untrusted input directly.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines SOCKS proxy class with deprecation warning, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears straightforward, with class inheritance, constants, and warnings. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No untrusted data processing or network activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, defines a SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warning, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code, which mainly issues warnings and delegates to superclass methods.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines a deprecated SocksConnector with warnings, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code issues deprecation warnings, calls superclass methods, and manages proxy parameters. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 are justified.\n- **Justification:** No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar class with deprecation warnings, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code matches the description; no untrusted input processing or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seems slightly higher but still low, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) may reflect the fact that class methods accept external parameters that could originate from untrusted sources, but since the code only delegates to superclass methods and issues warnings, this is minimal.\n- **Recommendation:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 might be more appropriate unless further context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code's nature.\n- For report 5, consider lowering the risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 for consistency with the others, unless there's an external reason to keep it higher.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly due to delegation and warnings, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate, with only a minor suggestion to standardize the risk score in report 5. Overall, the code appears safe and well-understood.",
