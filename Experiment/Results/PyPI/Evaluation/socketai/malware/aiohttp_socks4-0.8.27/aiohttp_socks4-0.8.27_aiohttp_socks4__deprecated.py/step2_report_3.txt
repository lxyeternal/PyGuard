  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of proxy connector classes, with deprecation warnings guiding users to a new class (`ProxyConnector`).\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of warnings for deprecation is standard practice.\n- External modules are used for proxy handling, and the classes mainly delegate to parent class methods.\n- The potential external inputs are `kwargs` and `url` parameters, which could originate from untrusted sources, but there's no evidence of unsafe handling or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define deprecated SOCKS proxy connector with warnings.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; straightforward wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (low, just a deprecation warning).\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard practice.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just class inheritance and warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Deprecated SOCKS connector with warnings.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; standard wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy class with deprecation warning.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; manages proxy connection setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (slightly higher, but still low).\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard wrapper for proxy connection handling, with deprecation warnings.\n- No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only potential concern is the processing of external inputs (`kwargs`, `url`) in superclass methods, but since the code delegates to external classes (`ProxyConnector`) which are assumed to be safe, there's no evidence of malicious handling.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThe code is a benign, standard wrapper for proxy connection management, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; the assessments are accurate.",
