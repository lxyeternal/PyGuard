{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that extends a generic ProxyConnector, including warnings about deprecation and handling different SOCKS versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class initializers, method calls, and usage of external modules like python_socks and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Superclass constructor calls, warnings, and class method from_url which could process external input data.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters (socks_ver, kwargs) flow into superclass constructor; from_url method receives external URL input and calls superclass method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of deprecated warnings is standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SOCKS proxy connector class with a deprecation warning, supporting different SOCKS versions and flexible initialization via kwargs. It uses external modules for proxy error handling and issues warnings to inform users about deprecation. The class relies on an external ProxyConnector class and the python_socks library. No malicious or suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present. The code seems to serve as part of a larger proxy handling library, with standard practices and no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector class with deprecation warnings. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate within the context of a proxy handling library.",
