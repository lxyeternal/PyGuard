{
  "purpose": "Define a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that wraps around an existing proxy connector implementation, providing backward compatibility and warnings for deprecated usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules ('warnings', 'python_socks'), and class/variable definitions within the code (SocksVer, SocksConnector, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as super().__init__() and super().from_url(), usage of warnings.warn, and class instantiation with parameters.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts with class and function definitions, uses warnings during class initialization and method call, and calls parent class methods for initialization and URL parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network calls or data exfiltration observed. Usage of warnings for deprecation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy-related constants, a warning function about deprecation, and a proxy connector class that wraps an existing connector. It employs standard Python practices, with no obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper and deprecated interface notification without any hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a deprecated proxy connector wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only issues warnings about deprecation and delegates functionality to a parent class.",
