{
  "purpose": "Defines a SocksConnector class for proxy connections with SOCKS protocol versions and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "import statements, class initializations, method calls",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn, super().__init__, super().from_url",
  "flows": "Constructor and method calls potentially passing user or external input through 'kwargs' and 'url' to super() methods",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated method warning, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports proxy-related exceptions and a connector class. It defines a class for SOCKS proxy handling, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with deprecation warnings for an older connector class. The constructor adapts based on provided arguments, and the from_url class method facilitates URL-based instantiation. No user input processing appears unsafe or malicious. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected, nor any data leaks, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward proxy connector class with deprecation warnings, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily manages proxy connection setup and warns users about deprecated usage.",
