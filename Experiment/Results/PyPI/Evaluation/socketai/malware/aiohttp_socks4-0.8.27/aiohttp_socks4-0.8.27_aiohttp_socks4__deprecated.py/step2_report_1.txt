  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around an existing proxy connector, providing deprecation warnings and supporting SOCKS proxy versions.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard practice, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The external modules and classes used are well-known and do not suggest malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1 (Report 1):**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; straightforward wrapper with warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, just a minor deprecation concern).\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score seems appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2 (Report 2):**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Issue 1, defining a SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; standard class inheritance and warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3 (Report 3):**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines SOCKS proxy connector with deprecation warning, handling SOCKS versions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score is appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4 (Report 4):**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar deprecation wrapper with SOCKS version support.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; straightforward inheritance and warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5 (Report 5):**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines SOCKS connector with deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard class design.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the mention of 'potential' external input processing, but no actual risky behavior is evident. It might be slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Very low across all, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting the benign nature and deprecation warnings.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The deprecation warnings and class inheritance are standard practices, not security issues.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minor deprecation-related concerns, not security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with appropriate deprecation warnings, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.",
