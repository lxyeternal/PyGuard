  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports: they implement asynchronous proxy connection functions using `python_socks` and `asyncio`.\n- The code performs input validation, proxy URL parsing, proxy object creation, socket connection, and then opening or creating network connections.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The functions rely on standard libraries and third-party modules (`python_socks`), with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is legitimate and safe, with malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident from the code snippets.\n- **Potential improvements:** None identified; the code appears correct and secure.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- **Logical accuracy:** The reports correctly identify the purpose, data flow, and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Misleading claims:** No misleading or false claims are present.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Security risk scores (~0.1-0.2):** These are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware scores (0):** Correct, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores (0):** Correct, no obfuscation is evident.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n\n- The reports assign a high confidence (0.9) and low security risk, which is appropriate.\n- The overall scoring appears consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, reflecting standard network connection code with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate proxy-based network connections securely and legitimately.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is standard and safe.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious activity or payload present.                   |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Code is clear, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation.    |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2               | Slightly above zero due to network connection handling, but no vulnerabilities detected. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate; no modifications needed. The code is a standard, secure implementation for establishing proxy connections in asyncio-based applications.",
