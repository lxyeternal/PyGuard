{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies using asyncio and python_socks.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters (host, port, credentials), and external proxy configuration.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio stream creation, potentially untrusted proxy URLs or credentials.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> parse_proxy_url (if proxy_url provided) -> proxy creation -> connect socket -> open/create connection with socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing proxied network connections asynchronously. It validates inputs, parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and manages socket connections using well-known libraries. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and usage are typical for such utilities, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security implications depend on external inputs, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for proxy-based network connections. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
