  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to SOCKS proxy handling for the aiohttp-socks library, including version info, proxy types, errors, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from python_socks library, relative imports from connector and utils modules, deprecated module imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network transmission, or system modifications are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up exports and imports, with no data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of version declaration, module imports, and export definitions. All imported modules and functions appear to relate to proxy handling, error types, and utility functions. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations within this code snippet. It functions as a module setup without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization script for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy support, with no malicious code or security concerns identified.",
