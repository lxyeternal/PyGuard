{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module for handling SOCKS proxy connections, providing classes and errors related to proxy management and connection utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks' library, relative imports from local modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code primarily imports and exposes classes and functions. No data is read from untrusted sources or sent to external destinations.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to module attributes, exposing them for external use; no data flows from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward imports and export definitions with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various exception classes, types, and utility functions from both external and internal modules, then defines __all__ to specify what symbols are exported. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network activity in this snippet. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an interface point. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file for a proxy-related library, exposing classes and functions for external use. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and legitimate.",
