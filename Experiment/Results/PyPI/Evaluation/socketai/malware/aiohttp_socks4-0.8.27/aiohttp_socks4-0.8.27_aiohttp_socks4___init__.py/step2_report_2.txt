  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup (__init__.py-like) for the 'aiohttp-socks' package.\n- They note that the code only performs static imports from external and internal modules, then defines `__all__` for public API exposure.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports assign high confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- The presence of deprecated modules suggests legacy support but not malicious intent.\n- The code's purpose is purely to re-export classes and functions related to SOCKS proxy handling, errors, and utilities.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- No issues are apparent; the code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script.\n- The inclusion of deprecated modules could be flagged for maintenance but does not impact security.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, legitimate, and typical for a Python package's __init__.py.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming the code's benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe module setup with no malicious or security concerns.",
