{
  "purpose": "Module initialization for 'aiohttp-socks', defining package metadata and exposing classes/functions related to SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from external ('python_socks') and internal modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated). No dynamic input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Imports from external/internal modules serve as sources; no data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export setup. Deprecated modules are included but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py-like module setup, importing classes and functions for a SOCKS proxy library, then defining __all__ for public API. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The inclusion of deprecated modules indicates legacy support, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
