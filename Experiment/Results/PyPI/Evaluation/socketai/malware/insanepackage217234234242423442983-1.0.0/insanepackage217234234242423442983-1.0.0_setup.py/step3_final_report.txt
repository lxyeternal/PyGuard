{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it via exec(), indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded encrypted payload and decryption key; it also imports modules requests and fernet during install.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded encrypted payload and key -> decryption with Fernet -> execution via exec() -> potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encryption key and payload, execution of decrypted code during installation, nonsensical package metadata, and obfuscated descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a hardcoded payload with Fernet during Windows installation and executes it via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The package metadata is nonsensical, likely obfuscated. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during install is suspicious and potentially dangerous. The high likelihood of malicious behavior is supported by the encrypted payload, obfuscation, and execution pattern. Scores assigned by reports (malware ~0.85-0.9, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9) are consistent with this analysis. The code pattern aligns with common malicious tactics, and the high scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent, including encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets. It should be considered highly malicious and avoided.",
