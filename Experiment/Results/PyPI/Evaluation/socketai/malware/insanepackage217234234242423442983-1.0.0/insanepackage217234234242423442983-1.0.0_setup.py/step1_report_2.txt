{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom install command that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, importing requests and fernet modules, decrypting and executing Fernet-encrypted code within run() method",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potential network requests via requests module, decryption of encrypted payload",
  "flows": "os.name detection -> conditional import of requests and Fernet -> decryption of code -> execution via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted code, presence of encrypted payload that is executed at install time, decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, obfuscated description and long description text, no clear purpose of the package",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command 'GruppeInstall' which, during installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload appears to be obfuscated and is likely intended to run arbitrary code. The code runs during package installation, which is suspicious. The package name, author info, description, and long description are all nonsensical or obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. The use of decrypted code execution during install poses a significant security risk, as it could execute malicious code on the host system. No other safe or benign behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems, which could be malicious. The obfuscated descriptions and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent. Therefore, this package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
