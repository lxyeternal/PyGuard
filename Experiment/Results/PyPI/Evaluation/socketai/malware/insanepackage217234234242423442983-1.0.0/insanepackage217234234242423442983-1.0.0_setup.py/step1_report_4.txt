{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes custom installation steps, including decrypting and executing code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), and imports modules such as os, requests, and fernet during installation. It also decrypts and executes code via Fernet during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network requests through 'requests', and importing potentially malicious modules or code during installation.",
  "flows": "The code checks OS type, then conditionally executes Fernet-decrypted code, which is run via exec(). The decrypted code could perform any malicious activity, including network communication or system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted code that is decrypted and executed dynamically during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The long description strings are nonsensical, possibly obfuscation. The package name and author info are obscure and do not follow standard naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with added malicious intent. It decrypts and executes code during installation using Fernet, which is commonly used for secure encryption but here appears to hide malicious payloads. The presence of hardcoded encryption key and encrypted payload, combined with dynamic execution, is suspicious. Importing modules like requests and Fernet within the installation method suggests potential network activity or data exfiltration capabilities during install. No other malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage is explicitly visible outside the decrypted exec() call, but the pattern is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains deliberate obfuscation and dynamic execution of encrypted code, which strongly indicates malicious intent. The installation process executes decrypted code, potentially enabling malicious actions such as system compromise or data exfiltration. The package exhibits high malicious behavior potential and should not be trusted.",
