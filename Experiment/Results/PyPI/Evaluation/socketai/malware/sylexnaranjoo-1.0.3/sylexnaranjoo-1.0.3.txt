The invalid dependency 'sockets' should be corrected to prevent installation issues. Overall, the code is safe but warrants review of the package source and metadata to clarify intent."

It contains functions that exfiltrate sensitive user data, execute destructive system commands, and manipulate system settings without user consent. The assigned scores are consistent with its capabilities and intent, warranting classification as high-severity malware with maximum security risk."
