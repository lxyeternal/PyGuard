  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign with superficial anomalies in metadata and dependencies. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The invalid dependency 'sockets' should be corrected to prevent installation issues. Overall, the code is safe but warrants review of the package source and metadata to clarify intent."
