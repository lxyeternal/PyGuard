  "purpose": "Collect system metrics and send them to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP GET request with requests.get().",
  "flows": "Data from os.uname(), os.getcwd(), and socket.gethostname() flows into URL parameters of requests.get() to send system info remotely.",
  "anomalies": "The URL endpoint appears obfuscated or maliciously crafted, and the data is sent to a suspicious domain. No input validation or encryption is used, and the URL is hardcoded with a seemingly random subdomain.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information (OS name, current directory, hostname) and constructs an HTTP GET request to an obfuscated domain. The URL endpoint looks suspicious and could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The use of socket.gethostname() and os.uname() to gather system info is typical, but the domain name appears malicious. No validation or encryption mechanisms are present, indicating potential data leakage or malicious tracking. The code is simple but its intent seems to be remote data collection, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to a suspicious, obfuscated domain. While the code itself is straightforward, the purpose seems to be remote monitoring or exfiltration of system data. There are no signs of malware such as reverse shells or data theft beyond data exfiltration, but the suspicious URL and data collection pattern warrant caution.",
