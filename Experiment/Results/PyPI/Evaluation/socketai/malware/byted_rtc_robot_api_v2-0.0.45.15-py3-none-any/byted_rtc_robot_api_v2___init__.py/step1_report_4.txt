  "flows": "Source functions (os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()) -> URL construction -> requests.get() call to send data",
  "anomalies": "Constructed URL contains a suspicious domain and path that do not resemble legitimate or well-known endpoints. No validation or encryption of data before transmission. The URL appears to be obfuscated or maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for network requests, environment info, and socket details. It retrieves OS name and release, current directory, and hostname. It then constructs a URL with these details embedded as query parameters, and sends an HTTP GET request to a domain that appears suspicious and non-legitimate. The purpose seems to be to exfiltrate system information without user consent or awareness. The URL’s domain is obfuscated, suggesting potential malicious intent. No authentication or encryption mechanisms are present, increasing risk of data interception. The code is simple but indicates possible data collection for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers basic system information and exfiltrates it to an obfuscated domain. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration, possibly malicious. The URL and lack of user notification are concerning, indicating malicious intent or a security risk.",
