  "purpose": "Collect system metrics and send them to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.uname(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() function call that sends data over the network to a suspicious URL",
  "flows": "os.uname() -> osname_str -> requests.get() with URL containing system info; socket.gethostname() -> URL parameters",
  "anomalies": "The URL appears to be a suspicious, obfuscated domain, and the data sent includes hostname, OS info, and current directory, which could be used for fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as OS name, current working directory, and hostname. It then constructs a URL with this data embedded as query parameters and performs an HTTP GET request to an obfuscated domain. The domain appears suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could be used to exfiltrate system details without user consent. The code does not perform any other actions, and no user input is involved. It looks like basic telemetry but the nature of the URL and data suggests possible malicious intent related to system fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and exfiltrates it to a suspicious external URL, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. The URL and data collection are potentially malicious, and the activity warrants further investigation.",
