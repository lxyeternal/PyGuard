  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external URL",
  "flows": "osname_str, cwd, and hostname are concatenated into a URL parameter and sent via requests.get() to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a URL with system information and sends it without any validation, but no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info such as OS name, current working directory, and hostname. It then composes a URL with these details and makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain with a long, non-descriptive subdomain. The purpose appears to be gathering and exfiltrating system data. There is no obfuscation, malicious payload, or command execution. The data exfiltration could be considered privacy-sensitive, but it does not involve malicious payloads or code injection. The domain and URL structure seem suspicious but could be a legitimate tracking or monitoring service; without further context, it’s hard to confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code mainly performs data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system info and sends it to a remote server, which could be used for malicious tracking or privacy invasion. No malicious payload or obfuscation detected, but the exfiltration of system details to an obscure URL raises security concerns.",
