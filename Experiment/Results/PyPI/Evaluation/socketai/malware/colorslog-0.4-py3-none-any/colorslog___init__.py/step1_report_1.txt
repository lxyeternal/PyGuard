{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive data such as Discord tokens, system information, and user details from various browsers and system components, then exfiltrate this data to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads local storage and leveldb files from browser directories, environment variables, and system commands to retrieve tokens, hardware ID, and IP address.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, including tokens, user info, and system details.",
  "flows": "Reads data from browser storage and system commands (sources), decrypts tokens, collects user/system info, and then transmits this data over the network to a remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs, attempts to decrypt tokens from local browser data, and exfiltrates data to an external Discord webhook. No input validation for external data; presence of credential harvesting logic; no apparent user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules to access system information and browser storage. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, decrypts them using Windows-specific functions, and verifies their validity via Discord API requests. If valid, it gathers user info, IP address, and hardware ID, then constructs an embed message with this data. The information is sent secretly to a specified Discord webhook. The script operates silently, accessing sensitive user data without consent, and exfiltrates this data over the network, indicating malicious intent. No obfuscation or evasion techniques are detected beyond straightforward code. The core purpose appears to be credential theft and system data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a token stealer and information harvester targeting Discord user data, system info, and IP address. It exfiltrates this data to an external Discord webhook, confirming malicious intent and significant security risk. The script is clearly designed for malicious purposes, with no legitimate utility.",
