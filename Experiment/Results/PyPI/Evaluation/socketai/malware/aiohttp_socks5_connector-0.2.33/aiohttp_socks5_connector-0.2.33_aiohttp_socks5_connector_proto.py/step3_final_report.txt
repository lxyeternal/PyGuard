{
  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client protocols with address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Hostnames, ports, credentials, and server responses during socket connection and negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted hostnames, credentials, and server responses that influence connection and authentication processes.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flow into address resolution and authentication steps; socket data exchange occurs during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with proper error handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The code handles untrusted inputs as expected for a proxy client, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical proxy handling risks without inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
