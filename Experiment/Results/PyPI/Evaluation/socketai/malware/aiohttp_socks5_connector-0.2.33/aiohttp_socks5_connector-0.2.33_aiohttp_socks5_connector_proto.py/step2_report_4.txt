  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of proxy client code that handles untrusted inputs but does not inherently contain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears functionally correct and free of evident vulnerabilities.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or covert channels.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning that the code is a standard proxy implementation is sound.\n- The conclusion that the code is safe and legitimate is justified.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2) reflects the fact that proxy code can be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is standard and not specific to this implementation.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Low, consistent with proxy code handling untrusted inputs but not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The overall security posture is low risk, and the code appears safe for use.",
