{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to enable network connections via proxy servers, supporting connection negotiation, address resolution, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket streams via sock_recv and sock_sendall methods; resolves hostnames using getaddrinfo; reads authentication credentials (if provided).",
  "sinks": "Sends data to socket streams for negotiation and connection; potentially writes username and password for SOCKS5 authentication; resolves and encodes hostnames; connects to proxy servers.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication steps, then sent over socket streams; server responses are received and parsed to confirm connection; data is transmitted or received through the socket after successful negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; code appears to follow standard SOCKS protocol implementations; no obfuscated or suspicious language features; no external data exfiltration or malicious system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers. It includes address resolution, optional username/password authentication, and connection negotiation with error handling. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present. The code manages socket connections securely by avoiding blocking calls, and it properly handles exceptions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious network activity. It strictly adheres to SOCKS protocol specifications, and all data flows are consistent with legitimate proxy connection processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not exhibit suspicious or harmful activity beyond normal proxy connection handling.",
