{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate network connections through proxies asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, username/password (for SOCKS5 authentication), and network address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over the socket connection during negotiation and data transfer; address resolution and socket connect functions could be influenced by untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Untrusted hostnames and ports flow from input parameters to address resolution, then through the SOCKS protocol negotiation, ultimately leading to socket connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a SOCKS proxy client; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident. Error handling is straightforward and based on expected network conditions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously. It performs address resolution, socket connection, and SOCKS protocol negotiation, including authentication for SOCKS5 if credentials are provided. It relies on standard socket and asyncio libraries and does not include any obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. All inputs are handled explicitly with validation, and the code follows expected patterns for proxy communication. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The overall design appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles inputs and network operations securely within the expected scope of a proxy client. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
