{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, including negotiation, address resolution, and connection handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data during socket communication (_receive), address resolution (_resolve_addr), and during the authentication and connection negotiation processes (e.g., _socks_auth, _socks_connect). It also reads configuration data such as host, port, username, and password from parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data sent via _send and sendall methods; socket connection establishment; potentially untrusted address resolution outputs. The code does not directly execute untrusted data but processes inputs and network responses.",
  "flows": "Source inputs include user-provided host, port, credentials, and network responses from SOCKS server. These flow into socket communication and address resolution functions, influencing connection setup and authentication. Data flows from inputs into socket communication and address resolution, with responses being processed for connection success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for proxy handling; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, and no network communications to suspicious domains are present. Exception handling is appropriate. No hidden backdoors or malicious code is identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection procedures, including SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 negotiation, address resolution, and socket management. It uses asyncio event loop for asynchronous socket operations, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or covert channels. The code handles errors appropriately and avoids unsafe practices like executing untrusted data. It also does not contain any suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Overall, it functions as a typical proxy client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous connections. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage features. There are no indicators of malware or security risks beyond typical network connection handling. The overall security risk is low, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
