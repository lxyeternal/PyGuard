{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, facilitating connections through proxy servers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostname and port inputs, environment variables if used externally, and socket responses during negotiation (e.g., server reply codes).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket connections, data sent over sockets during negotiation, and data received from proxies that influence connection flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (host, port, credentials) through address resolution and negotiation routines to socket send/recv operations; server responses determine further control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No suspicious or misleading code patterns. The code performs standard proxy negotiation and socket handling with proper error handling. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly implements proxy connection logic for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with appropriate error handling, address resolution, and authentication steps. It uses standard network functions and asyncio patterns. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No sensitive data is hardcoded; credentials are passed as parameters. The code's structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on its current logic. It performs expected proxy negotiation and connection tasks securely. However, reliance on external inputs (like hostnames and credentials) warrants secure handling elsewhere, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
