  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "None identified; no handling of untrusted data or external inputs within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Imports flow from module files into the namespace; no data processing or untrusted input flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected; only module imports, constant definitions, and exports are present",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines import statements, error classes, constants, and exports for a module. No data processing, input handling, or external network activity occurs. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module definition file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup file for a proxy library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It contains only straightforward import and export statements.",
