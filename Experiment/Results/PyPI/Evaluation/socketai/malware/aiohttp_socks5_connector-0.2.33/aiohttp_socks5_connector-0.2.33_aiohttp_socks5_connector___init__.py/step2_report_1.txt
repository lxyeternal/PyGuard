  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard module setup, with imports, exports, and versioning.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as an interface or initializer for a proxy library.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent in this code snippet.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and cautious, correctly identifying that the code is benign.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The scores reflect the benign, structural purpose of this module.",
