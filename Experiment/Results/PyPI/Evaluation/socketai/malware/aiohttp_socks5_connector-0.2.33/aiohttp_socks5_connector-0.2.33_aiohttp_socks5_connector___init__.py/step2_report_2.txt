  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code snippets are all standard module initialization files, primarily consisting of import statements, versioning, and export definitions.\n- There are no signs of dynamic data processing, network activity, or external input handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical setup for a proxy library, specifically for SOCKS proxy handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as defining module metadata, imports, and exports for a proxy package.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no data leaks, no anomalies, and no suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Completely benign, standard module setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to report 1, identifying the code as part of a proxy connection library.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, non-malicious module setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no issues identified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Again, identifies the code as related to proxy connection handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard module initialization, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining and exporting classes/functions for SOCKS proxy.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical package setup, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Standard module setup with imports and exports.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, network calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious. Given the nature of the code, the malware score should be **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation is not present. The obfuscated score should be **0.0**.\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is negligible; the code does not perform any runtime operations, network activity, or data handling that could pose a risk. The risk score should be **0.0**.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard module setup with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the nature of the code.",
