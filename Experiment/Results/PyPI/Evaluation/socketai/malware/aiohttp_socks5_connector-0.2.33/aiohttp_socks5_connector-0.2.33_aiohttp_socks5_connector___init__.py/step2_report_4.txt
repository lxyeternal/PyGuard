  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, that imports classes, error definitions, helpers, and constants from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n   - It sets a version string and does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not read external data, handle untrusted input, or write data to external sinks.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - The structure is typical for a package setup or interface module, with no runtime operations or network activity.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0), and no anomalies or issues are identified.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 — The code shows no malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 — No security risks are evident in this static setup code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is purely structural and import/export definitions, it cannot be malicious on its own.\n   - Any malicious activity would have to originate from the imported modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, `.helpers`, `.proto`), but those are not part of this snippet, and the reports do not suggest issues there.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation**:\n- The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.\n- The provided scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes to scores are necessary based on this analysis.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0\n\nThis code fragment is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
