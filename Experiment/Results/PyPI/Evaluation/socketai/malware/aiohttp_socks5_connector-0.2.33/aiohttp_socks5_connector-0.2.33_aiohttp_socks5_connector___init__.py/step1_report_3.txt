  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, defining imports and module metadata for establishing and managing SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes related to proxy connection handling, error management, and helper functions from within the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling, network transmission, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows within this code fragment; it mainly sets up imports and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level imports, versioning, and exports without performing any runtime operations, data processing, or network activity. All imported components are typical for a proxy library. The structure appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
