  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators of Malware:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a standard module setup, consisting solely of import statements, error class definitions, versioning, and export declarations.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated segments, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the code.\n   - The code appears syntactically correct and follows typical Python module conventions.\n   - No misconfigurations or insecure practices are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, indicating no security risks identified.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as a benign module setup.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign module initialization script with no security concerns.**",
