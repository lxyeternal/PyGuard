{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package related to implementing or managing proxy connections, specifically SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; and the setting of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points for untrusted data. The code mainly involves importing modules and defining exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly defined in this snippet; it is primarily import and export statements without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module initialization script. It imports specific classes and functions from other internal modules, sets version info, and defines what is exported when the module is imported. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or any suspicious patterns present. The code structure and content do not suggest any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy-related package. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
