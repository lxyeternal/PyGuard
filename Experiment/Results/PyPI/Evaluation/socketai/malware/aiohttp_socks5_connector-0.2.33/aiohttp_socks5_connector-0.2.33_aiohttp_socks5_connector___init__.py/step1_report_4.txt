{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes, error types, and helper functions related to proxy connections, likely for handling SOCKS proxy operations.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or network operations are performed within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports and re-exports symbols; it does not contain data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "This file serves as an initializer or interface for the package, importing and exposing relevant classes and functions. There are no dynamic code execution, external data inputs, or network operations here. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code segments. The code appears to be standard for a package that handles SOCKS proxy functionalities, with clear and maintainable structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports components for external use without executing or processing data itself.",
