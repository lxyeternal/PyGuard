  "purpose": "Module initialization and export definitions for a proxy handling library, setting version and exposing classes/functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export setup.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports without runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing classes, error definitions, helpers, and constants, then exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or credentials are present. The code's simplicity and structure indicate a benign purpose, serving as an interface or initialization module for a proxy library. The absence of runtime logic or external data handling confirms no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
