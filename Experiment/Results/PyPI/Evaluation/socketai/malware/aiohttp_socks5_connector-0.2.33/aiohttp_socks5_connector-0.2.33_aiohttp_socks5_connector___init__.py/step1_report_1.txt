  "purpose": "This source code defines module metadata, imports, and exports for a proxy-related Python package, facilitating proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read in this code; imports are from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks are present; the code only sets up module exports and imports functions/classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely manages imports and exports, with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic are present. The version string is standard, and no dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, exception class definitions, and module export declarations. It lacks input handling, data processing, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are found. The code appears to be a standard module setup without any harmful components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security, leak data, or contain malware.",
