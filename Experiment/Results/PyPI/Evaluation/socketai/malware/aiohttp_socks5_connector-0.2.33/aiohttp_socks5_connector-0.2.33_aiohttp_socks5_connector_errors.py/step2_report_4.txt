  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines multiple custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from standard exception types, and there is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The code is purely structural, serving as error categorization.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Are the reported issues present in the code?\n\n**Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning or summary?\n\n**No significant errors.** The reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent. They correctly note the absence of data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Minor note:** The reports do not mention whether the exception classes are used elsewhere or if the hierarchy is appropriate, but given the scope, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue\n\nAll reports assign:\n- **malware:** 0\n- **securityRisk:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **confidence:** 1\n\nThese seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** Since the code is purely structural and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, the scores are appropriate. No changes needed here.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5\n\n**No.** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n\n**All reports correctly assign malware score = 0.** The code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n\n**No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities**; the reports correctly identify that the code is just exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report\n\nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n\n**Given the analysis:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all be **0**.\n- Confidence remains **1**.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \nWhile the code itself is benign, in a real-world scenario, such exception classes could be part of a larger, potentially malicious package if combined with malicious logic elsewhere. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0                   | No signs of malicious code or behavior                      |\n| obfuscated      | 0                   | Clear, straightforward class definitions                     |\n| securityRisk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky patterns observed               |\n| confidence      | 1                   | The analysis is certain based on the code provided          |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign and serves as a standard error handling structure for SOCKS proxy implementations.",
