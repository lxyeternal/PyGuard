  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; exception class definitions do not involve data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data output, no untrusted data handling, no external communication or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; the code only declares exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "This code defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, data handling, or runtime logic. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling modules in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes used for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, harmless module.",
