  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code content, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and consistency of scoring.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network activity, or other operational logic. The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Appropriate, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity or indicators are present.  \n- **Security Risk (0):** Justified, since the code only defines exceptions without any exploitable logic or data handling.\n\nAll reports assign high confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**  \nSince all reports agree on the benign nature, no higher risk scores are warranted. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is transparent and readable.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code only defines exception classes, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of class definitions for error handling. It poses no security risk, contains no malicious activity, and is fully transparent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary.",
