  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external inputs are involved.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is straightforward class definitions. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is benign, purely structural code with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Correctly 0. Since the code only defines exceptions, there's no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports mention \"no external input or data sources,\" \"no data flow,\" and \"no suspicious patterns,\" which are accurate.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scoring is appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's harmless nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No changes needed. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.",
