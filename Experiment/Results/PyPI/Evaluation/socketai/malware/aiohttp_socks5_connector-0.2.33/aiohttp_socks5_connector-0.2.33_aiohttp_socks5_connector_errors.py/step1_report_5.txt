{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; these are exception class declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations for handling SOCKS proxy errors. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present. It appears to be a standard error hierarchy setup. No malicious intent or security issues are evident from these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic setup of custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It is purely structural with no executable logic that could cause harm or data leakage.",
