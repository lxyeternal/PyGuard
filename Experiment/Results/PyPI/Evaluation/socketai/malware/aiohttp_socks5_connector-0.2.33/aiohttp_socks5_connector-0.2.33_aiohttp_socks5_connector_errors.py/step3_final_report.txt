{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors, serving as error handling structures.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no data input or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; purely structural code with no runtime data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or runtime execution beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for various SOCKS proxy error exceptions, inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no data processing, network activity, or malicious logic. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code content, and no issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
