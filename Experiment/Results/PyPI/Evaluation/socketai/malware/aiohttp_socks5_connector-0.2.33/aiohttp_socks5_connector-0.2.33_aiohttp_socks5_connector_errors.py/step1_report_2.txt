{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code solely defines exception classes with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, which is standard practice in Python. There are no imports, dynamic execution, or logic that could be exploited. The classes serve as exception types and do not perform any malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The absence of code beyond class definitions indicates a straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only class definitions for exception handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger SOCKS proxy or network-related library.",
