  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or network activity. The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the analysis. Since there's no malicious activity or obfuscation, these scores are reasonable. The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any risk above 0.5. Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious content, this is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They stick to the facts: class definitions with no runtime logic or network activity.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
