  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output pathways; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains class definitions for various exception types related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. It uses inheritance properly, with no dynamic code, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The classes are standard and straightforward, serving as custom exceptions for error handling. Overall, the code appears to be a benign component of a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
