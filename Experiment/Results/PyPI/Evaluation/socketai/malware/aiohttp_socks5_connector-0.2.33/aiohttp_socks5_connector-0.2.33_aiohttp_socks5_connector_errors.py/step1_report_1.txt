  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; code only defines exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes; no unusual or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling related to SOCKS proxy connections. No input handling, data processing, or network activity occurs. The classes are used to categorize different error conditions. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions. The structure is standard and clear, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely defines exception classes for error handling purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
