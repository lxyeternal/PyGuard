  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n- They consistently note the absence of data handling, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, indicating they are well-founded.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, and no security risks are identified.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions inheriting from base exception classes.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious functions.\n   - Confirmed: **No issues are present in the code.**\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - No suggestions for changes are necessary; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - Malware: 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correct given the code clarity.\n   - Security Risk: 0, appropriate for such class definitions.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification needed.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious intent.\n   - Exception classes are standard and serve error handling.\n   - Malware score remains 0, which is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code content.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, purely structural, and standard for error handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, harmless set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors to be concerned about.",
