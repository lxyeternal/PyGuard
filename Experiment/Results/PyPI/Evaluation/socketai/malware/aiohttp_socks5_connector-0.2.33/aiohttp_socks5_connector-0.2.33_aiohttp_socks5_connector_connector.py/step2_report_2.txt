  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified across all reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The code handles proxy URL parsing, socket creation, and connection management securely, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- Proxy URL construction uses user inputs, which is standard.\n- Socket wrapping and connection handling are typical for proxy implementations.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No evident errors or flaws in the reasoning of the reports.\n- The code's logic aligns with standard proxy connection handling.\n\n### Scores:\n- The **malware score** is 0 in all reports, which seems appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The **security risk** scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by the standard handling of proxy parameters and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that the external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are secure and do not introduce vulnerabilities. Without their implementation, this cannot be fully verified, but their usage appears standard.\n- The code does not perform any validation or sanitization of user inputs (like proxy URL components). While this isn't inherently malicious, improper validation could lead to issues in real-world use, but not necessarily malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, justified by standard proxy handling)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the provided scores, reflecting low but non-zero residual risk due to external dependencies and input handling)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code appears secure, standard, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
