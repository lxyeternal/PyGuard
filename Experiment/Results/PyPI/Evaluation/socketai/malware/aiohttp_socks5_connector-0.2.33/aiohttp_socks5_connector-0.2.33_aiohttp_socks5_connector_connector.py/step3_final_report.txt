{
  "purpose": "This code implements a custom proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting HTTP and other proxy types, with dynamic URL construction and socket wrapping for non-HTTP proxies.",
  "sources": "User-provided proxy URL components, external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` for socket creation and URL parsing.",
  "sinks": "Proxy connection establishment, socket connection, and URL formation; no untrusted data flows directly to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL -> parse_proxy_url -> create_socket_wrapper (for non-HTTP proxies) -> socket connection -> connection setup via aiohttp's `_wrap_create_connection`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External functions are assumed standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a proxy connector, with proper handling of proxy URL formation, socket wrapping, and connection management. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security flaws are evident. The use of external functions is typical, and no suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and logic align with standard practices, and no obfuscation or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
