{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and handling socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function parameters, including proxy URLs, host, port, username, and password. It also parses URLs to extract proxy details.",
  "sinks": "The code establishes socket connections and opens network connections using asyncio, potentially transmitting data over the network.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing (source) -> creation of socket wrapper (sink) -> connection establishment (sink) via asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard libraries and well-structured proxy handling functions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses proxy URLs to extract connection parameters, creates appropriate SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, and establishes network connections asynchronously. It includes error handling for missing or invalid parameters and supports both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies. The functions perform expected operations without executing or executing untrusted code or data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors. Usage of external libraries appears standard for proxy handling. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection handling for network operations. No malicious or maliciously disguised behaviors are present. It operates as a proxy client utility without evident security risks or malware indicators.",
