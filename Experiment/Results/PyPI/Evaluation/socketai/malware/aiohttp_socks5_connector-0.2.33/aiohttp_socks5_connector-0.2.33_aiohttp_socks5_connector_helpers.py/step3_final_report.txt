  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with URL parsing and socket wrapper creation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters (host, port, credentials), external socket wrapper classes",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio's open_connection and create_connection calls",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() extracts proxy type, host, port, credentials -> create_socket_wrapper() creates socket -> connect() initiates connection -> asyncio.open_connection() or create_connection() uses socket",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; proper error handling; standard use of external libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It correctly parses proxy URLs, handles untrusted inputs with validation, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages connections via asyncio. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The input handling is typical for proxy clients, with error handling in place. External dependencies are used for socket wrapping, and the code is clear and well-structured. The security risk stems from untrusted input handling, but no active vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified; the slightly elevated security risk score (~0.2) reflects the inherent risks of handling untrusted inputs but does not indicate active threats.",
