  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing socket connections via proxies, for use in asynchronous network operations.",
  "sources": "URL parsing in parse_proxy_url(), function parameters (socks_url, host, port, username, password), and user input via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "socket.connect(), asyncio.open_connection(), loop.create_connection(), and creation of socket wrappers, which initiate network connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_url, host, port, credentials) -> parse_proxy_url() or direct parameters -> create_socket_wrapper() -> connect() -> open_connection() or create_connection() -> asyncio network functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses untrusted input to construct proxy URLs and connection parameters without additional validation or sanitization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed. No data exfiltration or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, including parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers accordingly. Inputs such as URLs and connection parameters are used to configure sockets and initiate connections. The code relies on external libraries for socket handling and URL parsing. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious side effects. All data handling appears standard and intended for legitimate network proxy operations. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious data leaks, unauthorized data access, or command execution. It does, however, accept and process untrusted inputs (proxy URLs and connection details), but this is typical for network client code. No evidence of malicious intent or harmful side effects was found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections in an asynchronous Python environment. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only concern is the handling of untrusted input parameters, which is typical for such network code but should be used with caution in production environments. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
