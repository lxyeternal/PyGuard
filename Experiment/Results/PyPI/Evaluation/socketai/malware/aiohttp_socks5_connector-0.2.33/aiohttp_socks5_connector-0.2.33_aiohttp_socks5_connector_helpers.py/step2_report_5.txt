  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the reports' assessments, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish network connections asynchronously.\n- Uses external libraries (`aiohttp_socks5_connector`) for socket handling.\n- Handles untrusted input (proxy URLs, host/port, credentials) but does so in a standard manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or remote code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- It relies on untrusted inputs (proxy URLs, host, port), which is typical for such network utilities, but this could be exploited if misused (e.g., connecting to malicious endpoints). However, this is a known risk inherent to proxy clients, not a flaw in the code.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No evident logical flaws or mistakes in the code.\n- Error handling appears correct.\n- Proxy URL parsing is straightforward and handles unquoting properly.\n- The functions enforce necessary parameters.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.9), consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justifications for risk scores:\n- The overall risk is low because the code is a standard proxy connection utility.\n- No malicious intent or malware detected.\n- The only potential concern is misuse with malicious endpoints, but that is outside the scope of the code's intent.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis. Given the code's purpose and structure, this is justified.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect             | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious code, payload, or backdoors present.                            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.                                    |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2               | Slightly elevated due to untrusted input handling, but standard for proxy code. The code itself is safe. |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection management in Python. It is well-structured, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain malicious behaviors or obfuscation. The potential security concern is the handling of untrusted inputs, which is inherent to proxy clients but does not constitute a flaw in the code itself.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current low malware and obfuscated scores.  \n- Keep the security risk score at ~0.2, acknowledging the inherent risks of proxy configurations but noting that the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that such code is used in controlled environments and with trusted proxy endpoints to mitigate potential misuse.",
