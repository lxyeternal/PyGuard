  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code content and behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n   - The code contains only static metadata: package name, version, license, authors, email, description, keywords, and package list.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, external data fetching, or network activity.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is typical for packaging a Python project for distribution.\n\n2. **Presence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities**:\n   - Based on the code provided, there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n   - The reports consistently note the absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The email and author details are static and typical for such scripts.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the static analysis.\n   - Since the code is static and straightforward, there are no grounds to increase malware or risk scores.\n\n5. **Final evaluation**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard setup script.\n   - No modifications or additional risks are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a typical, safe package setup script with no security concerns.",
