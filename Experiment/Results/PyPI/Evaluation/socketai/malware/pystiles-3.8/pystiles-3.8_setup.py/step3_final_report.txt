  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, defining package metadata such as name, version, authors, and description.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within the setup() function: name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is static; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, or obfuscated code. All reports agree that this is a benign, standard packaging script. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
