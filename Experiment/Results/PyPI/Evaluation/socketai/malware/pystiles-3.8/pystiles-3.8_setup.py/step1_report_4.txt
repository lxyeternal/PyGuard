{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pystiles' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, license, authors, email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code does not handle user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and predefined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the script is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or potentially malicious logic. It does not include any network operations, credential handling, or code injection points. The structure is typical for a Python package setup, and all data is hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves its purpose of defining package metadata without any suspicious or harmful content.",
