  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pystiles'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, license, authors, email, description, keywords, and package list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or inputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic flows; data is static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script using setuptools with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata. All data is hardcoded or statically defined. No input reading, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources or untrusted inputs. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and configuration.",
