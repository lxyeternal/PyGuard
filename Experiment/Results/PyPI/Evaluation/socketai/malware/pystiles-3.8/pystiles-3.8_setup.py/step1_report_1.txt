  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution of the 'pystiles' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical actions are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata values are assigned to setup parameters without involving untrusted data sources or complex data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code uses standard setuptools setup syntax.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static metadata values. No dynamic execution, no external data input, no potential injection points. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The content appears to be a typical package setup configuration for distribution on PyPI.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines metadata for the package.",
