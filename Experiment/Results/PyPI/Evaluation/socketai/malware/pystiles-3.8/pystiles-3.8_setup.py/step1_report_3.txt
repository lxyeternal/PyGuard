{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the Python project 'pystiles'.",
  "sources": "Input data from the setup() function parameters such as name, version, license, authors, author_email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the parameters involve untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform any I/O operations or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is declarative and does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code structure is standard for a setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure package metadata. It defines package details like name, version, license, authors, contact email, description, keywords, and package list. All data appears to be hardcoded metadata without dynamic or external input. There are no code injections, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate packaging and distribution of the project.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is straightforward and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration file with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
