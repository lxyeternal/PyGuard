{
  "purpose": "Provides command-line entry points for the py_pkg module, specifically to install a package template from GitHub.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (argv), takes user input (input()), downloads data from a GitHub URL via requests.get, reads and extracts ZIP file.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() fetches data from an external source; open() writes a file; remove() deletes a file; input() takes user input that could influence flow.",
  "flows": "User input determines whether install_template_from_github() runs; requests.get() retrieves remote ZIP; file operations save, extract, and delete temp.zip.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; no insecure SQL or dangerous system commands; use of requests for downloading is typical but could be misused if URL is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments and user input to control flow; upon 'install' command, it downloads a ZIP archive from a public GitHub URL and extracts it. No sensitive data handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no unsafe system operations are present. The URL points to a public repository, reducing risk. The code structure is straightforward, and functions perform expected tasks. Potential concern is the download of external content based on user input, but since the URL is fixed and known, this does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard operations: command parsing, user prompt, downloading and extracting a ZIP file from a known URL. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The only minor risk is reliance on external URL, but it is a static, public resource. Overall, low risk.",
