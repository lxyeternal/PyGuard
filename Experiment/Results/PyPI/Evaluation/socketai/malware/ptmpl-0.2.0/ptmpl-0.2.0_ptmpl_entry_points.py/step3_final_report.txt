  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to install a package template by downloading and extracting a ZIP archive from GitHub.",
  "sources": "User input via sys.argv and input(), fixed URL for ZIP download.",
  "sinks": "Writing ZIP file to disk, extracting ZIP contents, deleting ZIP file.",
  "flows": "User command triggers download; URL content is written to 'temp.zip'; ZIP is extracted into current directory; 'temp.zip' is removed.",
  "anomalies": "No validation of ZIP content; exception objects are created but not raised; no checksum or integrity verification of downloaded ZIP.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward download and extraction operations with user confirmation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The main security concern is the lack of ZIP validation, which could be exploited if the URL is compromised. The code's behavior is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to missing validation. Error handling is minimal, but this does not impact security directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a simple installer script. The primary security concern is the absence of ZIP validation, which could be exploited if the remote URL is compromised. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.",
