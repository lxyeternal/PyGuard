{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line interface functionality for the py_pkg package, specifically for installing a GitHub-hosted template project by downloading and extracting a ZIP archive.",
  "sources": "Input from sys.argv (user command), input() from user prompt, network request via requests.get(), reading from and writing to 'temp.zip', reading the ZIP file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'temp.zip' (file write), extracting ZIP contents into current directory, removing 'temp.zip' file.",
  "flows": "User command (argv[1]) → install_template_from_github() (if 'install') → user prompt for confirmation → requests.get() to download ZIP → writing to 'temp.zip' → extracting ZIP contents → deleting 'temp.zip'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; user confirmation is a simple prompt; no data leaks or sensitive info handling; download URL is fixed; no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs; no direct data exfiltration or malicious system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward command-line utility that downloads a ZIP archive from a fixed URL, extracts it into the current directory, and cleans up. It involves user confirmation before proceeding. No code injection, credential theft, or malicious system access is present. The network request is directed at a known GitHub URL, with no indication of malicious intent. The code does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it performs a benign function with standard library usage and explicit user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple installer for a template project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
