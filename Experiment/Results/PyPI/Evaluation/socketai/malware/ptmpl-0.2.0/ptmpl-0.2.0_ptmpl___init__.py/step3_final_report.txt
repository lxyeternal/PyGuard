  "purpose": "The code is a simple descriptive docstring outlining a Python package template, intended solely for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "There are no sources; the code contains only a static string (docstring) with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code is purely static documentation with no execution or data transfer paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only a plain docstring with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable, static documentation string describing a package template. It contains no functions, classes, or code logic, and does not perform any data processing or external interactions. All review reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely descriptive docstring with no executable or malicious elements. All reports are accurate, and the security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
