  "purpose": "Template project for developing new Python packages, intended as a cookie-cutter scaffold.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only contains comments and docstring definitions.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None, no executable code, data flow, or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only descriptive comments and package description; no code, data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a module docstring describing the package purpose. There are no functions, classes, data processing, or input/output operations. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present. As such, there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation evident. The code is a straightforward template with no executable or potentially harmful elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation and boilerplate with no executable logic, no security issues, and no malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard package template used for scaffolding new projects.",
