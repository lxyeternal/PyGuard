  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a multi-line string (docstring) describing a package template, with no executable code, data processing, input/output, or external interactions. It is purely descriptive.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is just a docstring with no executable logic or data handling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports consistently describe the code as benign, containing only documentation.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review:\n\n1. **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n   Yes. Since the code contains no executable parts, no data flow, and no suspicious patterns, a malware score of 0 is justified. Similarly, obfuscation isn't present, and security risk is negligible.\n\n2. **Is there any potential for misclassification?**  \n   No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n   No. All assessments are based on the content, which is just documentation.\n\n4. **Any issues with the reasoning?**  \n   No. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe scores across all reports align with the actual content. The code is a benign template, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a non-executable, purely descriptive docstring with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat.",
