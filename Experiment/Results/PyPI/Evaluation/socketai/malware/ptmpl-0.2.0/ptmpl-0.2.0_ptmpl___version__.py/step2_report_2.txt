  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The provided code is a typical `__version__.py` file containing package metadata.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for Python package metadata.\n\n2. **Report Content and Errors:**\n   - All five reports indicate an \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - This suggests that the reports did not provide any meaningful analysis, evidence, or findings regarding the code or package.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there are no claims of vulnerabilities, malware, or issues to evaluate.\n   - Without additional context or details, there's no basis to identify flaws, malicious activity, or security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence or findings, any scores for malware, obfuscation, or risk should be minimal or zero.\n   - The absence of information does not indicate malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The code itself appears benign.\n   - The reports are uninformative; thus, no assumptions can be made about hidden issues.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Based on the provided code and the empty reports, I would assign the following scores:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to lack of information; slightly above zero to acknowledge the absence of evidence but not indicating concern)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is clean and standard.\n- The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n- Scores should be low, reflecting no detected malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis approach aligns with critical review principles, emphasizing evidence-based assessment.",
