  "purpose": "Contains package metadata for the py-package-template project, including version, author, license, and URL.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata variables defined within the file (__title__, __description__, __version__, etc.). No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package metadata file with no malicious or suspicious content. All reports provided are empty, indicating no analysis or findings. Given the simplicity and transparency of the code, there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The absence of detailed reports prevents any identification of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of issues. The package appears safe, and no further action is necessary.",
