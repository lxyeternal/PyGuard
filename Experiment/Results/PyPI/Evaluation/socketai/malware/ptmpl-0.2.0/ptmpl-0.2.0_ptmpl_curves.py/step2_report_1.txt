  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to determine the accuracy of the security evaluations.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations of the Code:**\n\n- The code models supply and demand curves with validation for monotonicity.\n- It calculates equilibrium prices and ranges based on input data.\n- It simulates economic shocks by shifting prices.\n- Uses numpy arrays for numerical operations.\n- Exception classes enforce data integrity.\n- No network, file I/O, or external system interactions.\n- No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets.\n- The logic is straightforward and domain-appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; models economic curves, computes equilibrium, simulates shocks.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; data flows into constructors, functions, and methods without external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious; straightforward code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate and consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard implementation, no malicious indicators.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, perhaps due to mention of numpy, but still negligible)\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Proper modeling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate zero, which aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — standard numerical modeling library with no evident security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a clean, domain-specific economic modeling library with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) is acceptable given the context; overall, the security posture is very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
