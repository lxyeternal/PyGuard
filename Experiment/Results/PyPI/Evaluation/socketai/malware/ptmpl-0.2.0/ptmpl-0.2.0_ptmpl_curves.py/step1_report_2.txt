{
  "purpose": "This module models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices, and simulates economic shocks, providing a library for economic analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters such as 'data' for supply and demand curves, and class attributes like '_price' and '_quantity'.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in functions like 'equil_price' and 'equil_price_ranges' to determine equilibrium points, and in class methods for curve adjustments. No untrusted data inputs or external sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Source data (curve input data) flows through sorting and validation; then to quantity calculations. The 'apply' methods modify curve data by adding shocks, and the equilibrium functions analyze these curves to find prices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Exception classes enforce data validation, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or misleading variables detected. The only notable aspect is the use of numpy for array operations, which is normal in numerical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data validation, numerical computations, and object-oriented modeling of economic concepts. It raises specific exceptions for non-monotonic supply/demand data, which is consistent with domain rules. The 'apply' method in 'HorizPriceShock' modifies curves by shifting prices, which is a legitimate modeling approach. No network access, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are detected. The structure adheres to typical Python data modeling with no signs of obfuscation or malware tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, domain-appropriate implementation of economic supply/demand modeling and shock simulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. It operates within its intended scope and follows standard practices. No security risks or malware are detected.",
