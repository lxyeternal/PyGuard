{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks. It serves as a library for economic analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input sequences of dictionaries containing 'price', 'supply', or 'demand' keys; constructs numpy arrays; and receives class instances as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs comparisons, sorting, and mathematical operations, but no explicit data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class constructors, which process and validate it; functions like equil_price and equil_price_ranges compute based on these data structures; the Shock classes modify curves by applying price shifts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden data leaks, are present. The exception classes and the main functions are straightforward. No external system access or data exfiltration code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly models economic curves using numpy arrays, performs validation for monotonicity, sorts data, and computes equilibrium prices/ranges through deterministic calculations. The apply methods for shocks adjust prices by adding shock values, which is consistent with expected behavior. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured economic modeling library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign economic modeling library with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators and adheres to standard coding practices for its domain.",
