  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details with the code, and evaluate the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code models supply/demand curves, reads data from dicts with 'price', 'supply', 'demand'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows from input to class constructors, functions compute equilibrium, shocks modify curves.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external system access.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states the code is a benign economic modeling library, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — consistent; no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- Security Risk: 0 — no apparent security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar understanding.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; data flows into class instances, functions, and methods.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external access.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward implementation, with standard exception handling and numpy usage.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code appears clear.\n- Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly above zero, but considering the code is purely computational, this seems marginally high. However, since the code does modify data structures, but only for simulation purposes, this is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score might be slightly inflated but not unreasonable given the data manipulation. Overall, scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard economic model with no malicious features.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — no malware.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward economic modeling library.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a clean, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely computational and modeling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's purpose. Slightly higher scores (like 0.2) are acceptable but could be marginally reduced.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware or malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, primarily due to data manipulation, but no active threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign, well-structured economic modeling library with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
