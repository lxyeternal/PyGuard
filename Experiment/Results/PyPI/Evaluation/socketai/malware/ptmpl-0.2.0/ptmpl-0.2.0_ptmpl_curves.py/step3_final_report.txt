{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks by shifting prices. It serves as a library for economic analysis and demonstrates type annotations and abstract base classes.",
  "sources": "Input data in the form of sequences of dictionaries containing 'price', 'supply', and 'demand' keys; data is read during class instantiation and in shock application methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file I/O; data flows only within class methods and functions, with no external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into class constructors, validation routines, and numerical computations; shock functions modify curve data by shifting prices; equilibrium functions compare supply and demand quantities across the price domain.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; exception classes are straightforward; numpy is used for numerical operations, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clear, domain-specific implementation of economic curves with validation for monotonicity, calculation of equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulation of shocks. It employs numpy arrays for efficiency and type annotations for clarity. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Exception handling enforces data integrity. The logic is transparent and domain-appropriate, with no external system interactions or dynamic code execution. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with a benign modeling library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured economic modeling library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports are accurate and align with the code's behavior.",
