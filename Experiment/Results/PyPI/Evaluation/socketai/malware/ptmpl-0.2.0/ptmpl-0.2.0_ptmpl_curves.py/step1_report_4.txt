{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and applies economic shocks for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for supply and demand curves (list of dicts with 'price' and 'supply'/'demand'), and data within the apply() methods of shock classes.",
  "sinks": "Uses curve data for calculations, returns new curve objects with shifted prices in shock scenarios.",
  "flows": "Input data (source) to curve objects, then to equilibrium calculations, and shock applications that generate new curves.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. The apply() method properly types input curves and applies shifts. No obfuscated code features detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The module provides classes and functions for economic modeling without external data fetching or network operations. It performs validation on input data to ensure monotonicity and valid prices, raising exceptions for invalid data. The equilibrium functions compute prices and ranges based on the supply and demand data, with clear source-to-sink data flow. The shock classes modify curve prices by shifting them horizontally, with appropriate type checks. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code uses standard Python features and libraries, with no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Overall, the code appears solely focused on economic modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward economic modeling library with no malicious or suspicious elements. It validates input data, computes equilibrium, and simulates shocks as intended. No malware or security risks are evident.",
