{
  "purpose": "This module models economic supply and demand curves, calculates equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks.",
  "sources": "Input data in constructors of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve; input parameters for apply() method in HorizPriceShock; data extraction from data dictionaries within class methods.",
  "sinks": "Returns of quantity() methods in SupplyCurve and DemandCurve; apply() method returning new curve objects; __repr__ method in EconShockScenario.",
  "flows": "Input data -> constructors and apply() method -> quantity() calculations -> comparison and return logic for equilibrium and shock application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Exception handling is standard. Usage of numpy is typical for numerical operations. No external network or system interactions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of economic curves and equilibrium calculations, with standard exception handling for curve monotonicity. The use of numpy for array operations is common. The apply() method in HorizPriceShock creates new curve objects by adding shock values to existing prices, which is a normal simulation behavior. No malicious or sabotage code elements such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are present. The overall design appears to be a legitimate modeling library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate economic modeling library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It performs standard calculations and simulations related to supply and demand curves. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
