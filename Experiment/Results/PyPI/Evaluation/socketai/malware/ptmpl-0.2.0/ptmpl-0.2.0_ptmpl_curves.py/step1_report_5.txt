{
  "purpose": "This code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices, and simulates economic shocks. It appears designed as a library for economic analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data for supply and demand curves (data parameter in SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors); data accessed via sorted and indexed arrays.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; no network or external data output functions. No file or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data dictionaries through sorting and array creation, then used in calculations like quantity() and equilibrium price functions. No external or untrusted data modifies the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious string manipulations; all code appears straightforward and well-structured. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs supply and demand curves from input data, enforcing monotonicity constraints, and calculates equilibrium prices and ranges. It includes exception handling for data integrity. The classes for economic shocks modify curves via shifts. No network operations, file I/O, or hidden behaviors are present. The overall structure is consistent with a modeling library, and no suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, well-structured economic modeling library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles input data, performs calculations, and manages exceptions appropriately. There are no network, data exfiltration, or backdoor indicators. Overall security risk is minimal.",
