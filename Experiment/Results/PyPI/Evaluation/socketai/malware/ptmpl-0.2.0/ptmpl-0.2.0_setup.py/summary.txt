  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'download_and_run_script()' during installation poses a security risk, especially if the function downloads and executes untrusted code. While no malicious code is embedded directly, the pattern is suspicious and could be exploited. The scores in reports are generally appropriate; a balanced assessment suggests a malware score of approximately 0.45 and a security risk score of about 0.55, emphasizing the need for careful review of the 'download_and_run_script()' implementation before trusting or deploying this package."
