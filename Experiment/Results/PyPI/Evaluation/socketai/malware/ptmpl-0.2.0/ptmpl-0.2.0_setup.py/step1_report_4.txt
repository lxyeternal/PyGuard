  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, including a custom post-installation script.",
  "sources": "File reading for version info and README; subprocess call in custom install command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes code that imports and runs a function from ptmpl.post_install.",
  "flows": "During installation, the subprocess command imports 'ptmpl.post_install' and executes 'download_and_run_script()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run Python code that imports a module and executes a function; dynamic execution in post-install script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup with 'setuptools'. A custom post-install command runs a subprocess that executes a Python command, which imports 'ptmpl.post_install' and calls 'download_and_run_script()'. This behavior could be malicious if the 'download_and_run_script()' function downloads or executes untrusted code. The code reads version information from a file and includes a standard package configuration. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The subprocess execution is a potential concern, as it can execute arbitrary code if 'download_and_run_script()' is malicious or compromised. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a post-install step that executes an external script via subprocess, which could be malicious if the 'download_and_run_script()' function is compromised or maliciously designed. This behavior warrants caution, as it can download or execute arbitrary code during package installation.",
