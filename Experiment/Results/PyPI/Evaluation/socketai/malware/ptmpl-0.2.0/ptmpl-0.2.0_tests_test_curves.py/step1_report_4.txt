{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the supply and demand curves module, validating functionality such as curve comparison, point evaluation, extrapolation, exception handling, and equilibrium calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data from hardcoded dictionaries and constants, and imports modules and classes for testing.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted or external data; all inputs are hardcoded test values.",
  "flows": "The code uses test functions to create curve objects and call methods, but no data flows from untrusted sources to critical points, nor is there data transmission to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard test suite with no suspicious or unusual code. All data are hardcoded, and there are no obfuscated patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite designed to validate the functionality of supply and demand curves within a Python module. It imports specific classes and functions from a package named 'py_pkg' and performs assertions on their behavior. No user input, network communication, or file I/O beyond test data occurs. The test cases include validation of curve comparisons, interpolation, extrapolation, exception raising for invalid data, and equilibrium calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data theft, or covert channels. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and purpose-driven, with no anomalies suggesting obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious test suite for a supply and demand curves module. It performs validation tasks without any suspicious or harmful behavior. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this review.",
