{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the supply and demand curve classes and related calculations in the py_pkg package.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from the py_pkg.curves module; no external or untrusted data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input; assertions are used for testing internal class behavior.",
  "flows": "The code tests class methods and functions internally; no external data flows or network communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. The code strictly performs unit tests on curve classes and calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite utilizing pytest for verifying behavior of supply and demand curves, including comparison, point evaluation, extrapolation, exception raising, and economic calculations. It does not process external inputs or generate outputs beyond test assertions. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues; the code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign test suite for economic curve classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs typical unit testing tasks with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
