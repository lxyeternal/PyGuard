{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the supply and demand curves module, validating functionality and behaviors of curve classes and related calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include predefined data structures within test functions, such as supply_data and demand_data lists.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted input or perform data leaks. It uses assertions and exceptions for validation, with no external network or system calls.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves supply/demand data structures used to instantiate curve objects, which are then tested through comparisons, calculations, and exception handling. No data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code strictly performs unit tests on the curves and their calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for mathematical and class-based validations of supply and demand curves. It includes tests for curve comparison, point calculations, extrapolation, exception handling for invalid data (e.g., non-monotonic inputs, zero prices), and economic equilibrium calculations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of pytest assertions and exceptions indicates typical testing practices. The data structures are internally defined and do not involve external inputs, minimizing security risks. The overall code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard testing conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for economic supply and demand curves with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly validates curve behaviors and calculations without external data or system interactions.",
