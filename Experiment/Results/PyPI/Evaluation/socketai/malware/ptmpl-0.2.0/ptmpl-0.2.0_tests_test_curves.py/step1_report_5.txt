{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for supply and demand curve classes and related functions in a financial/economic modeling package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'py_pkg.curves' module; test functions and class methods that instantiate curve objects and call their methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling within test functions; no untrusted data handling, no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., supply and demand data) flows into class constructors; method calls retrieve quantities; assertions check for expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard use of exceptions and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs unit testing of curve classes and functions. It verifies curve comparison, interpolation, extrapolation, exception raising for invalid data, and economic calculations such as equilibrium. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident. The data used in tests are hardcoded and typical for test scenarios. No external network or system modifications are present. The code appears to be legitimate test suite code for an economic modeling library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for supply and demand curves with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical validation of curve behaviors, exception handling, and equilibrium calculations. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
