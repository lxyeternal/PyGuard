{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the supply and demand curve modules, validating their functionality and behaviors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and classes such as SupplyCurve, DemandCurve, HorizPriceShock, and Equilibrium, which internally may access data sources or parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs assertions and raises exceptions; no direct untrusted data sinks or external communication appears in this test code.",
  "flows": "The tests create curve objects, manipulate them, and compare results; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly performs standard unit test operations without unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines test classes, and contains test functions that validate curve behaviors, exceptions, and calculations. There are no indications of code injection, malicious data handling, or backdoors. No sensitive data is read or transmitted. All operations are standard testing procedures. The code does not contain obfuscated or dynamically executed code, nor does it interact with external systems. It solely performs local assertions and exception handling to verify correct implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward test suite for supply and demand curve classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any harmful or sabotage-related code. The code is safe and focused on validation.",
