{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for supply and demand curve classes, validating their behaviors, comparisons, and calculations using pytest.",
  "sources": "Internal hardcoded data within test functions, no external data inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external system calls, network interactions, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke class methods and functions with internal data; no external data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no external dependencies or malicious behavior. All data are internal, and tests focus on class validation, exception handling, and calculations. No network, file I/O, or external data processing occurs. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate given its testing nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and should remain as they are. The overall security risk is minimal, consistent with a standard test suite.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
