  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by downloading and executing external scripts without validation, combined with system modifications. This pattern is indicative of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered unsafe for deployment without proper validation measures."
