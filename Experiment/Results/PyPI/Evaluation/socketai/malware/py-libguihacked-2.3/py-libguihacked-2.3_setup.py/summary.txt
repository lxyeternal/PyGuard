  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, involving obfuscated remote payload execution triggered during setup. The package name, author, and embedded URL reinforce malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
