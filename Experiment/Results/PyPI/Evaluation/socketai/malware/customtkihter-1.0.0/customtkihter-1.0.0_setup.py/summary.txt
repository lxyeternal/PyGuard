  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk malicious pattern: decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows. The encrypted payload, hardcoded cryptographic material, and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0.9, securityRisk: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.8) are justified and consistent with this analysis. This package should be considered malicious and avoided."
