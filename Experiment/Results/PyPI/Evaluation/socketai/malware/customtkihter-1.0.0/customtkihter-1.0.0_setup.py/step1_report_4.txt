{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes a custom installation command that executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'os' module, and during the custom install, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', then executes decrypted code using 'exec'. The decrypted code is obtained from a Fernet-encrypted string.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted code is executed with 'exec', which can run arbitrary code. This is a high-risk sink because it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The setup script initializes package parameters. During installation, if on Windows ('nt'), it imports modules, decrypts a payload with Fernet, and executes it with 'exec'. The flow from the source (decryption) to sink (exec) indicates potential malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload intended to be decrypted and executed at install time is suspicious. The encrypted string appears intentionally obscured. The code executes decrypted code during installation only on Windows, which may be an attempt to avoid detection on other OSes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package setup parameters normally but includes a custom install command that, on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code via 'exec'. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution during installation are common indicators of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The code does not show what the decrypted content is, but executing arbitrary decrypted code is a significant security concern. The rest of the code appears typical for a setup script with no other suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior, specifically decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows systems. The use of hardcoded encryption keys and 'exec' with decrypted payloads indicates an attempt to include hidden malicious code, constituting a high security risk.",
