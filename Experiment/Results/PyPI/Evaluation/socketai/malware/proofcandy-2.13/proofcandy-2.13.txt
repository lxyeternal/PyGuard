      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious intent. The high scores assigned are justified given the obfuscation, stealth, and potential for exploitation. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm maliciousness, but current evidence warrants caution."
