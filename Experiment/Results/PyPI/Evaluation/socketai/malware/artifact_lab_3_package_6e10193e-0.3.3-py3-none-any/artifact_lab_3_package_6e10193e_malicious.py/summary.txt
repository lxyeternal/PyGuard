  "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of malicious reverse shell behavior, providing an attacker with remote control over the system. All reports correctly identify this behavior, and their scoring aligns with the severity. The code warrants a malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and an obfuscated score of 0. No further adjustments are necessary."
