{
  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server, potentially for remote control or malicious access.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to external IP and port, socket file descriptor, subprocess call for shell execution.",
  "sinks": "Connecting to an external host, duplicating socket to stdin/out/err, executing shell command.",
  "flows": "Socket connects to remote host -> socket file descriptor duplicated to stdin/out/err -> subprocess executes shell, providing remote control access.",
  "anomalies": "Code creates a reverse shell, connects to an external malicious IP/port, and executes an interactive shell, which is suspicious and typical of malware behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system, socket, and subprocess modules, then defines a function reverse_shell. This function creates a socket connection to a specified external host and port (ngrok tunnel). It then duplicates this socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and finally spawns a shell process. This setup allows remote control over the infected system, effectively creating a backdoor. The behavior is characteristic of malicious software designed to facilitate unauthorized access.",
  "conclusion": "The code clearly implements a reverse shell, a common malware technique for remote control and unauthorized access. The external connection to a suspicious host and port, combined with spawning an interactive shell, indicates malicious intent.",
