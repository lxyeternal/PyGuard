  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by automatically exfiltrating environment variables and containing a reverse shell function capable of remote access. These capabilities pose a high security threat, warranting maximum malware and risk scores. The code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, and immediate security measures are recommended."
