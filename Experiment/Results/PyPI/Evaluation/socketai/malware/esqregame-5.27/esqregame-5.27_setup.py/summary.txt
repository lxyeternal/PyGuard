  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear indicators of malicious intent, including obfuscated payload execution during installation, use of concealment tactics, and suspicious references. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified, and the package should be considered malicious. Further decoding of the payload would likely confirm malicious actions, but current evidence warrants high alert."
