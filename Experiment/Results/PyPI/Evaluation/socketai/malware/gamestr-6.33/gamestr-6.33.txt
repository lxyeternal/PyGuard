      "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell code executed during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation and stealth flags increase suspicion, and the broad exception handling conceals errors. The scores assigned by reports are appropriate; the overall risk is high. The code should be flagged for further analysis and potential removal from distribution channels."
