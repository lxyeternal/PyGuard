{
  "purpose": "This script is intended to set up a Python package named 'hackedmine' with specific metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg', and attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious PowerShell command execution through subprocess.Popen, which could perform malicious activities without user awareness.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory, then if absent, executes a hidden PowerShell command. The setup function defines package details and runs without any direct data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command appears to be obfuscated base64-encoded content, which is often used to conceal malicious payloads. The code executes this command without validation. The package name 'hackedmine' and author info may be intentionally misleading.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils, then attempts to import subprocess and os. It checks for a directory 'tahg' and, if missing, executes a hidden PowerShell command with encoded content, which is suspicious. The setup function proceeds to define package metadata for a package named 'hackedmine' with the author 'EsqueleSquad'. The command execution is done via subprocess.Popen with shell=False and creation flags to hide the window. The obfuscated PowerShell command likely contains malicious activity, such as downloading or executing further malicious payloads. The overall structure suggests the code is attempting to perform covert operations during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that executes during package setup, which is highly suspicious. The package name and author details seem intentionally misleading, and the obfuscation indicates malicious intent. This code likely functions as a malicious supply chain component designed to execute payloads covertly when installed.",
