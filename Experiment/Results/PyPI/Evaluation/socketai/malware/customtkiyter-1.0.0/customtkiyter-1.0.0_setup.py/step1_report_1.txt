{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package named 'customtkiyter' with potentially obfuscated malicious code that executes during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.name; imports requests and fernet; decrypts and executes a piece of code via exec; uses hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code; network requests via requests (although not explicitly used in the code shown), possibly to exfiltrate data or download additional malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a payload with hardcoded key, then executes the payload via exec, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of an encrypted payload and dynamic execution (exec) with a hardcoded key, combined with obfuscated variable names, suggests obfuscation. The code decrypts and runs potentially malicious code during setup. The setup configuration contains a long, nonsensical description and a suspicious 'cmdclass' string not properly formatted (missing quotes, likely a syntax error), indicating obfuscation or tampering. Additionally, 'setup_requires' includes 'fernet' and 'requests' as dependencies, which are used in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with a highly obfuscated class name and payload. During installation on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts an encrypted payload with a hardcoded key and executes it dynamically. This behavior can be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime code execution are classic indicators of malicious intent. The setup configuration also appears suspicious due to malformed or deliberately confusing syntax, which could be an attempt to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by executing decrypted code during installation, which could be malicious. The obfuscation and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should not be used until thoroughly analyzed and verified in a secure environment.",
