{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'customtkiyter' with some embedded malicious code that executes during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'os' module, specifically 'os.name', and imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet'. It also includes embedded encrypted data for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec()', which can run arbitrary code. The 'exec()' function executes potentially malicious code retrieved from a Fernet-encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "The source 'os.name' determines if the platform is Windows; if true, it imports modules, decrypts data, and executes code. The decrypted code is executed via 'exec()', representing a direct source-to-sink flow that executes untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The encrypted payload within 'exec()' is suspicious, as it suggests obfuscated code execution. The code decrypts and executes arbitrary code at install time, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious. The variable and class names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The 'setup' includes a very strange long description and obfuscated class name, likely designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom setup command that, during installation on Windows systems ('os.name' == 'nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet'. It then decrypts an encrypted payload and executes it with 'exec()', which can run arbitrary, potentially malicious code. The encrypted data and the use of 'exec()' are classic indicators of malicious activity or backdoor behavior. The package setup appears normal but contains obfuscated code meant to execute malicious payloads during installation, likely to infect the target system or steal data. The presence of encrypted payloads and the execution of decrypted code indicate malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated malicious code that executes during installation on Windows systems. It decrypts and runs arbitrary code via 'exec()', which is highly suspicious and indicates malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the embedded payload and the execution method reveal malicious intent.",
