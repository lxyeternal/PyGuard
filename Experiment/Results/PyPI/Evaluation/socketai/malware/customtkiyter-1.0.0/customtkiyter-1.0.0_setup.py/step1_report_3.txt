  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'customtkiyter' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes remote code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and within the custom install class, it imports 'os', 'requests', and 'Fernet' from 'fernet'. The 'exec' function executes decrypted code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted string.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code that is fetched from a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on Windows systems during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports necessary modules, decrypts code with Fernet, and executes it via 'exec'. This decrypted code could originate from remote or embedded malicious payload, depending on the ciphertext content.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, which is suspicious as it aims to decrypt and execute code at install time. The decrypted code is not visible, but the pattern suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The setup configuration includes an unusually long and random description. The 'cmdclass' is set with a very long, nonsensical class name, which could be obfuscation or an attempt to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom installation class that overrides the 'run' method. On Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key and executes it via 'exec'. The payload's content is unknown but could be malicious. The use of encrypted payloads with hardcoded keys in setup scripts is a common technique to conceal malicious code. The package metadata and setup configuration appear typical, but the dynamic code execution during install is highly suspicious and a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to execute decrypted code during installation on Windows systems, which is a classic method for embedding malicious payloads. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names suggests malicious intent. This package should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
