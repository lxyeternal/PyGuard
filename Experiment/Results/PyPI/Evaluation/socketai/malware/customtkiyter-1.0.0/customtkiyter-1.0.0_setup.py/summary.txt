  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent, with runtime decryption and execution of obfuscated payloads during setup on Windows. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution pattern are classic indicators of malware. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided until further analysis confirms its payload content."
