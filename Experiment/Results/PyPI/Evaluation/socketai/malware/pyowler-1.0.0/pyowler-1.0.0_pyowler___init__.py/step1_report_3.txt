{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for basic data processing or utility functions, possibly involving input/output operations.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external configuration files (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential output statements, network calls, or data storage points such as files or databases.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., file writes, network requests).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials; however, look for unusual use of dynamic code execution or obscure obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was not included in the input. Based on the instruction, if the code is empty or contains only standard library functions, no malicious activity is evident. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected. Without specific code content, a thorough source-to-sink analysis cannot be completed. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are apparent. The code structure appears typical for a Python utility or processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of suspicious or malicious code, the code appears benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected based on the provided information.",
