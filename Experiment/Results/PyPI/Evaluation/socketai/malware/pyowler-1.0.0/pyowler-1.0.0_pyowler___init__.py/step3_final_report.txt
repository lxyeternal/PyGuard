{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python module, likely performing utility or data processing functions, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables or input data, but no explicit sources are detailed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations indicating malicious intent.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code seems straightforward and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; lack of code limits detection but no indicators found.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or not provided, but based on descriptions, it appears benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned (confidence 0.7, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with a benign assessment. Given the absence of code, suspicion remains low. The potential suspicion in report 2 regarding obfuscation is noted but not confirmed; thus, the malware score remains at 0. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the evidence supports a safe profile.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores are appropriate given the limited information. Unless further code details reveal hidden behaviors, the dependency can be considered safe with minimal risk.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
