{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package module, possibly intended for general use, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, potentially user inputs via functions, and imported modules that may handle external data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, and execution functions that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from environment variables or user inputs through processing functions, possibly reaching network or file output functions, but specific flows are unclear without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual patterns such as dynamic code execution or obscure imports are not present.",
  "analysis": "The code is largely composed of standard Python constructs with typical imports and function definitions. No suspicious API calls, network connections, or data leaks are evident. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The structure and formatting appear standard, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior. Without additional context or a complete code listing, no malicious intent or security issues are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code appears benign and consistent with typical Python modules. However, as the snippet is limited, the confidence remains moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
