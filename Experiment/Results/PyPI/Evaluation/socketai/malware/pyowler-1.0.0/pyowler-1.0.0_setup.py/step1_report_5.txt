  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyowler' package with custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "The encrypted string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' which is decoded and executed; file read for 'README.md'; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "The 'eval(compile(...))' executes dynamically decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Encrypted string decoded via XOR, then compiled and evaluated; this source-to-sink flow is obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated, XOR-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime; no comments or documentation explaining this behavior; the code appears intentionally concealed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a large obfuscated string, decodes it with a XOR cipher using a numeric key, then dynamically executes the resulting code via 'eval(compile(...))'. The decoding process is hidden, which is suspicious. This pattern resembles obfuscation tactics common in malicious code to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the core logic involves executing decoded code, which is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, decoded, and executed code at runtime, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest an attempt to conceal malicious payloads or backdoors. While the setup functions appear normal, the core behavior is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
