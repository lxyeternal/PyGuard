{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'pyowler' and overrides the installation process with a custom command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also reads a hardcoded encrypted string within the InstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile(...)) statement executes the decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted code performs harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The encrypted string is decrypted via XOR with a key, then compiled and executed at runtime during installation, creating a source-to-sink path from the encrypted data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated encrypted string, use of eval() on dynamically decrypted code, custom install command that executes code during setup, and no apparent legitimate reason for such obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines package metadata. The custom InstallCommand overrides the run() method, which decrypts an obfuscated string using XOR with a lengthy numeric key, then executes the decrypted code via eval(compile()). This behavior indicates an intentional attempt to hide malicious or arbitrary code that runs during package installation. The decryption process involves XORing each character with a character from the key, which is a common obfuscation tactic. The use of try-except that suppresses all exceptions further indicates concealment of the code's true nature. Overall, the code is designed to execute hidden code during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, decrypted code executed at install time, which is a common tactic for malicious activities such as backdoors or payload delivery. The use of eval on dynamically decrypted code strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. The package setup appears legitimate on the surface but incorporates malicious obfuscation and dynamic execution mechanisms, making it highly suspicious and dangerous to use.",
