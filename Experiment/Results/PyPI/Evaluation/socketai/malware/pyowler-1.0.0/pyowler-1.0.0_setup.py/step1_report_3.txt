{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines package installation configuration for 'pyowler', including a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'. It also reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) call executes dynamically deobfuscated code, which can be a malicious code execution sink.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the obfuscated string into executable code, then executes it directly via eval(compile()).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, base64-like string and subsequent deobfuscation and execution; the deobfuscation process and eval() are suspicious. The string contents are unreadable but are likely malicious code. The try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command in setup.py to include code that decodes an obfuscated string through XOR with a long numeric key, then executes it dynamically. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are common malicious indicators. The code reads a large, unreadable string, performs a repeating XOR operation to decode it, and executes the resulting code. This pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the presence of this obfuscated eval execution is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code during installation, strongly indicating malicious intent or at least malicious potential. It attempts to hide its true behavior and execute arbitrary code on installation, which is a serious security risk.",
