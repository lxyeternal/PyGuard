Other reports are benign, with scores of 0 malware, 0 obfuscation, and 0.1-0.2 risk. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with the main concern in Report 1. The scores are adjusted to reflect the severity of suspicious constructs while maintaining consistency with the reports' descriptions."
