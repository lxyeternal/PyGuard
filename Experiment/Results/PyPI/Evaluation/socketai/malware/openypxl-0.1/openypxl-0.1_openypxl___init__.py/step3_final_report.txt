  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially unsafe functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources like input or environment variables flow into sinks such as network or file system, possibly via eval/exec or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity, with no eval/exec or obfuscation detected. The suspicious report (Report 2) indicates eval/exec and obfuscation, justifying higher malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Other reports are consistent with benign code, scoring zero for malware and obfuscation, with low security risk (0.2). Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. The overall assessment suggests minimal threat, with only Report 2 raising some suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious indicators. The suspicious report's features justify moderate suspicion, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The overall security risk remains low.",
