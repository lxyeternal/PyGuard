  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior typical of malicious supply chain activity, with obfuscated, hidden execution of a payload during package setup. While definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed without decoding the payload, the suspicious patterns warrant treating this package as potentially malicious. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed behavior and should be considered high, emphasizing caution."
