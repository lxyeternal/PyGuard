  "purpose": "Decode a base64-encoded string and execute the resulting code.",
  "sources": "The base64 string decoded by base64.b64decode and then executed via exec.",
  "sinks": "The exec function executes the decoded code, which could run arbitrary and potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode('...') -> exec(decoded_code)",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily obfuscated with a long base64 string and immediate execution, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other visible input sources or environmental interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the base64 module and performs a base64 decoding of a long string, then immediately executes the decoded code using exec(). This pattern is commonly used to conceal malicious code or payloads. The presence of a large, opaque base64 string suggests intent to hide potentially malicious code. The code does not include any other logic, input handling, or environmental checks, further indicating an obfuscation tactic typical of malicious payloads designed to run arbitrary code when executed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to decode and execute a large, opaque base64 payload, which strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. This pattern is typical for malicious code hiding in open-source dependencies or scripts. The obfuscation and immediate execution without validation or environmental checks are significant security concerns.",
