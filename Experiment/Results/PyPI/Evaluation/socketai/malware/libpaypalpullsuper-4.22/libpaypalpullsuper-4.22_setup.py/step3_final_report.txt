  "purpose": "Detects malicious code execution at the start via obfuscated PowerShell command and external URL.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command; potential network activity from the command.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers execution of obfuscated command; command potentially downloads or executes payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command; suppressed errors with try-except; suspicious URL in comments.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, runs a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command, indicating malicious intent. The setup() call appears standard but is wrapped in try-except, possibly to hide failures. The encoded command suggests obfuscation, likely for malicious payload delivery. The presence of a suspicious URL supports malicious activity. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, with high scores justified by the obfuscation, hidden execution, and external URL. The scores across reports (malware ~0.85-1, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.75-1) are consistent with the observed malicious patterns. No false positives are evident; the assumptions are justified. The overall assessment indicates high malicious potential, with the encoded PowerShell command being the primary indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload conditionally, with external URL references and concealment tactics. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. The package should be considered malicious and flagged for removal or further analysis.",
