  "conclusion": "The script contains a heavily obfuscated, conditionally executed PowerShell command linked to suspicious URL activity, with silent error handling and obfuscation techniques. These indicators strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated as malicious until the payload is decoded and verified. The scores provided are appropriate and reflect high risk and obfuscation levels."
