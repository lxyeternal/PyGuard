  "obfuscated": 1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, complex logic, and system-level operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes. It appears designed to covertly install packages, manipulate files, and interact with system APIs, which could lead to system compromise or unauthorized privilege escalation. The overall malware score should be set to 1, and security risk is extremely high, warranting immediate caution and further investigation."
