Lack of comments and opaque variable names also raise suspicion.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code includes multiple imported modules, some of which are used for network or system operations. There are dynamic execution calls (e.g., eval or exec) that can run untrusted code. Hardcoded strings resembling credentials or tokens are present. Obfuscated sections or unconventional coding patterns suggest attempts to conceal malicious intent. Data flows from potentially untrusted sources to critical sinks via variable assignments and function calls. The presence of environment variable access and network communication functions increases concern for data leakage or command-and-control activity. No explicit malicious payloads such as file damage, data theft, or system damage are directly observed, but the suspicious use of dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets indicate possible malicious behavior.\"),\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code exhibits several suspicious characteristics including dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscated patterns. These features suggest a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor mechanisms. Given the potential for covert data exfiltration or remote command execution, this code should be considered unsafe for use without further detailed analysis.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.7,\n  \"malware\": 0.65,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.75\n}",
