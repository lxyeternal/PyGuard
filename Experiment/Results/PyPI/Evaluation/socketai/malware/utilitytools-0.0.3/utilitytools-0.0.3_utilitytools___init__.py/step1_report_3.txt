{
  "purpose": "This code downloads an executable file from a specified URL and attempts to run it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL string 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' and the 'exe_path' variable 'pics.exe' are sources where data is fetched and written to disk.",
  "sinks": "The 'subprocess.Popen(exe_path)' function executes the downloaded executable, which can lead to system compromise if the executable is malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL source through 'download_file()' to write 'pics.exe' on disk, then from the disk to execution via 'run_exe()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without any validation, checksum, or user confirmation, which is suspicious. The URL points to a raw GitHub content link, suggesting possible distribution of malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads a file from an external URL and executes it directly. There are no checks on the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' to run the executable without any sandboxing or validation poses a significant security risk. The hardcoded URL and filename indicate potential malicious intent, especially since it retrieves and runs an executable without user awareness or safeguards. No obfuscation or code concealment techniques are used, but the behavior itself is typical of malicious distribution methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to maliciously download and execute an external executable without validation, representing high malicious potential. It could be used for malware delivery or remote code execution. The code should be considered unsafe and potentially harmful.",
