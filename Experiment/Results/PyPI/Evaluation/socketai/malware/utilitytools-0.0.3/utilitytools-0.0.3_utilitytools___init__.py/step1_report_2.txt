{
  "purpose": "The script downloads an executable file from a specified URL and executes it on the local system.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' from which the executable is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "The 'subprocess.Popen(exe_path)' command that runs the downloaded executable, executing potentially untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL source to the download_file function, then to the run_exe function, culminating in executing the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation or user confirmation, which is suspicious. No validation of the downloaded content is performed before execution. The filename and URL suggest a potentially malicious or obfuscated intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a function to download a file from a URL, then run it. The download_file function retrieves the content from the specified URL and saves it as 'pics.exe'. The run_exe function attempts to execute this file without verification or sandboxing. The main function specifies a URL pointing to a raw GitHub link ending with 'pics.exe' and proceeds to download and execute it. This pattern is typical of malicious scripts that fetch and run payloads dynamically, especially given the lack of validation, hardcoded URLs, and automatic execution flow. The code does not include any obfuscation or suspicious language features, but its behavior aligns with common malware delivery tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation, which is a highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent. It potentially allows for execution of arbitrary malicious code hosted at the specified URL.",
