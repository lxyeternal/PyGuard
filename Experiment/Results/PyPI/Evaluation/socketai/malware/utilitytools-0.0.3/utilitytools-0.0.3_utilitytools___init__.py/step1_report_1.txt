{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a specified URL and executes it on the system.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' used in download_and_run_exe function as input source.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen(exe_path) call executes the downloaded file, which is an untrusted executable, leading to code execution on the host.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through the download_file function into writing the file to disk, then from the disk path (exe_path) to run_exe via subprocess.Popen, leading to execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an executable from an external source without verification, which is suspicious. The URL points to a potentially malicious executable. No validation, checksum, or signature verification is present. The filename is generic ('pics.exe'), and the code does not handle errors beyond returning booleans.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to fetch an executable from a remote URL and run it directly, which is a common technique used in malware to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads. The lack of validation, the direct execution of downloaded content, and the hardcoded URL indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, but it embodies malicious behavior by automating potentially harmful activity without user consent or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious, automatically downloading and executing a remote executable without validation. It has characteristics typical of malware that may lead to system compromise or unauthorized code execution.",
