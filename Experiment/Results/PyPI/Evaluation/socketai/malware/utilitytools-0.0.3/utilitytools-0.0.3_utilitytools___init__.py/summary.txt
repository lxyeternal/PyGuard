  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent by downloading and executing untrusted remote code without validation. The behavior aligns with malware delivery techniques, and the risk of system compromise is very high. The high malware score (close to 1) and security risk score are justified. The code should be treated as malicious or highly dangerous."
