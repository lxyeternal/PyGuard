{
  "purpose": "The script downloads an executable file from a specified URL and executes it.",
  "sources": "The URL in the main() function ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') which is a network request to download a file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen(exe_path) call, which executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The code downloads the file from the URL, saves it locally, then runs it via subprocess, creating a source-to-sink flow from network download to process execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation, which is suspicious. The URL points to an executable file in a public repository, possibly malicious. No validation or security checks are performed on the downloaded file. The code lacks any user confirmation or sandboxing. No hardcoded credentials, but the behavior itself is risky.",
  "analysis": "The script has a straightforward logic: it downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it. This behavior can be used maliciously to run arbitrary code without user consent. The download and execution are tightly coupled, with no validation or sandboxing. The URL points to a potentially malicious file in a public repo, and executing it can compromise the host system. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscation, but the intent is potentially harmful. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic features are present beyond the dangerous pattern of download-and-run.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a high-risk operation by downloading and executing a remote executable without validation, which is indicative of malicious intent. It resembles typical malware behavior such as remote payload fetching and execution. Given the context and the behavior, it warrants a high-security concern.",
