{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it without validation, potentially malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' used in requests.get(), the open() call writing to 'pics.exe'.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen(exe_path) which executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "URL -> download_file() -> save as 'pics.exe' -> run_exe() -> execute 'pics.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or checksum verification before execution; immediate execution of remote code; hardcoded URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an unvalidated download of an external executable and runs it directly, which is a classic malicious pattern. The process involves fetching the file via requests, saving it locally, and executing it without any checks or user prompts. The URL points to a raw GitHub content, which could host malicious payloads. The code is simple, with no obfuscation, indicating intentional malicious behavior. The absence of validation, combined with automatic execution, significantly elevates the security risk. The high suspicion is justified by the pattern of behavior, which can lead to remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent by downloading and executing untrusted remote code without validation. The behavior aligns with malware delivery techniques, and the risk of system compromise is very high. The high malware score (close to 1) and security risk score are justified. The code should be treated as malicious or highly dangerous.",
