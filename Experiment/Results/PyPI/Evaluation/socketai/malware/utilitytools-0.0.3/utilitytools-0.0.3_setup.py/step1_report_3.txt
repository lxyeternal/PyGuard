  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilitytools' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static metadata (name, version, author, description), package discovery via find_packages(), external dependency 'requests'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup scripts primarily configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. There are no dynamic or malicious code constructs. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling present. The dependencies and metadata are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, containing no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious code.",
