  "review": "Let's analyze the provided setup code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It defines package metadata: name, version, author info, description, dependencies, classifiers.\n- No dynamic code execution, input reading, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The only potentially sensitive info is the author's email, which is typical in package metadata.\n- The code is static and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Reports\n\n**Report 1-5 common points:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No external data sources, no dynamic behavior, no suspicious code patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- All assign a malware score of 0.\n- All assign a security risk score of 0.\n- Confidence is perfect (1) in all reports.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- None detected; all reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is a typical setup script with no suspicious activity. No reason to elevate the risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Checks\n\n- The reports correctly identify that no untrusted data, external code execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n- They do not assume vulnerabilities without evidence.\n- The analysis is sound and justified.\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code is a standard, benign package setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Expert Estimate\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThe code is safe and legitimate.",
