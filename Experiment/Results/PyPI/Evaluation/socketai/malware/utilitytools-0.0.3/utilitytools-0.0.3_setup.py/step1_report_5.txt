  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing setup functions, reading environment variables if any, and package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package setup, no direct untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading package info -> configuring setup parameters -> executing setup, no external data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py used for packaging a Python project. It imports setup utilities, defines static package metadata, and specifies dependencies. No input/output streams, network communication, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
