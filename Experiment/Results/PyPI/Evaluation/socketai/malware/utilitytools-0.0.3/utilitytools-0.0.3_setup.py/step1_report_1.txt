  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'utilitytools'.",
  "sources": "Static data: version, description, author info, and dependencies; no external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines package metadata for distribution. It does not perform any data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All data appears static and benign. The dependencies are standard, with no suspicious URLs or external code execution. The code is typical for Python package setup and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The script appears safe and legitimate.",
