  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup script for a Python package named 'utilitytools'.\n- They consistently find no suspicious activity, no dynamic code, no external data fetching, and no malicious behavior.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are 0 or 0.5, with confidence at 1.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for package distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a simple setup script with static data.\n- **Malicious behavior or backdoors:** None detected.\n- **External data or dynamic behavior:** None.\n- **Secrets or hardcoded credentials:** Only an email address, which is standard metadata.\n- **Obfuscation or unusual patterns:** No, code is clear and standard.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No flaws or mistakes in the reports' reasoning. They are consistent and thorough.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- No issues or assumptions in the reports are questionable.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The only notable point is the email address in the metadata, but that is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard setup script.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the reports' assessments and scores.",
