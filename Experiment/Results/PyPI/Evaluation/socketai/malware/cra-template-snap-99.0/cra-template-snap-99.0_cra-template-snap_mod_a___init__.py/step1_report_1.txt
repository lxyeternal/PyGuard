{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, but without specific comments or context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network requests, file writing, or environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions towards output sinks or external communications, if any are present.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Unusual dynamic imports or eval usage could be suspicious but are not evident here.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, utilizing standard library functions for data processing. No signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification are apparent. The code structure appears normal with no suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated strings, or hidden behavior. Without external context or additional code, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no malicious payloads detected. The overall security risk is low.",
