  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval, exec), obfuscated variables, input/env reads, network or file I/O, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or input lead to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, high obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic execution and obfuscation, which are typical indicators of malicious intent, especially if used to hide payloads or exfiltrate data. The presence of eval/exec combined with obfuscated variables increases suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads (like network exfiltration or file damage) are confirmed, but the suspicious features warrant a higher malware score. Benign code lacks such features and shows straightforward logic. The scores should reflect the degree of suspicion: benign code maintains low malware and obfuscation scores, while suspicious code with eval/exec and obfuscation should have elevated scores.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2's features suggest potential malicious behavior, primarily due to eval/exec and obfuscation. The current malware score of 0.3 underestimates this risk; increasing it to 0.5 better captures the suspicion. Other reports are consistent with benign code. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, with a need to slightly adjust the malware score for Report 2.",
