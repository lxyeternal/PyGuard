{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform extensive system reconnaissance, environment detection, and data exfiltration, including collecting host information, network details, environment variables, and configuration files, then transmitting this data to a remote server. It also silently installs and manages Python packages during setup.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from system files (/etc/resolv.conf, /etc/hosts, /sys/class/net/*/address), environment variables, network interfaces, and configuration files; gathers system info via platform, socket, getpass, os modules; reads hashes for targeted detection.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to remote server and localhost; executes package installation commands and moves files using subprocess with shell=True; reads sensitive files and environment variables; communicates with localhost port 19000.",
  "flows": "Source inputs include system files, environment variables, network interfaces, and user info; data flows into collection functions; then transmitted via HTTP requests to external and localhost servers; package installation commands executed during setup; hashes used to detect specific files/env vars for targeted detection.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded hashes (H_F1-H_F4) to locate specific files and environment variables; silent data collection and transmission without user consent; executes package commands with shell=True; communicates with localhost port 19000; reads sensitive system files; performs environment detection and stealthy reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The code performs targeted system reconnaissance, environment detection, and data exfiltration. It collects host info, network interfaces, environment variables, and configuration files, then transmits this data to a remote server and localhost. It uses static hashes to detect specific files and environment variables, possibly for targeted detection or backdoors. During package setup, it silently installs and moves wheel files, executing commands with shell=True, which poses security risks. The code does not contain explicit malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft beyond info gathering, but its behaviors—covert communication, stealthy data collection, and targeted detection—are characteristic of malicious surveillance tools. The use of static hashes and silent operations during installation increase suspicion. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious potential for covert reconnaissance and data exfiltration, with scores around 0.75-0.85 for malware and security risk, and an obfuscation score of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates behaviors consistent with a malicious surveillance or reconnaissance tool, capable of stealthy data collection, covert communication, and targeted detection via static hashes. While it lacks active malicious payloads like code injection or reverse shells, its covert operations and data exfiltration routines justify high malware and risk scores. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation or removal from supply chains.",
