  "conclusion": "The analyzed code demonstrates behaviors consistent with a malicious surveillance or reconnaissance tool, capable of stealthy data collection, covert communication, and targeted detection via static hashes. While it lacks active malicious payloads like code injection or reverse shells, its covert operations and data exfiltration routines justify high malware and risk scores. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting further investigation or removal from supply chains."
