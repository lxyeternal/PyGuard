  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving eval/exec, environment variables, network connections, hardcoded URLs/credentials, input/output handling.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system access, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or input data flow into potentially malicious actions like network exfiltration or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (scores ~0.8), dynamic execution, hardcoded URLs/credentials, suspicious control flow, inconsistent or suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Suspicious patterns include hardcoded URLs and eval/exec usage. Benign code shows standard data handling without obfuscation or suspicious activity. The scores reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores in reports indicating malicious intent. Slight score adjustments are justified for reports with strong obfuscation and dynamic code features. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the described behaviors, emphasizing the need for further detailed code review for suspicious packages.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that reports 1 and 4 contain indicators of obfuscation and malicious activity, warranting higher malware scores (~0.6-0.8). Reports 2, 3, and 5 are benign with low scores. The overall security risk is elevated mainly due to reports 1 and 4. Further in-depth static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
