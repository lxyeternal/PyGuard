  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \n   The original code is a single function `function_b()` that prints a static message. None of the reports indicate any deviation from this, and all confirm the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   All reports agree that there are no external inputs, no data flows, no network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Based on the code provided, there are no issues to confirm.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of security concerns. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Issues**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign zero to `malware` and `securityRisk`, and the code is trivial, there is no justification for higher scores. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Malware Score**:  \n   All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (`malware`: 0). This is appropriate.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a trivial function with a print statement, no inputs, no external interactions, and no suspicious patterns. All indicators point to a benign, non-malicious snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, and the scoring reflects that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:  \n- Maintain `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
