  "purpose": "Simple function that prints a static message, no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or data flows present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a static message. All reports confirm the absence of inputs, data flows, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and harmless, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
