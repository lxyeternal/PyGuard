  "purpose": "This code defines a simple function that prints a static message, serving as a placeholder or example function.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from no external sources; it contains no data input or external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only performs a print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function executes a static print statement with no external data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function that prints a message. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's lack of complexity and external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
