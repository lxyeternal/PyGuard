  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits minimal malicious activity, with obfuscation and dynamic features raising some suspicion but no concrete evidence of malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, indicating a low overall threat level. Slight adjustments to malware scores in some reports could better reflect the obfuscation levels, but current scores are reasonable. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for obfuscated or dynamic code to confirm benign intent."
