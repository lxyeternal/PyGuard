      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external webhook. The activity is clearly intended for unauthorized data collection, making it highly malicious and dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
