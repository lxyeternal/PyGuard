  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Reading modules: setuptools, socket, requests, discord; reading package info from setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL in SyncWebhook.from_url; sending hostname and IP address via webhook.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code imports modules, retrieves hostname and IP, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: collecting system info (hostname and IP address) and exfiltrating via Discord webhook without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the process occurs during package installation, which is atypical and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when executed, imports certain modules, gathers hostname and IP address, and sends this information to a specified Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating possible data exfiltration. This behavior is triggered during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No other malicious code like data theft, backdoors, or system modification is evident. The purpose seems to be gathering and transmitting system info covertly, likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system info via a Discord webhook during package installation. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential malicious activity. The webhook URL and info collection are suspicious. Overall, this code is malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
