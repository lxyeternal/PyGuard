  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to send system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL sending data with webhook.send()",
  "flows": "hostname/IP data → webhook.send()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import of aiohttp, requests, and discord inside run(); sending system info to an external webhook during install; suspicious webhook URL embedded in code; use of hardcoded URL and system info exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to execute additional code during package installation. It imports modules related to HTTP requests and Discord webhooks. During the run() method, it retrieves the hostname and IP address of the system, then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs without user consent and exfiltrates system data. The webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, indicating possible malicious intent. The code also imports modules like aiohttp, requests, and discord within the run() method, which is unnecessary for a typical install script and could be used to obfuscate malicious activity. Overall, the code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during installation, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious activity by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address via a Discord webhook during package installation. It is likely intended for unauthorized data collection or spying. The embedded webhook URL and data exfiltration behavior are suspicious and malicious.",
