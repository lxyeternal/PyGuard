  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to send system information (hostname and IP address) via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname and IP address; importing libraries such as socket, aiohttp, requests, discord.",
  "sinks": "Sending data through Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, system hostname and IP address are collected and sent via the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends system information to an external Discord webhook during package installation without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates potential malicious or privacy-invading behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by defining a CustomInstallCommand class that, when run, imports network-related libraries and the discord library. It retrieves the system hostname and IP address, then immediately sends this information to a specified Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and there is no user prompt or consent mechanism. The package setup uses this custom command, meaning any installation triggers this data exfiltration. The imported modules such as aiohttp, requests, and discord are standard for HTTP requests and bot interactions, but their presence combined with automatic data transmission during installation is suspicious and suggests privacy violation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information to an external Discord webhook during package installation, which constitutes malicious behavior and privacy invasion. This behavior is malicious because it collects and exfiltrates user system data without consent, and the hardcoded webhook URL indicates potential malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is significant due to data exfiltration at install time.",
