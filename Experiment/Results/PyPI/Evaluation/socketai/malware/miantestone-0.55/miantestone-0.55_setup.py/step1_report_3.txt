  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package to send system hostname and IP address information to a specified Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname and IP address via socket module, importing modules aiohttp, requests, and discord.",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL used to send data to Discord; sending hostname and IP address via webhook.",
  "flows": "Import socket to obtain hostname and IP -> Create webhook object from URL -> Send hostname and IP via webhook during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending system info (hostname and IP address) to a remote webhook upon package installation. The webhook URL appears hardcoded, which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when executed, gathers system hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a specific Discord webhook URL. The data transmission occurs during the installation process, which is unusual for standard setup routines and could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating intentional data exfiltration. The imported modules include requests and discord.py, which are used to send data externally. The presence of these behaviors during package installation raises concerns about user privacy and potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly sends system hostname and IP address information to an external Discord webhook during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior could be used for tracking, data collection, or malicious purposes. The package should be considered risky due to this behavior.",
