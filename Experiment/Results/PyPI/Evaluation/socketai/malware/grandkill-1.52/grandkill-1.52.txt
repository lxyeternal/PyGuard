      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of hidden, encoded commands with silent error handling is indicative of malicious behavior, warranting high security concern. The scores across reports are consistent and justified, reflecting the potential for covert malicious payload execution."
