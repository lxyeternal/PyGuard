      "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload hidden within a legitimate setup script. It executes an obfuscated PowerShell command that downloads and runs external code from a suspicious domain, representing a serious supply chain security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on the observed behavior. This package should be considered compromised or malicious, and its distribution should be halted until further analysis confirms its safety."
