      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including runtime decryption and execution of obfuscated payloads during installation, which poses a severe security risk. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and should be maintained. This package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and avoided until further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms its intent."
