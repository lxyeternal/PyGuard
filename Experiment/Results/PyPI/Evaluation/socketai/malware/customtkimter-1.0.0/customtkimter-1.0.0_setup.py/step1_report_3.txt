{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation command that performs a conditional execution of decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), and dynamically decrypts and executes code via Fernet during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can be malicious if the decrypted content is harmful or malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads environment info, decrypts data with Fernet, and executes it via exec(), allowing decrypted code to run during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large block of obfuscated, base64-like data decrypted at runtime. The exec() call with decrypted code is highly suspicious. Package metadata is obscured with random, nonsensical strings. The custom install class is unusually complex and obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, during installation, checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it via exec(). The use of runtime decryption and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The package metadata (name, author, description) appears obfuscated with random strings, possibly to evade detection or mislead analysis. The presence of 'exec()' with decrypted code is a critical red flag, as it can execute malicious scripts hidden within the encrypted payload. The 'setup_requires' including 'fernet' and 'requests' and the obfuscated code together suggest a possible backdoor or malicious payload delivered during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, which could be used for unauthorized access or malicious activities. The obfuscation and runtime decryption strongly suggest malicious intent.",
