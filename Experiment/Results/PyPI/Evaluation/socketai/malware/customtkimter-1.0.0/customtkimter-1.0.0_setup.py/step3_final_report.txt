{
  "purpose": "The setup script decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it during installation on Windows, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads the encrypted payload and decryption key as hardcoded strings within the class; the OS check and import statements are also sources of input or environment context.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed directly via exec(), which is a sink where untrusted or malicious code can cause harm or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the encrypted payload and key, decrypting the payload with Fernet, then executing the decrypted code via exec() during the install process on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, nonsensical long description strings, hardcoded encryption key and payload, and runtime execution of decrypted code are unusual and suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a runtime decryption of an embedded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, then executes the decrypted code via exec() during installation on Windows. The obfuscation through nonsensical names and encrypted payload indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The use of setup_requires modules ('fernet', 'requests') is consistent with preparing the environment for decryption. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack tactics, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The high confidence in malicious activity is supported by the encrypted payload, obfuscation, and runtime execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including runtime decryption and execution of obfuscated payloads during installation, which poses a severe security risk. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and should be maintained. This package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and avoided until further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms its intent.",
