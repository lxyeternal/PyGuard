{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration, including a custom install command that decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the environment (os.name), hardcoded strings (encryption key and encrypted payload), and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via exec, which may run malicious or obfuscated scripts. Import statements for requests and Fernet are conditional based on environment.",
  "flows": "On Windows systems, the install process decrypts a payload and executes it via exec, potentially running malicious code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and the use of exec on decrypted code are suspicious. The code decrypts and executes an encrypted script during install, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom installation class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a symmetric key, and executes it with exec. The payload's purpose is unclear, and executing decrypted code during installation is a common tactic for malware or malicious backdoors. The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, and the encrypted payload suggests concealment. The package metadata appears normal, but the execution of encrypted code raises security concerns. The code does not validate or verify the decrypted content, nor does it log actions, increasing the risk of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains suspicious behavior: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes encrypted code without transparency, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The code's obfuscation and encrypted payload are typical signs of malicious or sabotage activity.",
