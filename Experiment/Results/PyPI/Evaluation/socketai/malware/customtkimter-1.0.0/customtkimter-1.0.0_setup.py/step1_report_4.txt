  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'customtkimter', configuring installation and dependencies.",
  "sources": "os.name, import requests, import Fernet, exec with decrypted code, setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "exec of decrypted code, dynamic import of requests and Fernet modules, installation process",
  "flows": "os.name check -> conditional import -> exec of decrypted payload during install",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed during installation; use of exec with decrypted code; obfuscated class and variable names; misleading description and long description strings",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated class and variable names. During installation, it conditionally executes a decrypted payload using Fernet, which is suspicious. The encrypted string is decrypted at runtime and executed directly, which could be malicious. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data presents a high security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution. Dependencies like 'fernet' and 'requests' are declared, but the key concern is the dynamic execution of potentially malicious code during package install. No hardcoded credentials are evident outside the encrypted payload. Overall, the script contains suspicious behavior with a high risk of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation, indicating malicious intent. It leverages runtime decryption and dynamic execution, which are common malicious tactics to hide payloads. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data is highly concerning and should be considered malicious. The package poses a significant security risk and should not be used.",
