  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of code content; it appears to be an empty or placeholder file.",
  "sources": "There are no identifiable sources where the code reads input or data, as the code block is empty.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or execution points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, since no code is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present because the code contains no instructions or logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely absent; no unusual code or patterns are observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or missing. Without actual code content, no analysis of sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be performed. This indicates either an empty file or a placeholder without executable or significant code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The file appears to be empty or a placeholder, presenting no security concern.",
