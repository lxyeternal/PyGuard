  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments, environment variables, stdin, external data sources, and code files.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, data leaks, environment variable access, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sensitive operations such as network communication, file handling, or environment variable access.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no suspicious activity, with code described as benign or absent. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated code detected. Risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by handling untrusted inputs but no evidence of malicious intent. The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No significant anomalies or inconsistencies are observed across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are accurate and consistent. Given the descriptions, the code appears benign with negligible security risks. Minor adjustments could be made to risk scores to reflect very low threat levels, but current scores are reasonable.",
