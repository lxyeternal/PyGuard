  "purpose": "The code is intended for data processing, utility functions, or network communication, with input from environment variables, user input, or external files.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input functions, external data sources, or files.",
  "sinks": "Output functions, network sockets, system commands, or file writes, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system commands), potentially through dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), dynamic imports, or unusual variable usage that may hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears benign, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation in most reports. Report 4 notes potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, which raises suspicion but lacks confirmed malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware 0.3, obfuscated 0.7) reflect cautious suspicion. Other reports consistently show benign patterns with low risk and malware scores. The confidence levels align with the evidence, and no significant anomalies are detected. The scores are justified given the potential for obfuscation and dynamic code, but without concrete malicious actions, they remain moderate.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are generally benign, with the main concern being obfuscation and dynamic execution in one report, which justifies cautious scoring. Overall, the supply chain security risk appears low, and the scores are consistent with the observed code behavior.",
