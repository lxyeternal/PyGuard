  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package possibly intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from user input, environment variables, or external files, as indicated by the use of input() functions and environment variable access.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, especially if there are subprocess or socket usage. However, no explicit network or system code is visible in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables into internal variables, possibly leading to sensitive operations or outputs if any external data is not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs such as obfuscated code, eval, exec, or malicious network activity are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from standard input or environment variables, processes data internally, and may write output or perform computations. No suspicious behaviors such as malicious data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or destructive actions are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in isolation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are observed. The structure and content are typical of legitimate utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalous or suspicious constructs detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
