{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or data sources.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from external files or network sources if present in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions like 'print', 'write', or network operations such as 'requests' calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code observed. The code structure appears standard, with no signs of unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code processes data via standard Python constructs, with no indications of malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated sections. The absence of network or system modifications reduces suspicion. Without more context or external interactions, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems to be a typical data processing script with no suspicious features.",
