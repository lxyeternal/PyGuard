  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the reasoning behind each assessment.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom vidstream.streaming import StreamingServer\nfrom vidstream.streaming import CameraClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import VideoClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import ScreenShareClient\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioSender\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioReceiver\n```\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code only imports classes related to streaming and audio functionalities; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is accurate. The code is purely import statements with no executable logic or data handling. No signs of malicious activity. The high confidence score aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that only import statements are present, with no malicious signs.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, this is correct. The code snippet only imports modules/classes, and there's no indication of malicious intent. The confidence is high, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, noting the absence of data sinks, flows, or anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning holds. The minimal code does not suggest malicious activity. The slight reduction in confidence (0.8) is acceptable given the limited context, and the security risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is only import statements, with no further logic. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Only import statements; no malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code snippet does not contain any executable code or data handling, so no malware or security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements.\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or suspicious behavior based solely on these import statements.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the lack of executable or data handling code.\n\n### Final Considerations:\n- Since the code only contains import statements, **the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0**.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Based on the provided code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from import statements alone)\n\n**Additional note:**  \nIf the context included actual code execution, data handling, or network operations, the scores might need reevaluation. But with only import statements, the security concern is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code snippet shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should reflect this, remaining at zero for malware and risk.",
