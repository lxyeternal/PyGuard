  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on import statements, with no executable code, data handling, or network activity shown.\n- The 'malware' scores are all zero, which aligns with the lack of malicious behavior in the snippet.\n- The 'obfuscated' scores are zero, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the limited context.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), which is appropriate for static import analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code only contains import statements; no issues or vulnerabilities are detectable here.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are import statements with no immediate malicious activity.\n   - They appropriately note the absence of data flows, data sinks, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - The 'malware' scores are all zero, which is consistent.\n   - The 'obfuscated' scores are zero, also consistent.\n   - The 'securityRisk' scores are minimal, which is reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the current analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code only imports modules, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No signs of malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The 'malware' scores of zero are justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid speculative claims; they only note the import statements and their typical use.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical points:\n\n- Since the code is only import statements, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks**.\n- The reports correctly identify that without further code, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable in the provided snippet.\n- Import statements alone are not suspicious, especially when they are from a known open-source library.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code snippet appears to be a benign part of a media streaming application setup.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- Continue monitoring if further code reveals actual data handling, network activity, or suspicious behaviors.",
