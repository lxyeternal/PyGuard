  "purpose": "Import statements for classes related to streaming, camera, video, screen sharing, and audio functionalities from the 'vidstream' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements pulling in classes from the 'vidstream' package modules 'streaming' and 'audio'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only imports classes without any data handling or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only class imports are shown, with no instantiation or data passing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected in import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party 'vidstream' package, importing streaming, camera, video, screen sharing, and audio classes. There is no execution, data handling, or untrusted input processing shown. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. Without further code, no malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs import statements from the 'vidstream' library and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. Based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
