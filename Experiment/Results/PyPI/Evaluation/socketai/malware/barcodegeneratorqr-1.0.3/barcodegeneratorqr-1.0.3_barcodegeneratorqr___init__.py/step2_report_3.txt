  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the details of each assessment.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom vidstream.streaming import StreamingServer\nfrom vidstream.streaming import CameraClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import VideoClient\nfrom vidstream.streaming import ScreenShareClient\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioSender\nfrom vidstream.audio import AudioReceiver\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code only contains import statements; no functions, data processing, network activity, or execution.\n- The modules imported are standard for media streaming applications.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are visible.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior in the import statements.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Importing classes for streaming media.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity, just import statements.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues identified.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Importing streaming/audio modules.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly elevated but still very low)\n- **Assessment:** The risk score seems slightly high given the context. Since the code only imports modules, there's no active malicious behavior. The low risk score (0.1) is acceptable, but perhaps could be 0, as no actual risk is demonstrated.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Importing classes for streaming.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above; the risk score could be lowered to 0 due to the absence of executable code or suspicious patterns.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Import statements.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Are the import statements potentially malicious?**  \n  No. Import statements alone are not malicious; they are standard in code setup.\n\n- **Could the modules be used maliciously later?**  \n  Yes, but this cannot be determined from the snippet. Since the reports only analyze the static import statements, and no further code is provided, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the malware scores appropriate?**  \n  All are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.  \n  The risk scores are mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1—this is slightly conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.  \n  The obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  Since the code is only import statements with no executable logic, the risk scores should be 0 or very close to it. The small risk scores (0.1) can be justified as conservative but could be lowered to 0 for clarity.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  No justification exists for scores above 0.5 in malware or risk, given the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Risk Score | Obfuscated | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0            | 0            | Only import statements, no malicious activity. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0            | 0            | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0 or 0.1     | 0            | No active code, only imports; risk is negligible. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0 or 0.1     | 0            | Same as above. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0            | 0            | No issues detected. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\n**Based on the static import statements provided, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be 0.**  \nAny higher scores are unjustified without further context or executable code demonstrating malicious behavior.",
