  "purpose": "Import statements for streaming and audio modules, likely part of a multimedia application.",
  "sources": "Imported modules 'vidstream.streaming' and 'vidstream.audio'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic included; only imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; imports are standard for multimedia streaming functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a library named 'vidstream', including classes for streaming servers and clients, as well as audio senders and receivers. There is no executable code, data processing, or external data handling shown. The imported classes are typical for a streaming application, and no suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred from the import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a multimedia streaming application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the import statements alone. It does not contain any malicious payloads or unusual behaviors. The absence of executable logic limits further security analysis.",
