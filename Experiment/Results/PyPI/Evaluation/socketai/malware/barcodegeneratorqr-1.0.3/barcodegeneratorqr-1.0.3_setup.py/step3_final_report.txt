{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically constructs a URL, downloads a remote script during installation, writes it to 'qrcodegen.py', and executes it immediately, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "String variables used to construct the URL; the HTTP GET request to fetch remote code.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'qrcodegen.py'; executing the downloaded script via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Constructed URL -> HTTP GET request -> Save content to 'qrcodegen.py' -> Execute 'qrcodegen.py' via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL construction through string concatenation; remote code fetch and execution during setup without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an obfuscated URL, performs an HTTP GET request to retrieve a script, writes it to disk, and executes it during installation. This pattern enables remote code execution, posing a severe security risk. The obfuscation indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks, and no validation or checksum is performed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~1.0, security risk ~1.0, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9) are justified given the behavior. The code's actions can lead to system compromise, data theft, or malware infection. All evidence points to malicious activity, and the remote code should be considered untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation. It is highly obfuscated and poses a critical security threat, warranting a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score around 0.9, and security risk of 1.0.",
