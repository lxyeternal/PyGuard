      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious with signs of malicious intent, heavily obfuscated to conceal system modifications, package installations, and potential backdoor activities. Given the extensive obfuscation, system API calls, and dangerous modules involved, it should be classified as malicious with a very high security risk. It warrants immediate removal and further security analysis before any use."

      "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with some suspicion in reports 4 and 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. The overall malware score is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is higher (~0.4), and security risk remains moderate (~0.35). The assessments are justified and consistent with the evidence; minor score adjustments improve accuracy."
