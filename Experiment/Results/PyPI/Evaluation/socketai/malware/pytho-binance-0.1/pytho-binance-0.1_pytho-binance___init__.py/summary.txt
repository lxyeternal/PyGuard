  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with some suspicion in reports 4 and 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. The overall malware score is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is higher (~0.4), and security risk remains moderate (~0.35). The assessments are justified and consistent with the evidence; minor score adjustments improve accuracy."
