  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data flows from sources such as input functions, environment variables, or external data, and code execution points like eval/exec or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data leading to data leaks, remote code execution, or network communication with suspicious domains.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially involving dynamic code execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, indirect data flows, or suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in some reports, indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1, 2, and 3 show no evidence of malicious activity, with scores reflecting low suspicion. Report 4 indicates high obfuscation and moderate malware suspicion, justified by obfuscation and dynamic functions. Report 5 suggests potential secrets and dynamic code, warranting slightly increased malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, scores are consistent with the evidence, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels where applicable.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with some suspicion in reports 4 and 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. The overall malware score is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is higher (~0.4), and security risk remains moderate (~0.35). The assessments are justified and consistent with the evidence; minor score adjustments improve accuracy.",
