{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the oss2 Python library, specifically testing resumable upload features and directory management.",
  "sources": "os module for filesystem checks and modifications; oss2 module for determine_part_size and ResumableStore functionalities.",
  "sinks": "os.path.exists, os.rmdir (filesystem operations), oss2.ResumableStore (filesystem-based storage).",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and directory creation/deletion operations; no external or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests for the oss2 library, verifying directory creation/removal and upload part size calculation. Filesystem operations are contained within test scope and do not involve untrusted input. No code injection, network activity, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing script for a Python SDK, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It performs filesystem checks and operations within a controlled test environment, and the use of the oss2 library appears legitimate.",
