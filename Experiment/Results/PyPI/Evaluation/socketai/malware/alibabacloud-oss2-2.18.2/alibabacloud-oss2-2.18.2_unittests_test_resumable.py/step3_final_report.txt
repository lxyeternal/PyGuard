  "purpose": "Unit tests for oss2 SDK, verifying determine_part_size and ResumableStore directory handling.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks (os.path.exists, os.rmdir), oss2 functions (determine_part_size, ResumableStore)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; filesystem operations are local and controlled",
  "flows": "No external data flows; local filesystem operations within test scope",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward test code with standard library usage",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for the oss2 SDK, involving local filesystem operations and function calls. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code does not contain obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The filesystem manipulations are typical for testing and do not pose security risks. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate, though the risk score could be lowered to 0 given the controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard testing code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. It involves controlled filesystem operations and legitimate library functions. The supply chain security risk is negligible.",
