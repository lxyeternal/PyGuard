{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the oss2 library, specifically testing part size determination and resumable store directory handling.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, os.path.isdir, os.rmdir, oss2.determine_part_size, oss2.ResumableStore",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to security issues; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input from filesystem checks (os.path.exists, os.path.isdir) used to verify directory states; oss2 functions operate on internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. Standard testing practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of the oss2 library's partition size calculation and directory management. It manipulates local filesystem paths, verifying directory creation and removal. No external network calls, no handling of untrusted input, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The use of os and oss2 functions appears standard and safe, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test script that tests internal library functions related to file storage and partitioning. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
