{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the oss2 library, specifically testing resumable upload functionality and directory handling.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (os.path.exists, os.rmdir), imports oss2 module.",
  "sinks": "os.path.exists, os.rmdir — interact with filesystem to check and remove directories.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks and manipulations are straightforward; no untrusted data sources or data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Tests are standard and do not perform any covert operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports oss2, a known cloud storage SDK, and performs unit testing functions. It checks partition size determination logic and directory creation/removal for resumable uploads. Filesystem interactions are local and benign. No malicious payloads, no network activity, no suspicious obfuscated code. The code appears standard and safe, focusing on functional testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for oss2, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
