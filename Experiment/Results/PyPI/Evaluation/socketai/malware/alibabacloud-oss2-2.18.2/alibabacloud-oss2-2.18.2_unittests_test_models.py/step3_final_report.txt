  "purpose": "Unit test for parsing byte range strings in the GetObjectResult class.",
  "sources": "The input string 'bytes 0-128/1024' used in _parse_range_str method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; test uses static input only.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into _parse_range_str, which outputs parsed byte range values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test verifying the correct parsing of a byte range string. It does not handle external data, perform network operations, or contain any malicious or suspicious code. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The test is well-structured, with high confidence in its safety. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly parses a static input without any suspicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
