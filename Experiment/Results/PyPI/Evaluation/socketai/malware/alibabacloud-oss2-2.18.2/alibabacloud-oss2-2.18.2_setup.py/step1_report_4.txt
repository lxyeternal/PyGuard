{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'alibabacloud-oss2' Python SDK, primarily to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'oss2/__init__.py'; reading 'README.rst' file for long description; static package definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script reads local files to gather metadata and passes this data to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures without any suspicious constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, attempts to import 'setuptools', reads version info from a specific file, reads a readme file, and calls 'setup()' with static and dynamically read data. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets, external code execution, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are standard, with no suspicious or malicious packages listed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks safely.",
