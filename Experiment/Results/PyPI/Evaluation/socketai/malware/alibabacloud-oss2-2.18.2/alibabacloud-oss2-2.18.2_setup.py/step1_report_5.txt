{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'alibabacloud-oss2' Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'oss2/__init__.py', reads README.rst for long description, and uses standard setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> sets package parameters -> completes setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script extracts version info via regex from a specific module, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted input, nor does it contain network or system commands. All operations are typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution without handling untrusted inputs or performing harmful actions.",
