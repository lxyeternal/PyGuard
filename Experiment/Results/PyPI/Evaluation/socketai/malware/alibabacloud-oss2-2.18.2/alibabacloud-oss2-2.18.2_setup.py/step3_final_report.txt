  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'alibabacloud-oss2'.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'oss2/__init__.py' via regex; reads 'README.rst' content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and package setup call.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README files, then calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "URL field is empty; no suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks without dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input. The version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The empty URL is likely an oversight but not malicious. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to the missing URL, which is not a security concern.",
