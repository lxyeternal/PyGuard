{
  "purpose": "This code imports a local module named 'common' within a package, likely for initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import common' reads the local module 'common' in the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source (importing 'common') does not lead to any data flow or external interaction; it simply loads a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python import statement used in package initialization. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any commands. The import is local and does not involve external data or code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a benign assessment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward import statement and lack of any suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring accurately reflects the code's harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
