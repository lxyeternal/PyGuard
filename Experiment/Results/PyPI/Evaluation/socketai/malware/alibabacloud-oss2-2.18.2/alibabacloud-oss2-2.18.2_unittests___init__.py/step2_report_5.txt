  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n1. Confirm if the code matches the description:\n   - The code snippet is:\n     ```python\n     # __init__\n     from . import common\n     ```\n   - All reports correctly identify this as a simple import statement within a package, specifically importing a module named 'common' from the current package.\n\n2. Are there any issues or suspicious elements?\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Python package initialization.\n   - No external data sources, no data processing, no command execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. Are the scores appropriate?\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which makes sense given the simplicity.\n\n4. Are there any logical flaws or reasoning errors?\n   - No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the visible code, which is appropriate.\n\n5. Are the scores consistent?\n   - Yes, all reports' scores are consistent with their analysis.\n\n6. Is there any reason to adjust the scores?\n   - No. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n7. Additional considerations:\n   - Since the code only imports a local module and does nothing else, there is no malware risk.\n   - The reports correctly identify the lack of obfuscation or suspicious activity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should be 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard package import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.",
