  "purpose": "Module initialization that imports a common submodule",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'common' from the same package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only an import; no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement within an __init__.py file, which is typical for Python packages. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no potential attack vectors or malicious actions. The code does not include any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Since it is a simple import, it does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
