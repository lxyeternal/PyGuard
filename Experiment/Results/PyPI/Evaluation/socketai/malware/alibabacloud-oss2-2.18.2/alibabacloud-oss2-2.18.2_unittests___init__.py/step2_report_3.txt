  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom . import common\n```\nThis matches the original code provided. The code is minimal and only performs a local module import.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- No external data handling, user input, or network operations are involved.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The import is standard for Python package initialization.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no issues or malicious behaviors present in this code snippet.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Report Reasoning and Scores**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments**  \n- No flawed reasoning or logical errors are apparent.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Score Justification**  \n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no data flow, external interactions, or obfuscation, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The security risk score is correctly 0.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment and Personal Estimate**  \nGiven the information, I concur with the reports' assessments. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My final estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a straightforward package initialization import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
