{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for OSS multipart upload functionalities using oss2, with mocked network requests and static data.",
  "sources": "Mocked request and response strings, random_bytes for upload content, static authorization headers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; all network interactions are mocked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static mock data and generated bytes into request functions; no external untrusted input influences the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond typical test authorization headers, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for OSS SDK features, employing mocks and static data. It does not perform any real network communication or data processing outside of controlled test environments. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The authorization headers are standard for testing purposes, and random bytes are used solely for payload simulation. The structure and content are typical for SDK unit tests, with no external untrusted input or dangerous data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured testing code with no malicious behavior or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
