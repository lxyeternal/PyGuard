  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or computation, but due to the lack of comments or context, the specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external files if present, but no explicit external input sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements or returns, and potentially writes to files or external systems if such code exists beyond the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. Without specific code, the detailed source-to-sink path cannot be precisely identified.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are present in the snippet. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical malicious indicators: no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network calls, and no obfuscated or complex code patterns are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently malicious. Without external context or additional code, no signs of malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious flows or anomalies identified.",
