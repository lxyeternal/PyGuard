  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded strings, environment variables, import patterns, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() or environment variables leading to potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious import patterns, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their conclusions. Report 3 shows suspicious patterns like eval()/exec() and obfuscation, warranting higher concern. The scores align with the described behaviors, with Report 3's malware score of 0.4 being slightly conservative; increasing it to 0.5 could better reflect the potential risk. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Report 3's suspicion is justified, and its scores appropriately reflect potential malicious behavior. Minor score adjustments for Report 3 could be considered, but current scores are acceptable. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate security risks with no confirmed malicious payloads.",
