  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports standard modules and performs basic data processing or system interaction. Specific purpose cannot be definitively identified without further context, but it does not seem inherently malicious.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input, or file data (if present). In the provided code, no explicit sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Writing to system files, executing system commands, or network communication (if present). In the provided code, no explicit sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (if any) to sinks (if any), but no such paths are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing standard modules and performing expected operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious injections, or suspicious data handling are present. The absence of external data reads or network activity suggests low risk. Without additional code or context, the analysis indicates benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe.",
