  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor unconventional listing of standard library modules in 'install_requires' does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to dependency choices but without any malicious intent."
