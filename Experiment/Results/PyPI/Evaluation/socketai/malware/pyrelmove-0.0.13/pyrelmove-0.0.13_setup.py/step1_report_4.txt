{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'pyrelmove' for mouse movement detection, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval calls are present.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into long_description; uses setup() to define package configuration with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The install_requires list includes common packages, but 'zipfile' and 'sqlite3' are standard library modules, which is acceptable but should be noted.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools and reads a markdown file for description. It defines package metadata including name, version, author info, description, and dependencies. The dependencies list includes some standard modules (zipfile, sqlite3) which are included in the Python standard library, but listing them explicitly in 'install_requires' is unconventional. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is well-structured and free from anomalies or malicious code. The inclusion of standard library modules in 'install_requires' is unconventional but not malicious.",
