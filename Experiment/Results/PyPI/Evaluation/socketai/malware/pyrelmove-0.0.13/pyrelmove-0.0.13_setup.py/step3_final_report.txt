  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyrelmove' package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; static metadata fields; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static setup process with dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Listing 'zipfile' and 'sqlite3' in 'install_requires' is unconventional since they are standard library modules, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README.md file for the long description, defines static metadata, and specifies dependencies, mostly common packages. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The inclusion of 'zipfile' and 'sqlite3' in 'install_requires' is unconventional but not malicious. All dependencies are legitimate, and the code structure is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or obfuscation. The dependencies like 'discord_webhook' could be misused elsewhere, but within this script, they are standard dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor unconventional listing of standard library modules in 'install_requires' does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to dependency choices but without any malicious intent.",
