  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pyrelmove' designed for mouse movement detection in Lua games.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; loads package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is being sent or executed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md into long_description; defines package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated parts. Use of standard setup functions and dependencies appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools to package a project. It reads a README file for documentation, specifies package metadata, and lists dependencies. All dependencies are common Python libraries, and there are no dynamic executions or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The overall structure is typical of a Python package setup script with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal package setup file.",
