  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyrelmove' intended for mouse movement detection in gaming or application contexts.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md file for long description; no other input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> uses setup() for package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of common libraries and standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for description, and specifying dependencies such as opencv-python, discord_webhook, browser_cookie3, pyautogui, pyaudio, psutil, zipfile, and sqlite3. All dependencies are legitimate, well-known packages. There are no apparent malicious behaviors like network connections, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code structure and syntax are straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
