  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, using setuptools.\n- It reads a README.md for the long description.\n- Defines static metadata: name, version, author, description.\n- Lists dependencies in `install_requires`, including common packages like opencv-python, discord_webhook, browser_cookie3, pyautogui, pyaudio, psutil, zipfile, sqlite3.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies in code structure.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Issue Review:\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Set up configuration for 'pyrelmove' for mouse movement detection.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; dependencies are common; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Define setup for 'pyrelmove', including metadata and dependencies.\n- **Findings:** Dependencies are typical; 'discord_webhook' could be used maliciously, but nothing in the code indicates misuse.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (possibly due to 'discord_webhook' being potentially misused elsewhere, but not in this code)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, just dependencies.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup for mouse movement detection.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with a benign setup script.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup for 'pyrelmove', with mention of standard libraries 'zipfile' and 'sqlite3'.\n- **Findings:** Listing standard libraries in 'install_requires' is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to unconventional dependency listing)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; just an unusual but benign practice.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup for 'pyrelmove' for mouse detection.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; dependencies are standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of standard library modules ('zipfile', 'sqlite3') in 'install_requires', which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious code and the benign nature of the script, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, mainly reflecting the unconventional listing of standard libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the majority of the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign nature and the lack of suspicious activity in the code.",
