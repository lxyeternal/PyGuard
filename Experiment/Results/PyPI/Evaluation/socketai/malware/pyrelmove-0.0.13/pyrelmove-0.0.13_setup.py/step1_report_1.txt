{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'pyrelmove' that detects mouse movement.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; reading environment variables and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content for description; setting package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. The install_requires list includes common libraries related to image processing, webhooks, cookies, automation, audio, system info, and database interaction. No unusual or suspicious dependencies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for description, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. No code execution, data collection, or network activity is embedded. All dependencies are standard libraries or common packages, with no indication of malicious intent. The structure and format are typical for Python setup scripts, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior, suspicious dependencies, or anomalies. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package distribution purposes.",
