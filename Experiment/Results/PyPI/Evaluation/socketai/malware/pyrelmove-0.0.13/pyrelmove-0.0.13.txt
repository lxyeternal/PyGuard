      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor unconventional listing of standard library modules in 'install_requires' does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to dependency choices but without any malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. Report 3's suspicion is justified, and its scores appropriately reflect potential malicious behavior. Minor score adjustments for Report 3 could be considered, but current scores are acceptable. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate security risks with no confirmed malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, exfiltrating sensitive data to an external server without user consent. The behavior is malicious, persistent, and high risk. The scores in the reports are justified; the malware and security risk should be set to maximum (1), with no obfuscation (0), and high confidence (~0.9)."
