  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, exfiltrating sensitive data to an external server without user consent. The behavior is malicious, persistent, and high risk. The scores in the reports are justified; the malware and security risk should be set to maximum (1), with no obfuscation (0), and high confidence (~0.9)."
