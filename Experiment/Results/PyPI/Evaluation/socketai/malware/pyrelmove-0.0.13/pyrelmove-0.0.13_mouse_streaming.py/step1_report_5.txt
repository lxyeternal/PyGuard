{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox-related cookies from various browser profiles, collect system information (hostname, IP, username), and send this data periodically to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (hostname, IP address, username) and browser cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave for the domain 'roblox.com'.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a Discord webhook URL, including cookies and system info, and writes cache files to disk.",
  "flows": "Collects cookies and system info, formats this data, writes it to a cache file, then sends it to the Discord webhook, repeating every 3 hours.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except blocks without specific exception handling; stores and transmits browser cookies and system info without validation; hardcoded Discord webhook URL; stores cache files in user documents directory; repeatedly sends potentially sensitive data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox cookies from various browsers. It gathers system info and cookies, then sends this data to an external Discord webhook, potentially for malicious purposes such as account hijacking or data theft. The code does not obfuscate its intent, but it performs actions that could compromise user accounts by stealing cookies. No suspicious network connections beyond the webhook, nor malicious system modifications are present. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and periodic data exfiltration are typical of malicious data harvesting scripts. Overall, the code's intent and behavior suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to stealthily collect user cookies and system info and exfiltrate this data to a remote server, indicating malicious intent. It is a cookie-stealing malware component, with no legitimate benign purpose apparent.",
