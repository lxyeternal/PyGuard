{
  "purpose": "The code collects browser cookies related to Roblox login sessions from various browsers and sends the data to a Discord webhook, logging system information.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from browser cookie storage via the browser_cookie3 library; collects system hostname, IP address, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook; writes data to a log file on the local machine.",
  "flows": "Cookies from browsers -> formatted content including IP, hostname, and cookies -> sent to Discord webhook; also logs system info locally.",
  "anomalies": "Repeatedly collects cookies from multiple browsers without user consent; hardcoded Discord webhook URL; stores logs in a fixed path; no user notification or encryption of data; continuous execution every 3 hours, possibly for long-term data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers Roblox session cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers using browser_cookie3. It then constructs a message containing the system's IP, hostname, and cookies, and sends this information to a specified Discord webhook. It also creates a log file in a user directory. The code runs indefinitely, updating every 3 hours, which suggests persistent data collection. Hardcoded webhook and storage paths are security concerns. No encryption or user notification is present, and the script operates stealthily, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration. It collects sensitive cookie data from multiple browsers and transmits it without user consent, indicating potential malicious intent. The code's structure and continuous operation further reinforce malicious profiling or credential harvesting activities.",
