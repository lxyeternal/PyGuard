{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect cookies from various browsers for the Roblox domain, gather system information, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook at regular intervals.",
  "sources": "Reads browser cookies for roblox.com from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave; retrieves system hostname, IP address, and user login information.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a Discord webhook URL, including cookies and system info. Writes data to a local log file before transmission.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser cookies, system info) flow into the content string, which is then sent via the DiscordWebhook. Data from cookies and system info are written to cache file and then transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple browser cookie extraction methods targeting a specific domain, hardcoded Discord webhook URL, continuous data collection every 3 hours without user consent, storage of cookies and system info without encryption, and potential for data exfiltration. No validation or encryption of data before sending.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts cookies for roblox.com from multiple browsers and combines this with system hostname, IP, and username. It constructs detailed reports and periodically uploads this information to an external Discord webhook, which is hardcoded into the script. The continuous loop indicates persistent data exfiltration. The presence of specific cookie extraction from multiple browsers and the consistent sending of system data suggests malicious intent, such as credential theft or privacy invasion. There are no obvious obfuscation techniques or malicious backdoors, but the behavior is suspicious due to data collection and exfiltration without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to harvest user cookies and system information for roblox.com from multiple browsers and exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook every 3 hours. This behavior indicates malicious intent, primarily related to privacy invasion and potential credential theft. The code does not appear obfuscated but performs suspicious data collection and exfiltration activities.",
