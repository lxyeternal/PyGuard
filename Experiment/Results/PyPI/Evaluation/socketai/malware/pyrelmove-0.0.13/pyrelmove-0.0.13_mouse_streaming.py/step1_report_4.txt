{
  "purpose": "The script collects browser cookies related to roblox.com from various browsers and sends the data along with system information to a specified Discord webhook periodically.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, IP address, current user login, and cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers for roblox.com.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via DiscordWebhook to an external Discord webhook URL, including cookies and system info.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies -> formats system info and cookies -> sends data to Discord webhook in a continuous loop every 3 hours.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL; collection of browser cookies without user consent; continuous data exfiltration every 3 hours; storage of logs in a specific directory; no authentication or encryption for data transfer; attempts to access browser cookies across multiple browsers for a specific domain.",
  "analysis": "The code actively collects cookies from multiple browsers related to roblox.com and exfiltrates this data to an external Discord webhook, which could be malicious if done without user consent. The process runs indefinitely, periodically sending system info and cookies, indicating persistent malicious intent. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and collection of potentially sensitive cookies without user knowledge are signs of malicious activity. No obfuscation or anti-analysis techniques are present, but the purpose aligns with data theft. The code's structure and straightforward data collection and exfiltration reinforce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed for malicious data exfiltration, collecting sensitive browser cookies related to roblox.com and sending them to an external server via a Discord webhook. Its persistent execution and collection of user data without consent confirm malicious intent.",
