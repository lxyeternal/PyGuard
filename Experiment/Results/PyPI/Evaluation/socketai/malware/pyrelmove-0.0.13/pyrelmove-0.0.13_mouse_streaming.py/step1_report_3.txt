{
  "purpose": "The code collects browser cookies related to Roblox from various browsers and sends the information via a Discord webhook periodically for logging or potentially malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading cookies from browser stores using browser_cookie3 for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave; retrieving system hostname, IP address, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected cookie data through DiscordWebhook to an external Discord channel; writing logs to local file cache.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser cookies, system info) are collected and formatted into content, then sent via DiscordWebhook. Data is also written to local cache files periodically.",
  "anomalies": "Code continuously exfiltrates Roblox cookies every 3 hours without user consent. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL. No user prompts or safeguards. Uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors. No validation of cookie data. The purpose appears to be secret data theft.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers cookies from multiple browsers for the Roblox domain, potentially containing sensitive session tokens. It then constructs a message with system info and cookies, which is sent to an external Discord webhook. The process runs indefinitely every 3 hours, exfiltrating potentially sensitive data without user awareness. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent or at least a significant security risk. The use of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors, which could hide issues or failures. Overall, the code acts as a stealthy data exfiltration tool targeting Roblox cookies, with no legitimate user-facing functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It secretly collects sensitive browser cookies related to Roblox and exfiltrates them to an external Discord server, with no user permission. The persistent operation and hardcoded webhook suggest malicious intent, making this dangerous and unsuitable for legitimate use.",
