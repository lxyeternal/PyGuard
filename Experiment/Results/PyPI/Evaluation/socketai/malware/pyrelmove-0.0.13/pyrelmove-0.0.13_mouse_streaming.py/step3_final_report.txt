{
  "purpose": "The code collects Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, gathers system info (hostname, IP, username), and exfiltrates this data periodically via a Discord webhook, indicating malicious credential theft and privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 library extracting cookies from chrome, firefox, opera, brave; socket for hostname/IP; os for username.",
  "sinks": "DiscordWebhook URL for data exfiltration; local log file storage.",
  "flows": "Sources (cookies, system info) are formatted into a message and sent to the webhook; data stored temporarily in a log file; operation repeats every 3 hours.",
  "anomalies": "Persistent, unsanctioned data collection; hardcoded webhook; no user notification or encryption; continuous operation; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly harvests cookies from multiple browsers for roblox.com, collects system info, and exfiltrates via a hardcoded Discord webhook every 3 hours. It stores logs locally. No obfuscation is present. The behavior aligns with malicious credential theft and privacy invasion. Exception handling is broad, but this is typical in malicious scripts to prevent crashes. The data is transmitted in plaintext, with no user consent. The activity is persistent and stealthy, indicating high malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9-1, security risk 0.8-1, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this behavior. Given the clear malicious activity, the malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk to 1, with no obfuscation, and high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, exfiltrating sensitive data to an external server without user consent. The behavior is malicious, persistent, and high risk. The scores in the reports are justified; the malware and security risk should be set to maximum (1), with no obfuscation (0), and high confidence (~0.9).",
