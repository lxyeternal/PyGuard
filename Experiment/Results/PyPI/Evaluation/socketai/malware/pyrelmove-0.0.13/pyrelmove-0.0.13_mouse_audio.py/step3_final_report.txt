{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to steal Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, system information, take screenshots, modify Discord files for injection, kill Discord processes, and exfiltrate all gathered data via a webhook, constituting malicious data theft and sabotage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localappdata, appdata), filesystem paths (browser data, Discord directories), leveldb files, database files (Login Data, cookies), network requests to Discord API and external services, and user input via filesystem reads.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, writing files (passwords, cookies, tokens), modifying Discord core files, executing system commands (startfile, process termination), zipping and uploading data, and injecting code into Discord files.",
  "flows": "Data is read from environment variables and filesystem, processed (decrypted passwords, tokens), then sent via network requests or written to files; code injection modifies Discord files; process termination kills Discord processes; all data is eventually exfiltrated through webhook uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, modification of Discord's core files (injection), killing Discord processes, broad data collection (passwords, cookies, tokens), bypassing protections (BetterDiscord), and unencrypted exfiltration. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: extracting sensitive data (passwords, cookies, tokens), injecting code into Discord files, killing Discord processes, and exfiltrating data via a webhook. It also modifies Discord's core files and attempts to bypass protections. These behaviors are characteristic of malware used for data theft, system sabotage, and persistence. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and uses hardcoded URLs for exfiltration. The activities are consistent, deliberate, and malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for data theft, system sabotage, and exfiltration. It exhibits multiple classic malware behaviors with high confidence. The malware score is set to 1, and the security risk is also 1, reflecting the high threat level.",
