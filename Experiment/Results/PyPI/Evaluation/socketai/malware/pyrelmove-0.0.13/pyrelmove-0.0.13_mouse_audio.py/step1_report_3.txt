{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information from the user's system, including stored passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and system details, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook, including taking a screenshot and compressing files for transfer.",
  "sources": "User input and data stored on the local system such as Chrome passwords and cookies, Discord tokens from LevelDB files, environment variables for directories, and system info from ipinfo.io.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to the specified webhook URL with embedded JSON payloads and files, writing to local files, and executing system commands such as killing processes and modifying Discord files and directories.",
  "flows": "Data from local system files (passwords, cookies, tokens, system info) are read from disk, decrypted if necessary, and then sent over network via requests.post to a webhook. Screen captures and zip files are also sent.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Discord webhook URL, modifies Discord installation files to inject code, kills Discord processes, and exfiltrates user credentials, tokens, and other sensitive info without user consent. Creates directories and files in temp and appdata directories. Also attempts to bypass BetterDiscord protections.",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple techniques common in malware: stealing browser credentials and cookies, extracting Discord tokens by parsing LevelDB files, sending collected data over a network to an external server, taking screenshots, and manipulating Discord client files to insert malicious scripts. It also kills Discord processes to disable security or monitoring. The presence of hardcoded webhook, injection of code into Discord files, and comprehensive data exfiltration indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or benign behavior is detected; all actions are consistent with data theft and malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, system info, and more, then exfiltrate this data to an attacker-controlled server via webhook. It also tampering with Discord client files for persistent access or sabotage. Overall, it qualifies as malware with a high security risk level.",
