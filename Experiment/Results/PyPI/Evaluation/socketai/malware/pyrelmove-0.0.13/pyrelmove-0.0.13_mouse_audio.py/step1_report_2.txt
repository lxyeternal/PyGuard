{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal data, then exfiltrating this data via a Discord webhook, along with taking a screenshot and zipping the collected files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, Discord data directories, Chrome local database files (Login Data, Cookies), LevelDB files containing tokens, and network requests to Discord API and IP info services.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data and files to a specified Discord webhook URL, retrieves user info via Discord API, and exfiltrates data including screenshots, token info, passwords, cookies, and system info.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and files -> Extracts tokens/passwords/cookies -> Uses tokens to access Discord API and collect user info -> Sends data and files to webhook -> Captures screenshot -> Compresses files into zip and uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Discord webhook URL; modifies Discord core files to inject code; manipulates Discord-related directories; collects a wide range of user data; includes obfuscated or misleading file handling; performs potential malicious activities like token theft and data exfiltration; attempts to bypass Discord protections; uses broad process termination for Discord processes.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical credential and token stealer designed for malicious purposes. It collects Discord tokens, user info, cookies, passwords from Chrome, and system info. It also injects code into Discord desktop application files to maintain persistence or control. The code takes screenshots, compresses all data, and exfiltrates via a webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhook, code injection into Discord core, and broad data collection strongly suggest malicious intent. No benign or security research purpose is apparent. The code employs obfuscation techniques, such as replacing content in Discord core files and broad process termination. Overall, the script is consistent with malware behavior focused on data theft, privacy invasion, and unauthorized system access.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information, then exfiltrate it via Discord webhook. It injects code into Discord to maintain persistence or compromise the application, takes screenshots, and compresses all data for exfiltration. Its behavior is typical of credential-stealing malware with additional persistence mechanisms and data exfiltration tactics.",
