It checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, likely to download or run malicious payloads, referencing a suspicious domain. The setup function defines package metadata for 'selfmccc' without any security measures or validation. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding malicious failures. The embedded PowerShell command, encoded and hidden within the script, is a significant indicator of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears designed to silently execute external malicious code upon certain conditions, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor.',\n  \"conclusion\": \"This script contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell code intended to execute external commands, likely malicious. It silently suppresses errors, making detection harder, and appears designed for malicious payload delivery. The package setup itself seems legitimate but is used as a vector for executing hidden malicious actions.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.85\n}",
