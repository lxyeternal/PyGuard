  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence warrants high suspicion of malicious intent."
