However, it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation, so the malware likelihood is moderate. The security risk is high due to privacy invasion. The malware score should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious payloads, and the overall threat is primarily privacy-invasive rather than outright malware."
