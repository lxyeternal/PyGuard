  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on its structure.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input functions, or external libraries such as 'requests' or 'os'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., 'requests'), file operations, or subprocess executions which could be exploited if untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from environment variables or user input flows into network functions, subprocess calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code patterns or unusual language features detected. No hidden or suspicious behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations such as environment variable access, user input collection, and network requests. No signs of malicious intent like data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No suspicious flow patterns or anomalies identified. The code's structure and format are standard, and there are no indications of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility script with no signs of malicious intent.",
