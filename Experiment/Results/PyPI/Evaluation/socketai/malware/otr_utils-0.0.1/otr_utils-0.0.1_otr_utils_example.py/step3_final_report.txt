{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, network requests, and environment variable access, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Network request functions, environment variable reads, data handling routines",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, environment variable usage",
  "flows": "Sources (network/env reads) lead to sinks (network transmission, environment variable access)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with typical data flows and no malicious indicators. No obfuscation or secrets are present. Network operations are standard and do not involve sensitive data. The absence of suspicious patterns or malicious code suggests a benign intent. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The security risk is low, and the malware score is set to 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
