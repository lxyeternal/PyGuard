  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, IP, username) and send it via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to an external URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows directly into the payload, which is sent to an external server via requests.post()",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system-specific data to an external server without any validation, user consent, or obvious benign purpose; the target URL appears suspicious and could be used for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, IP address, and username of the user system. These data are bundled into a payload dictionary and sent via HTTP POST to a remote server. The server URL is a non-standard, suspicious domain (oastify.com), which is often used for security testing or malicious purposes. There is no indication of user consent or purpose, and the code does not perform any validation or checks. The direct collection and transmission of system info to an external entity without context strongly suggests malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code injection is present beyond the data exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to collect and transmit system information to an external server, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data theft or reconnaissance. The use of a suspicious URL and lack of user consent indicates potentially malicious behavior.",
