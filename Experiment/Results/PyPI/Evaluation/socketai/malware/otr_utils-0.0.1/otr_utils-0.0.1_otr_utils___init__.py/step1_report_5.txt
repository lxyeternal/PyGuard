  "flows": "Sources (hostname, IP, username) → Payload dictionary → requests.post() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system identification details to an external server without any apparent user consent or validation. The target URL appears suspicious and external.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system info: hostname, IP, and username. It then constructs a payload and posts this data to an external URL. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no explicit malicious commands are present. However, the action of exfiltrating system info to an external server could be used for malicious tracking or data collection without user knowledge, which is suspicious. The URL is obscure and may be part of a command-and-control or data exfiltration setup. There is no evidence of backdoors, code injection, or malware payloads beyond data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing data exfiltration of system information to an external server, which could be malicious or privacy-intrusive. No malicious payloads or malware are explicitly present, but the behavior raises privacy concerns and potential malicious intent, especially given the suspicious target URL.",
