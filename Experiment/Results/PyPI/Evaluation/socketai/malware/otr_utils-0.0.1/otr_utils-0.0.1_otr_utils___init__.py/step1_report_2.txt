{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, IP address, username) and exfiltrates it via HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to an external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) -> Payload dictionary -> requests.post() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code sends potentially sensitive system information to a suspicious external domain without user consent or clear purpose; no authentication or encryption observed.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, IP address, and username, then transmits this data to an external server. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious code techniques are present, but the act of exfiltration to an untrusted domain is concerning and typical of data theft or reconnaissance activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to silently collect and send system information to an external server, which could be malicious depending on context. It does not contain direct malware behavior like system damage, but the data exfiltration pattern indicates a privacy/security risk.",
