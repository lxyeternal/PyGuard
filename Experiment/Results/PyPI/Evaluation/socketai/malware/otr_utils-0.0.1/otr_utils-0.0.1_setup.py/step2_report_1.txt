  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The core code is a standard Python `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It employs `find_packages()` to discover packages dynamically.\n- It specifies `package_data={'*': ['**']}` to include all files in all subdirectories, which is overly broad but not inherently malicious.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or code execution based on untrusted input are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected.\n- The `malware` scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about overly inclusive packaging patterns rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Confirmation:\n- The reported code matches the provided code snippet.\n- No issues such as code injection, malware, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The use of `'**'` in `package_data` is broad but not malicious.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the broad use of `'**'` as potentially including unintended files but do not interpret this as malicious.\n- They do not overstate the risk; the concern is packaging unintended files, not security compromise.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score (~0.1-0.2):** Appropriate, reflecting a minor configuration concern, not a security threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The main concern is the broad inclusion pattern, which could be refined, but this is a packaging best practice concern, not security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to 0.2) — minor, configuration-related concern.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The broad `'**'` pattern in `package_data` is a known issue for over-inclusion but not malicious. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script.\n- No malicious activity or security risks are present.\n- The main concern is overly inclusive packaging, which can be mitigated but does not constitute a security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0; set risk score around 0.1–0.2 for packaging broadness.",
