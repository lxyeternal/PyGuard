  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project named 'otr_utils'.",
  "sources": "Reads package data specifications via 'find_packages()' and package_data configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Uses package discovery and data inclusion configurations to prepare for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "The 'package_data' field uses a wildcard pattern '**', which may include all files in all subdirectories, potentially including unintended files. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' with standard parameters for package distribution. 'find_packages()' dynamically discovers packages; 'package_data' includes all files via '**', which could result in unnecessary or sensitive files being packaged. No signs of code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present. The setup configuration appears typical for Python packaging. No external or untrusted data sources, nor any suspicious logic, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. The use of '**' in 'package_data' is potentially overly inclusive but not malicious.",
