  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging 'otr_utils' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "find_packages() to discover packages; package_data={'*': ['**']} to include all files in subdirectories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no code execution or network calls; no sensitive data hardcoded.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '**' in package_data includes all files, which may unintentionally package sensitive or irrelevant files, but this is a configuration concern, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools. It employs find_packages() for package discovery and sets package_data to include all files via '**'. No malicious code, external data flows, or suspicious behaviors are present. The broad inclusion pattern could lead to packaging unintended files, but it does not constitute security risk or malicious activity. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clear, straightforward code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), acknowledging the broad inclusion pattern but not indicating a security threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with a broad file inclusion pattern that could be refined to avoid packaging unintended files. There is no malicious activity or security vulnerability detected. The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
