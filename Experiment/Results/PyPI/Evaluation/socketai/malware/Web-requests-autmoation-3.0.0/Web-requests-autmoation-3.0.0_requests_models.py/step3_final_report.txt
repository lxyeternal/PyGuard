{
  "purpose": "This code implements core classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding, cookie management, and error handling within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from user parameters (method, url, headers, data, files, json, params, cookies, hooks, auth), environment variables, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Request construction (headers, body, URL), response parsing (content, headers, JSON decoding), and network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through encoding and validation functions, constructing the request object; responses flow from raw network data through decoding and error handling to produce the Response object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code follows standard patterns for an HTTP client library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library. It uses common libraries and patterns, performs URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, and error handling appropriately. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It represents a typical implementation of an HTTP client component, with no signs of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
