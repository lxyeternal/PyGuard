{
  "purpose": "This module implements core classes and methods for constructing, preparing, sending, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URL parsing, headers, cookies, data, files, JSON payloads, and authentication parameters. Data sources are primarily from method parameters and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include HTTP request execution, header setting, cookie handling, URL encoding, and request body preparation. Response content decoding and JSON parsing are also sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided inputs (URL, headers, data, files, cookies, auth, JSON) through request preparation methods, encoding functions, and finally to network transmission. Response flows from network raw data to decoded content and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and clear separation of functionality. No malicious network communication, system modifications, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles request construction, including URL encoding, header validation, body encoding (form data, JSON, multipart), cookie management, and authentication. Response handling includes content decoding, JSON parsing, and error handling. All functions utilize well-established libraries and follow standard protocols without suspicious modifications or hidden functionalities. No code indicates malicious intent or malicious payload delivery. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code is structured, well-documented, and adheres to typical HTTP client behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The reviewed code is a standard, well-implemented part of an HTTP client library, focusing on request and response processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe for use.",
