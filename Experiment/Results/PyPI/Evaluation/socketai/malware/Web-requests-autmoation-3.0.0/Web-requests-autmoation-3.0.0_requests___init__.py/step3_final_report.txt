  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and compatibility checks for the 'requests' library, including SSL fallback configuration and warning management.",
  "sources": "Version variables imported from dependencies, environment detection code, and configuration routines.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network interactions, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Version checks and warnings are internal; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version validation, which can be bypassed if Python runs with optimization flags (-O). No malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency validation, SSL fallback setup, and warning configuration. Assertions are used for version checks, which are common but can be disabled; however, this does not indicate malicious intent. No external data or network activity involving untrusted sources. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, routine setup script for the 'requests' library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The use of assertions is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
