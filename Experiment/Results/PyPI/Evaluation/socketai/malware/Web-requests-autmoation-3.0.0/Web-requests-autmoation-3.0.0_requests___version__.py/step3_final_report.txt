  "purpose": "Static package metadata defining package information such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emoji.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and integer variables; no input, output, or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments with no dynamic or runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and emoji in `__cake__` variable, which are purely decorative and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The ASCII art and emoji are decorative, not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the code's static, metadata-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The decorative elements do not impact security. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
