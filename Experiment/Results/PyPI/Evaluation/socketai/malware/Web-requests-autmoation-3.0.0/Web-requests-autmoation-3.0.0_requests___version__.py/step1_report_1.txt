  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments at the top of the file, including string literals and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; metadata assignment does not involve external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string and constant assignments that provide package metadata. There are no input handling, network operations, or dynamic behaviors present. It appears to be a typical metadata header for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as package metadata. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
