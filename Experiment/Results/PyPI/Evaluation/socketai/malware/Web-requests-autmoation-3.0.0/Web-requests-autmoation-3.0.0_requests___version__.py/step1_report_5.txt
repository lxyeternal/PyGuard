  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package, providing information such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__)",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data or influence system behavior",
  "flows": "The flow is static assignment of metadata variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; all code consists of straightforward attribute assignments",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns string or numeric literals to module-level variables to provide package metadata. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, or security-sensitive operations. All code appears to be standard package metadata definition without any malicious components or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and solely contains package metadata definitions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
