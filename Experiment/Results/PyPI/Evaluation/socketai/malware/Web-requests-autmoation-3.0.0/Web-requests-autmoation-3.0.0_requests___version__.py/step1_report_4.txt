  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains variable assignments with static string and numeric values.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data processing, input/output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; variables are assigned static values with no external data or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of metadata variable assignments without obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the package. It only assigns static strings and numbers to variables that describe the package. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard package metadata, typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves solely to define package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
