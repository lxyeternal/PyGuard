{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for request handling, specifically case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries for internal use.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks, execution, or other effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code primarily manipulates internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden mechanisms, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard dictionary-like classes with methods for case-insensitive key handling and internal lookup behavior. The classes use common Python structures (OrderedDict, dict) and do not include any network, file, or system operations. No data from external sources is processed, and there are no functions or methods that perform unsafe operations or malicious actions. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with typical data structure implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains standard data structure implementations with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe for use within a larger codebase, serving only internal data management functions.",
