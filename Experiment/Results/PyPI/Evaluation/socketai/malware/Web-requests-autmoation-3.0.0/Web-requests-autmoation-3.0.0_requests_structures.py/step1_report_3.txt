  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data in constructors (data, kwargs, name parameter), and keys used in dictionary operations.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary methods (__getitem__, get, __delitem__, update, copy) that process input data and keys.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through dictionary operations, with key normalization in CaseInsensitiveDict.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution, external network access, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard dictionary-like classes with case-insensitive key handling. The use of OrderedDict for internal storage and standard dict methods indicates typical usage. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code's purpose aligns with managing headers or lookup data within a larger, non-malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility classes for managing case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present.",
