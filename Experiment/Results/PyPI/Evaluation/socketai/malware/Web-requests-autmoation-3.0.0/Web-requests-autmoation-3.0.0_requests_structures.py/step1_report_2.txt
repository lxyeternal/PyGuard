  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive dictionary-like data structures for use in HTTP headers and related data handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures via constructors, update methods, and access through __getitem__ and get methods.",
  "sinks": "Accessing data via __getitem__ and get methods, which could be exploited if used with untrusted input, but in this context, they are standard dictionary operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (initialization or updates) flows into the internal store; data is accessed via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; code uses standard data structures and conventional methods. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both classes implement standard dictionary behaviors with some modifications—CaseInsensitiveDict handles keys case-insensitively, while LookupDict adds a 'name' attribute and custom __getitem__ and get methods. The implementation uses well-known Python data structures like OrderedDict and dict, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or external dependencies beyond basic collections and compatibility modules. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. All methods perform typical dictionary operations, and no external data is fetched or transmitted. The code is clean, straightforward, and intended for data handling, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves utility functions within the requests package without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
