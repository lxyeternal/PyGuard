{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Internal dictionary operations such as update, __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, and iteration over internal _store; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within class methods managing internal _store; no external source-to-sink paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Minor bug in copy() method (returns self._store.values()) instead of a proper copy, but this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, benign data structures for internal use. It uses OrderedDict to maintain order and provides case-insensitive key handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The classes serve utility purposes, and their methods operate within expected parameters. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The only minor issue is the copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict, which could be corrected for proper copying, but this does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of internal data structures with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
