{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and imports necessary modules, especially for HTTP requests and data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations with user input; mainly static imports and module aliasing.",
  "flows": "The code sets up environment-specific imports and compatibility variables without processing untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard compatibility patterns and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a compatibility layer managing imports based on environment and Python version. It handles optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson) gracefully, using try-except blocks. There are no data manipulations, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No source-to-sink data flows involve untrusted input, and no anomalous or malicious code segments are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured compatibility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
