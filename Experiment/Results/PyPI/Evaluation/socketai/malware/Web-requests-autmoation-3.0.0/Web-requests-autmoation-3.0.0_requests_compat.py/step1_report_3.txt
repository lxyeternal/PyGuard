{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and import resolution for different Python versions and optional dependencies, primarily to facilitate request handling across environments.",
  "sources": "The data sources include system version info, optional module availability, and standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data can cause harm. No network connections, file writes, or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules based on environment conditions but does not process or execute untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard compatibility techniques, conditional imports, and defines common type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily dedicated to environment detection and module imports, with fallbacks for missing modules. It uses standard practices for backwards compatibility and does not include code execution, data handling, or user input processing. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard, safe compatibility layer for requests and related dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
