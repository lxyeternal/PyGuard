{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, managing imports and environment detection for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, environment version checks, optional dependency imports (chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; purely static imports and environment flags.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets flags and imports modules based on environment conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant definitions of 'str', 'bytes', and 'basestring' are typical for compatibility layers but could be considered minor anomalies; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim for Python 2/3, with conditional imports and version detection. It performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The fallback import patterns and version checks are standard practices. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The minimal risk stems from the fallback import pattern, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security risks. The observed patterns are typical for cross-version support and do not pose security concerns.",
