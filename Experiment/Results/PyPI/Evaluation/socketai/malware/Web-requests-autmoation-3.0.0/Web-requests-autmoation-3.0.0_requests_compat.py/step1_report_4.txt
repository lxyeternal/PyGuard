{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues and sets up environment-specific variables for Python 2 and Python 3 support, along with handling optional dependencies for JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info from sys.version_info; importing optional modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, and various standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code only imports modules and defines variables based on environment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; only static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors present. The code is straightforward and standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with conditional imports to handle character encoding detection and JSON parsing, based on environment availability. It checks Python version and assigns boolean flags accordingly. It imports standard and third-party modules in a safe, static manner. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The code is purely for environment setup and compatibility, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It adheres to standard practices for supporting multiple Python versions and optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is designed solely for compatibility purposes and does not perform any harmful actions.",
