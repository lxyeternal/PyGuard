{
  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility and standard library imports for the requests.compat package, primarily for backward compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'simplejson', 'json', 'collections', 'http', 'io', 'urllib.parse', and 'urllib.request'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and setting compatibility flags, with no untrusted data flow or execution paths involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and solely deals with compatibility and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various standard and third-party libraries with fallbacks for missing modules, sets up compatibility flags, and defines type aliases. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious intent. All imports are from known safe sources, and no data is processed or transmitted. The only potential concern is the conditional import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', which is a common pattern and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard compatibility shim for the requests library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly performs safe imports and sets compatibility flags.",
