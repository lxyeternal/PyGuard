      "conclusion": "The code contains active malicious behaviors, including remote payload download and execution, privilege escalation checks, and system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend setting malware and security risk scores to maximum (1) due to the high threat level. Obfuscation is minimal, so a low score (~0.2) remains appropriate. Overall, this code poses a significant security threat and should be flagged or removed from supply chain contexts."
