{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package with additional code that performs dynamic installation of dependencies and potentially malicious remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, reading version info from files, reading README.md, and fetching remote URLs via requests.",
  "sinks": "Requests to remote URLs, writing files locally, executing shell commands, moving and deleting files, and executing downloaded scripts via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and external URLs flows into remote HTTP requests, which then lead to writing files and executing commands that can run remote content or modify the system.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes: dynamic remote code fetching from IP addresses, executing downloaded files via subprocess, installing dependencies without explicit user consent, and performing file manipulations that could execute malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a typical setup script but then contains a large block of obfuscated-like code conditioned on the operating system being Windows ('nt'). It uses subprocess to run commands, fetches files from specific IP addresses over HTTP, and executes downloaded content. The code downloads files ('connect-CANDC.txt' and 'shoomsha.jpg'), saves them locally, and executes batch scripts which are moved and deleted afterward. It also performs a check on system permissions ('net session') to determine if it has administrative rights, and conditionally fetches and executes further payloads. All these actions are characteristic of potentially malicious behavior, such as remote command execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. The code does not include hardcoded credentials but demonstrates suspicious activity related to remote code fetch and execution, which could be used to compromise the host system.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains significant malicious behaviors, including downloading and executing remote content, system modification, and potential backdoor setup. The actions taken are highly suspicious and align with malicious activity patterns, indicating a high security risk.",
