{
  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, header creation, and cookie jar operations, to facilitate cookie handling in HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Request headers (e.g., 'Host', cookie headers), response message headers (HTTPMessage.msg).",
  "sinks": "CookieJar objects, request headers (via get_cookie_header), and internal cookie storage.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to extract cookies; cookies are stored in CookieJar; cookies are retrieved and formatted into headers for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code manages cookies through well-defined classes and functions, wrapping request and response objects to extract and set cookies. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Thread safety is handled via standard threading locks. The logic is consistent with typical cookie handling utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cookie management utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified by the potential misuse of cookies if misconfigured, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
