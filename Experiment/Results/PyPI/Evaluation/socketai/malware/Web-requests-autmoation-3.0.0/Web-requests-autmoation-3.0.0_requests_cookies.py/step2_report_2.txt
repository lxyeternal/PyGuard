  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring consistency, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages cookies, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, consistent with the code's utility nature)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is standard for cookie management, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The security risk is low, given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent and thorough. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie management functions, extraction, and header generation, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report aligns with the code's purpose. The malware score remains 0, which is justified. The overall assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent, and the malware score is appropriate. No suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management utilities, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion matches the code's functionality. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, well-structured cookie management utility. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** The assigned risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting the utility nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Slightly above zero due to the code's potential misuse in malicious contexts (e.g., cookie theft or session fixation), but overall very low.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — The code is purely utility-based, with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly higher than zero due to potential misuse, but negligible in context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, standard for cookie management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
