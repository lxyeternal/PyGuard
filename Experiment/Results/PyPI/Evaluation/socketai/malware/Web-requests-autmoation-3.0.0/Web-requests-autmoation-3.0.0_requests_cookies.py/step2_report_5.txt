  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their claims, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code provides cookie compatibility utilities, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. It manages cookies securely, serving its purpose without malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is a standard cookie management utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n  - The security risk score of 0.2 is slightly elevated but not unreasonable given the nature of cookie handling—cookies can be misused if misconfigured, but no specific vulnerabilities are indicated.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard, legitimate cookie utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.0\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code appears clean, with standard practices.\n  - The malware score is correctly zero.\n  - Security risk is minimal, and the code's purpose is benign.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, the code is a typical cookie management utility, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The security risk score is slightly elevated but justified, considering cookie handling can be misused if misconfigured.\n  - No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate cookie utility, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n  - The security risk score is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code provides cookie utilities with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n  - The security risk score remains consistent.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Scores**: All reports correctly assign a 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores**: All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, standard code.\n- **Security Risk Scores**: Slightly elevated at 0.2 in most reports, justified by the fact that cookie handling, if misused, can lead to session fixation, hijacking, or other security issues. Given the code's nature, these scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 (standard for cookie management code, considering potential misuse)\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified in their scoring. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code appears to be a standard, well-implemented cookie utility.",
