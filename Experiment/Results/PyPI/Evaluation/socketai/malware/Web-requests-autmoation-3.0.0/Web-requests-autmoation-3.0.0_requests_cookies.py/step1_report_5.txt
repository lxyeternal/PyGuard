{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including creating, extracting, and managing cookies in various formats.",
  "sources": "Reads include URL parsing (`urlparse`), request objects (`request` parameter in functions), response headers (`response._original_response.msg`), and environment variables in time functions. Data is also read from cookie objects (`cookie.name`, `cookie.value`, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Cookies are set, retrieved, and removed through methods like `set_cookie`, `remove_cookie_by_name`, and `set`. Cookie headers are generated and added to requests via `get_cookie_header`. Cookies are extracted from responses into jars.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into jars, cookies are retrieved or set from/to jars, and cookie headers are constructed for requests. Cookie objects are created from dicts or `Morsel` objects, then added to jars. Cookie removal involves matching domain/path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Functions handle cookie data responsibly; no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious string manipulations, or dynamic code execution observed. The code appears standard for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functionality compatible with `cookielib`. It converts `Morsel` objects into cookies, extracts cookies from response headers, and provides dictionary-like access to cookies. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident. The functions operate with proper parameter handling, and all data flows are typical for cookie handling in HTTP sessions. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code relies on existing libraries for security and does not perform any unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code or transmitting sensitive data without encryption. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides legitimate cookie management utilities for the requests library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It handles cookies responsibly and securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe for production use.",
