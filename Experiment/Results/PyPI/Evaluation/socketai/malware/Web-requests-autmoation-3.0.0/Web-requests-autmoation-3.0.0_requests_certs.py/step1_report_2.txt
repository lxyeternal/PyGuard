{
  "purpose": "To return and print the default CA certificate bundle location used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The print() statement outputs the CA bundle location, which is a potential data exposure point if the path is sensitive.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' and prints the path to the default CA bundle. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation or network activity. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior. It primarily serves to display the CA bundle location, possibly for diagnostic or packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for informational use. It merely reports the location of the default CA certificates used by the 'certifi' package without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
