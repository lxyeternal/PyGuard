{
  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, based on certifi.",
  "sources": "Import from certifi package, specifically the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print(). No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code simply retrieves and prints the path to the CA bundle.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. The script then prints this path when executed as the main module. The code is straightforward and standard for handling CA certificates; no user input, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious logic are present. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that retrieves and displays the default CA bundle path using the certifi package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
