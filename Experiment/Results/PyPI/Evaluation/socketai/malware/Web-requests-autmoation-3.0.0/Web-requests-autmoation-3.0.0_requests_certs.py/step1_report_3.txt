{
  "purpose": "Provide the default CA bundle location used by requests for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package via the import 'where' function and from the __main__ block that prints the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path to standard output; this is not a sink for untrusted data but an intended output.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, then calls and prints it in the main block; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for certifi usage.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple utility that outputs the default CA bundle path from certifi. It does not process untrusted data or perform any network or file operations beyond returning the path. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is clean, minimal, and serves a clear purpose aligned with its documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to print the certifi CA bundle path. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
