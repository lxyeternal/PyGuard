{
  "purpose": "The code returns the default CA certificate bundle location used by the 'certifi' package, primarily for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package and calls it in the main block to output the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output (via print) could potentially be captured or redirected, but there are no direct data sinks leading to network or file operations within the code.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'where' function imported from 'certifi', called in the main block, and its result is printed; there are no external data flows or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple utility that outputs the path to the default CA bundle provided by 'certifi'. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or include any malicious logic. Its sole function is to print a static value obtained from an external library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent. It serves a legitimate purpose of displaying the CA bundle location and contains no security risks or malware indicators.",
