  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle location provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi's where()) flows directly to the output via print(), with no external input affecting the flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a simple, straightforward function without any unusual constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from certifi to determine the CA bundle path and prints it. It contains only standard library usage and a simple print statement. No user input, no network activity, no data manipulation, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The script appears to be for informational purposes only, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to output the CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
