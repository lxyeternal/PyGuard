  "purpose": "Display the default CA certificate bundle path used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import from certifi module (where).",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the path; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Source (imported path) to output (print).",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value when executed. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or manipulate data. The purpose is purely informational, to show the CA bundle path. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a trusted library confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the CA bundle from 'certifi'. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
