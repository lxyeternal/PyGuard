{
  "purpose": "This module defines a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, imports exceptions, and accesses attributes of response and request objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input leading to critical operations or outputs; the code mainly defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compat module, then defines multiple custom exception classes for various HTTP and request errors. These classes have standard constructors and inherit appropriately. No untrusted data handling, network communication, or obfuscated code is present. There are no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for a HTTP request library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions for handling HTTP request errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard library code with no evident security issues.",
