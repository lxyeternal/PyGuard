{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, including connection issues, JSON errors, timeouts, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility module; class initializations; attribute checks on response objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive attributes such as 'response' and 'request' stored in exception instances; inheritance from built-in exceptions; custom exception messages.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during HTTP request handling; error information is encapsulated in exception objects with references to response/request data; no direct data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or malicious side-effects observed. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for the requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and third-party exceptions. No code executes external commands, network connections, or handles untrusted input in a way that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The structure and purpose align with typical error handling modules. Overall, the code appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, and the purpose is purely to handle errors and warnings during HTTP requests.",
