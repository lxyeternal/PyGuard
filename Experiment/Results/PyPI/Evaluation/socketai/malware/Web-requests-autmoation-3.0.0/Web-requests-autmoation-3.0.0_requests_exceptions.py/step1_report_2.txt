  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes related to request handling errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (urllib3.exceptions, .compat.JSONDecodeError) and class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated or raised during error handling but no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes with inheritance and minimal logic. Imports are standard, and class constructors are straightforward. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are present. The purpose appears to be standard error handling for a request library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply establishes error types for the Requests library.",
