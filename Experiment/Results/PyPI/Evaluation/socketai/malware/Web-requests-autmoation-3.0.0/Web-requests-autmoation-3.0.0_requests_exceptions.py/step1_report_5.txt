{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, providing structured error handling for various HTTP and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes; it does not include data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and inheritance hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compat module, then defines a series of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions and each other. The class hierarchy appears standard for error handling, with no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external data processing. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is consistent with typical Python exception definitions, and no signs of backdoors or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling within the Requests library. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks evident. The code appears legitimate, purpose-specific, and safe.",
