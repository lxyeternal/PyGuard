{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of exception classes for handling errors in the requests library, including network errors, JSON decoding issues, and warnings.",
  "sources": "External modules: urllib3.exceptions, .compat; attributes like response and request within constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Constructors set attributes based on input parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with constructors primarily assigning attributes. No network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. Imports are from known modules, and the class hierarchy is typical for error handling. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for exception handling in the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, straightforward, and does not contain any indicators of supply chain compromise.",
