  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for the requests library.\n- No untrusted data handling, external commands, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code relies on standard imports and straightforward class definitions.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is clear: error handling for network operations.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Given the straightforward nature of the code, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0 or 0, consistent with the clear, standard class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is reasonable since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No report suggests any malicious or suspicious behavior that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n- The code is standard and safe, with no hidden or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, benign set of exception class definitions for the requests library, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** The code is clean, well-structured, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.",
