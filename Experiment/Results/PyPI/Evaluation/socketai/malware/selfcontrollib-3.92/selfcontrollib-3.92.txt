      "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, including obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently with potential payload delivery. The setup process appears legitimate but is overshadowed by embedded malicious behavior. The high obfuscation and hidden execution justify high malware and risk scores. This package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, and further investigation or sandbox testing is recommended."
