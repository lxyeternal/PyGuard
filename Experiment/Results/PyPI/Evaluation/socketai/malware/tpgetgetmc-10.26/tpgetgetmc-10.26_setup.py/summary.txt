  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The package contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, primarily due to the obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup. The scores are consistent with the suspicious nature of the code. It should be treated as malicious until further payload decoding confirms its intent."
