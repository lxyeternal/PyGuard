{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'tpgetgetmc' with an apparent benign description; however, it includes hidden behavior.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call that executes encoded PowerShell commands, and the existence check for 'tahg' directory.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess invocation potentially executes encoded commands that could perform malicious actions if decoded and run.",
  "flows": "The script checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, it executes a hidden PowerShell encoded command via subprocess, then proceeds to package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently, possibly indicating obfuscation. The code to run this command is embedded within a try-except block, suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils' for package setup. It attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. If a directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64. The purpose of this command is unclear but suspicious, as encoded commands often hide malicious payloads. The setup function appears normal, defining package metadata, but the initial code poses a significant security concern due to the obfuscated PowerShell command execution. The error handling suppresses any errors, preventing detection of failures. This pattern is common in malicious supply chain attacks to include backdoors or perform unauthorized actions during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell execution triggered during setup if a specific directory is missing. The package setup code itself appears standard, but the embedded encoded command raises high suspicion of malicious activity. Due to the obfuscation and hidden nature of the payload, this code should be considered malicious pending further analysis of the decoded PowerShell command.",
