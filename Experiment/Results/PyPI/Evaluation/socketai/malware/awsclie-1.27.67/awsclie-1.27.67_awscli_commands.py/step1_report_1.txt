  "purpose": "Define an interface for CLI command objects in a larger AWS-related Python application.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, property decorators, docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing, I/O, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are abstract or placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only interface definitions with no actual data handling or external calls; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract base class for CLI commands with properties and methods that are intended to be overridden by subclasses. It includes property decorators, method stubs, and docstrings explaining their expected behavior. There are no inputs being processed, no external calls, no data handling, or potentially malicious logic. The code appears to be a standard template for CLI command interface, without any indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward interface definition for CLI commands with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is unlikely to be malicious or insecure.",
