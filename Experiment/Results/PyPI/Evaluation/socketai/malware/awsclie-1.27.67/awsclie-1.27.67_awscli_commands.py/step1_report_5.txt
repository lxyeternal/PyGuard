  "purpose": "Defines an interface for CLI commands in a Python application, specifically for AWS CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Class definition and property methods within the CLICommand class.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external data handling is implemented.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; the code defines method signatures and properties without executing data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is purely structural, providing an interface.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an abstract base class for CLI commands, with properties and methods meant to be implemented by subclasses. It does not perform any data processing, external input handling, or system calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security risks. The structure appears typical for an interface design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition for CLI commands with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply defines a contract for subclasses to implement specific behaviors.",
