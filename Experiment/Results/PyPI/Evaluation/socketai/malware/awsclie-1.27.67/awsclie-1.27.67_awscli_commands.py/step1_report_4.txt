{
  "purpose": "Defines an interface class for CLI commands in a Python application, likely for AWS CLI.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; class properties and methods are defined for subclass implementations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; no untrusted data handling or external calls are made.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition with abstract methods; no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class with properties and methods intended for subclassing, serving as an interface for CLI commands. No data input/output, network, or system modification occurs here. The class does not execute or invoke external commands. It primarily sets structure and expectations for subclasses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, secret code, or potential exploits.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition for CLI commands with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger framework or tool, and on its own, it poses no threat.",
