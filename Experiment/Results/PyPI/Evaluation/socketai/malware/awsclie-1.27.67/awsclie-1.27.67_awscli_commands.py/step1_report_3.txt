  "purpose": "Define an interface for CLI command classes in a Python SDK, likely for AWS CLI extensions or plugins.",
  "sources": "None. The code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not write data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The class is purely an interface with abstract methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for CLI commands, with properties and methods to be implemented by subclasses. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external communications. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code structure is consistent with a standard plugin or extension interface for CLI commands.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface class with no malicious behaviors or security risks. It serves as a blueprint for CLI command implementations without executing any logic itself. No signs of malware or security concerns are evident.",
