  "purpose": "Compatibility functions, platform detection, system info retrieval, input/output management, and signal handling for cross-platform Python applications.",
  "sources": "System files (e.g., /etc/lsb-release, /etc/.installed), environment variables, user input via raw_input or input functions.",
  "sinks": "stdout buffer, system files, subprocess calls, signal handling, shell command execution (with shell=True).",
  "flows": "Reading system files and environment info into variables; user prompts and input; shell command arguments into subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cross-platform compatibility utilities, system detection (Linux distribution info), input/output stream management, and signal handling. It uses well-known libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of shell=True in subprocess invocation is typical for such utilities but should be noted; however, it does not indicate malicious activity. The code is well-structured, with error handling and platform-specific branches, all consistent with legitimate system utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cross-platform environment detection and I/O management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified and appropriate.",
