{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for platform-specific behavior, input/output handling, environment detection, and system information gathering, primarily used in CLI tools or SDKs.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, platform information, system files (like /etc/lsb-release, /etc/.installed), and user input (via raw_input or input).",
  "sinks": "It writes to stdout, stderr, and file streams; uses subprocess-like behavior via shlex and platform-specific quoting; and reads system files for distribution info.",
  "flows": "User input prompts to stdout; system file content to internal variables; system info (platform, distribution) to variables used for environment detection; environment info used for decision-making in system configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code includes standard system and environment detection functions. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code detected. The functions are typical for cross-platform CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code contains platform-specific input/output handling, environment detection, and system info gathering functions. It uses standard libraries, handles errors gracefully, and avoids any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not include any network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is system information parsing, which is typical for system-aware CLI tools. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module intended for cross-platform compatibility and environment detection. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The overall security risk is very low.",
