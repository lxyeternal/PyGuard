  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for supply chain or code injection attacks if plugin paths are untrusted. Proper validation or whitelisting of plugin sources would mitigate this risk. Overall, the code itself is benign, with a moderate security risk depending on input trustworthiness."
