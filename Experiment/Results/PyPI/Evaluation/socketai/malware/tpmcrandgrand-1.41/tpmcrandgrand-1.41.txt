      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious intent. The use of encoding, silent execution, and error suppression are red flags. The scores assigned are appropriate given the evidence. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious behavior. Until then, the code should be treated as potentially malicious and handled with caution."
