      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicative of potential malicious behavior. The silent error handling and concealment tactics further heighten concern. While the payload's exact nature remains unknown, the pattern warrants treating this package as highly suspicious or malicious until further analysis is performed."
