  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The setup code appears benign, but the embedded payload's obfuscation and stealth tactics justify high malware and risk scores. Decoding the PowerShell command would provide further clarity, but current evidence warrants treating this package as potentially malicious."
