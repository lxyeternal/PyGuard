  "purpose": "The code primarily sets up a Python package named 'urllib3' and then executes a hidden, potentially malicious network communication routine.",

    "File reading for version extraction from 'urllib3/__init__.py'",
    "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files",

  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of a concealed network communication routine involving obfuscated IP and port",
    "Encoding system info (current directory, username, hostname) and sending it over a network",
    "Use of XOR encryption with arbitrary key for data obfuscation",
    "Hardcoded IP address and port for a connection (decoded from base64 and hex)",
    "Use of exception handling with a broad except clause that suppresses all errors and outputs no alerts"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard package setup code, which appears benign. However, in the latter part, it attempts to gather system information (current directory, username, hostname), encode it with XOR, and then send it via an HTTP-like request to a specific IP address decoded from base64. The code uses obfuscation techniques (XOR, base64) to hide its intent. The network communication could be used for exfiltration of system info, command and control, or malicious activity. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, making detection harder. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior in its network activity and data exfiltration tactics.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains suspicious network activity designed to covertly transmit system information to a remote server, indicating malicious intent. The setup code is benign, but the latter routine is a clear anomaly with potential data leakage or command and control purposes. It should be treated as malicious and avoided.",
