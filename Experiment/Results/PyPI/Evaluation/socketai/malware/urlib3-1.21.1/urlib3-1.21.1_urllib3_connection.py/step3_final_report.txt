{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom HTTP and HTTPS connection classes with SSL verification, hostname matching, and compatibility handling across Python versions, aimed at establishing secure network connections.",
  "sources": "Socket creation, SSL wrapping functions, hostname verification routines, and error handling pathways.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows primarily through socket connections and SSL context wrapping, but no malicious data or payloads are present.",
  "flows": "Source inputs include hostnames, SSL context parameters, and socket options; these flow through connection establishment, SSL wrapping, and hostname verification functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a robust, compatible implementation of HTTP/HTTPS connections with SSL verification, hostname matching, and error handling. It avoids suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The SSL context creation and hostname verification follow best practices, and no malicious or maliciously intended code is present. The code's structure and logic are clear and standard, with no anomalies or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of network connection classes with SSL verification, exhibiting no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores are justified and accurate, indicating low security risk and no malware presence.",
