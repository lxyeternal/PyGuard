  "sources": "uuid4().hex for boundary, data from RequestField objects, input fields (dict or list of tuples).",
  "sinks": "render_headers() outputs, data writes to BytesIO stream.",
  "flows": "choose_boundary() generates boundary -> iter_field_objects() yields RequestField objects -> encode_multipart_formdata() writes headers and data to stream.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4().hex for boundary is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard multipart/form-data encoding. Boundary generation via uuid4().hex is common and safe. Functions handle input fields in a predictable manner, supporting dicts and lists. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The data flow is straightforward: boundary is generated, headers are rendered, data is written to a BytesIO stream, and the final content and content type are returned. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The code's purpose is clear, and implementation aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for multipart/form-data encoding with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
