  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides multipart/form-data encoding utilities, uses uuid4().hex for boundary, no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, standard, and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on safe data handling and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns; standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — a slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) for minor concerns, but overall low.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard multipart encoding, boundary via uuid4().\n- **Assessment:** No external system calls or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly deprecated function but no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns; boundary generation is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for encoding; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk, perhaps due to the potential misuse of data encoding in malicious contexts, but no actual malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard, well-understood multipart/form-data encoding functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are very low (0 or 0.1–0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Boundary Generation:** Using uuid4().hex is standard and safe.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the potential for misuse if exploited, but not inherently risky.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard multipart/form-data utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and justified.",
