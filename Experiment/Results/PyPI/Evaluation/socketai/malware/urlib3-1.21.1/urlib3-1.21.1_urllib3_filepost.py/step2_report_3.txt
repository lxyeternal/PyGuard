  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard multipart/form-data encoder, using uuid4().hex for boundary generation, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of uuid4() for boundary generation is common and considered safe.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on standard libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard utility for multipart encoding.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, standard multipart encoding utility.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, possibly considering boundary generation or data handling as minor risk, but no concrete vulnerability.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Consistent, no concerns.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate, describes the code as standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, notes the deprecated function but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly less, perhaps due to deprecated function)\n- **Verdict:** No issues, the deprecation does not imply maliciousness.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate, describes the code as benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, perhaps considering the potential for misuse if untrusted data is crafted maliciously, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Boundary Generation:** Using uuid4().hex is standard and safe for multipart boundaries.\n- **Potential Risks:** No evident vulnerabilities, no code injection, no external system calls, no data exfiltration.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The **malware** score should remain at 0; no evidence supports malicious activity.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with minor concerns about boundary generation, but generally safe)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of multipart/form-data encoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly assess its benign nature.",
