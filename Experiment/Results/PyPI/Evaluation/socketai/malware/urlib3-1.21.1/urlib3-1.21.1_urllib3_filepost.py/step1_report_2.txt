  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling multipart/form-data encoding and iterating over form fields in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'fields' parameter passed to encode_multipart_formdata, and internal calls to iter_field_objects, which process these fields.",
  "sinks": "Writes to BytesIO object, which is an in-memory buffer, and the 'body.write' operations, which handle field headers and data.",
  "flows": "Data originates from 'fields' input, processed by iter_field_objects, then written to 'body' via writer and direct write calls, culminating in returning the assembled body and content type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of uuid4 for boundary generation is standard. No external network access, code injection, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to generate multipart/form-data bodies for HTTP requests. It processes input fields, converting them into proper multipart segments with headers. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code uses standard libraries and methods for data encoding. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for multipart/form-data encoding with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected functions safely within its scope.",
