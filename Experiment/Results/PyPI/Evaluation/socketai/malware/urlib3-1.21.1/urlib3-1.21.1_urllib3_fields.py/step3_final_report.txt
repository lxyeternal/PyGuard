  "purpose": "Utility functions for MIME type guessing, header formatting, and request field handling, facilitating HTTP request construction.",
  "sources": "Filename inputs for MIME type guessing; header values and parameters; data and filename in request fields.",
  "sinks": "Header formatting functions that encode header parameters; request field headers that may include untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Filename influences MIME type; header values flow through encoding functions; request data and headers are assembled for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of standard RFC-compliant encoding functions.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries and practices for handling MIME types, header encoding, and multipart form data. It carefully encodes header parameters following RFC standards, minimizing injection risks. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are typical for HTTP request preparation, with proper handling of untrusted input. The use of encode_rfc2231 and header formatting is standard and safe when used with trusted data. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for HTTP request components. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate given its utility nature. Overall, it is safe for use.",
