  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility for MIME types, header formatting, and multipart request creation. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code uses standard libraries, follows RFC standards, and handles data safely. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The low malware and risk scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard utility code for MIME, headers, and request fields. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The use of encode_rfc2231 and header handling is standard and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for handling HTTP request fields, content types, and multipart data. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and handles data securely. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The low malware score is justified; risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility code for content types, headers, and request fields. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is typical for HTTP request handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with attention to header encoding and multipart data. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as utility functions for HTTP request handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the low threat level.\n\n**Potential concerns:** The only aspect that could be misused is the header encoding via `encode_rfc2231`. If malicious header values are supplied, they could cause header injection or encoding issues. However, the code does not process untrusted input directly; it assumes the caller provides safe data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the safe handling and standard practices, a risk score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate. No need to increase unless malicious use is suspected.\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:** I agree with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is a standard, well-implemented utility for HTTP header and multipart request handling.**\n- **No malicious or obfuscated code detected.**\n- **Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1–0.2** |\n\nThese reflect a benign utility module with minimal security concerns.",
