  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for MIME type guessing, header formatting, and request field handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Header encoding follows RFC standards.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on MIME types and header encoding.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code or suspicious behavior. Use of encode_rfc2231 is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, consistent scores. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for forming multipart requests.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Use of standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Logical and consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for content types and request fields.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation. Standard practices followed.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on header encoding.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity. Header encoding is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the potential for misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but overall low.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is standard utility code with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering that malicious inputs could potentially cause issues, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a benign, well-structured utility module for HTTP request handling, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the absence of suspicious behavior.",
