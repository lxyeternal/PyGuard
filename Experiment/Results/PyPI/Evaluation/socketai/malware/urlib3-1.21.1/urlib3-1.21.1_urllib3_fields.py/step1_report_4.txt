{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for handling HTTP request fields, including guessing content types, formatting header parameters, and constructing multipart form data.",
  "sources": "Filename input in guess_content_type; header parameter values in format_header_param; data and filename in RequestField.from_tuples; headers in RequestField.make_multipart.",
  "sinks": "Header construction and formatting in format_header_param, _render_part, _render_parts, and render_headers; header assignments in make_multipart.",
  "flows": "Input data (filename, header values, form data) flows into functions for type guessing, header formatting, and request field creation; then into header rendering and multipart setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of encode_rfc2231 for header encoding is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with content type guessing, header parameter formatting, and constructing multipart HTTP request fields. It uses standard library functions such as mimetypes and email.utils.encode_rfc2231. Input parameters such as filenames, header values, and data are handled carefully, with encoding to support non-ASCII characters. The header formatting functions properly quote and encode parameters per RFC standards. The RequestField class supports constructing multipart form data with configurable headers, supporting typical use cases without executing untrusted code or leaking data. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for HTTP request construction. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious logic. Its functions and class are typical for handling multipart form data and headers securely. Based on this review, the code poses no security threat.",
