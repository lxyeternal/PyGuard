  "purpose": "Provide utilities for guessing content types, formatting headers, and managing request fields in HTTP requests, primarily for constructing multipart form-data payloads.",
  "sources": "Filename input in guess_content_type; header values in format_header_param and RequestField; data and filename in RequestField.from_tuples.",
  "sinks": "Encoding functions such as email.utils.encode_rfc2231; header rendering in render_headers; modification of headers in make_multipart.",
  "flows": "Filename input influences content type guess; header values are formatted and encoded, potentially from untrusted sources; headers are assembled into HTTP request parts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encode_rfc2231 for header parameters could potentially be misused if maliciously crafted header values are input; no explicit malicious code or backdoors; code appears straightforward and typical for HTTP request construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for content type detection and header formatting, as well as a RequestField class for encapsulating HTTP request body parameters. It includes functions for guessing MIME types based on filenames, formatting header parameters with proper encoding, and constructing multipart form-data headers with correct encoding. The use of email.utils.encode_rfc2231 ensures header values are properly encoded for non-ASCII data. The RequestField class facilitates building HTTP request parts with optional filenames and headers, supporting safe assembly of multipart requests. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The encoding and header formatting are standard practices in HTTP request construction.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions for HTTP request construction, with careful handling of header encoding and multipart data. There are no indications of malicious or sabotage code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module.",
