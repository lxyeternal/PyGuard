  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code handles MIME type guessing, header formatting, and multipart request construction.\n- It uses standard Python libraries (`mimetypes`, `email.utils`, `six`) and follows RFC standards for header encoding.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- Input parameters (filenames, header values, data) are handled with standard encoding practices.\n- The functions and class methods are typical for constructing HTTP request parts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for HTTP request fields.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; standard practices followed.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, no security concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for MIME types and headers.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; header encoding follows RFC standards.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues detected.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Handling HTTP request fields, forming multipart data.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe utility code.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score is slightly higher (0.2) but justified given the potential for header injection if untrusted input is used improperly. Still, the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for constructing multipart/form-data.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with benign utility code.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for headers and request parts.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; proper encoding.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and justified. The code does not contain malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2). These are reasonable given the functions' nature. If untrusted input is used externally, header injection or encoding issues could pose minimal risk, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications are necessary unless external inputs are maliciously crafted, which is outside the scope of this static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My Own Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, standard utility functions; slight concern if inputs are malicious but not inherent in code)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-implemented utility module for HTTP request handling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
