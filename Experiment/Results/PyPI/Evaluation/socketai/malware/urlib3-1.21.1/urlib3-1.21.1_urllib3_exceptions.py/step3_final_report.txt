{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and warnings for an HTTP client library, serving as error handling structures.",
  "sources": "Class initializations and inheritance, importing from 'six' and 'httplib' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or network interactions; error classes are passive structures.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiations and inheritance hierarchies; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception and warning class definitions for an HTTP client library. It imports from common modules and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded payloads. The class hierarchy and methods follow Python best practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard component of an HTTP client library, with no malicious or security-compromising elements. The low security risk score and zero malware score are appropriate, and the code poses no threat.",
