  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: No external data or network operations.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, imports from 'six' for compatibility, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, benign code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low, likely due to general error handling)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes and warnings.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: No data processing or network activity.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (still very low)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for HTTP, SSL, connection errors, and warnings.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Exception creation, no data handling.\n- Anomalies: No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical for a network library, no embedded malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Standard, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for connection errors, timeouts, SSL, warnings.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: Error handling, no external data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Typical for error handling in network code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for error handling in an HTTP client.\n- Source/Sink/Flow: No data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Standard exception class definitions.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; the code is standard for an HTTP client library's error handling framework, with no security risks evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception and warning class definitions.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The imports and class structures are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The high confidence scores reflect the clear, benign nature of this code.\n\n### **Recommended Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the inherent risk in error handling code, but minimal)\n\n**Summary:** This code is a legitimate, standard component of an HTTP client library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
