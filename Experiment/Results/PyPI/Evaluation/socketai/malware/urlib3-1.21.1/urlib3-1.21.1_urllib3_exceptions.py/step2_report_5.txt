  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is solely exception class definitions, importing from six and httplib, with no data processing or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard error handling classes with no malicious behavior. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still very low)\n- **Comments:** Consistent with the previous assessment. No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard error and warning classes, no data processing or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Comments:** The analysis aligns with the previous ones; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Exception classes for error handling, no external data input or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Clear, standard error class definitions with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, purely exception class definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that this code is a collection of exception and warning class definitions for an HTTP client library, likely urllib3.\n- **Malware risk:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily because the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform network operations directly.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, defining error classes for error handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as embedded payloads, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of standard modules and patterns indicates legitimate, well-understood functionality.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to error handling, not security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard set of exception class definitions for an HTTP client library, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
