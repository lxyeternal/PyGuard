  "purpose": "Provides connection pooling, proxy management, URL parsing, and request handling for HTTP/HTTPS clients.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, proxy URL, request parameters",
  "sinks": "Network requests, headers, URL components used in requests",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL parsing -> connection pool selection/creation -> request execution -> response handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard connection pooling and proxy handling with URL normalization, headers management, redirect and retry logic. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The data flow is typical for an HTTP client utility, and external functions like parse_url are assumed trustworthy. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities beyond typical network code concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP connection and proxy management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given its functionality.",
