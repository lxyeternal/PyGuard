  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of connection pooling and proxy management for HTTP/HTTPS requests.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code relies on well-known libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The functions handle URL parsing, headers, proxies, retries, redirects, and connection reuse securely.\n- The data flows involve input parameters and network requests, but nothing indicates malicious data exfiltration or code execution.\n- The reported security risk scores (around 0.2) seem reasonable given the functionality, but the malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No issues; data flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns or backdoors.\n- Correctly notes that the code appears secure and standard.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on connection pooling, URL parsing, and proxy handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as routine.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights redirect handling, URL parsing, and proxy support.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- Properly assesses the code as legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar assessment; emphasizes standard connection pooling and proxy setup.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly low at 0.2, reflecting the potential misuse if external inputs are malicious, but overall minimal risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — standard network utility code, with minimal inherent risk, but potential for misuse if inputs are malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a typical, well-structured HTTP connection and proxy management utility with no signs of supply chain or malware issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
