  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages connection pools and proxies for HTTP/HTTPS requests. It normalizes URLs, manages headers, and handles redirects and retries. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is standard and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the lack of evident vulnerabilities, and malware is rightly scored zero. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard connection pooling and proxy handling without signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The code is a typical HTTP client utility. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on connection pooling, URL normalization, and proxy support, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is standard, and the low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes connection pooling, proxy handling, redirects, and URL parsing. No malicious activity or obfuscation is observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe evaluation is accurate. The code's operations are routine for an HTTP client library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard request management, proxy support, and connection reuse, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical, well-structured implementation of connection pooling and proxy management. It relies on standard libraries, performs URL parsing, header management, and connection reuse.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code does not execute any dynamic code, handle secrets, or perform suspicious network activity.\n- **Security Risk:** The minimal risk score (0.2) is appropriate, given that improper handling of URLs or headers could, in theory, lead to security issues like header injection or redirect attacks. However, the code appears to handle these aspects correctly, assuming external functions like `parse_url` are trustworthy.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — low, consistent with standard connection management code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP connection pooling and proxy management with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of specific sections or further analysis.",
