  "purpose": "Library setup for connection pooling, logging, and warning configuration in urllib3.",
  "sources": "Imports of submodules, setting up logging handlers, warning filters, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Configuration functions that set logging handlers and warning filters; no untrusted data processed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of logging and warnings; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard library setup tasks, including logging configuration, warning filter setup, and utility function definitions. It does not process external input, perform network activity, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The warning filters are set to default or conservative levels, and the logging handler is a standard NullHandler or a simple StreamHandler. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code for urllib3, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are accurate and appropriate.",
