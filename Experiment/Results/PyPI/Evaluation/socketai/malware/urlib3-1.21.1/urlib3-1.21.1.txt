      "conclusion": "The code contains a legitimate package setup component but is embedded with obfuscated, covert network activity aimed at exfiltrating environment information to an external server. This behavior is characteristic of malicious backdoors or data theft tools. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged as malicious. The embedded network code is likely intended for covert command-and-control or data exfiltration, and its obfuscation suggests an attempt to evade detection."
