{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the setup for a Python package named 'parseweb', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no execution of external code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to populate package description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without validation; no input sanitization or handling of external data sources; standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Python package setup with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads a local README file for documentation, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. No suspicious code, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution or hardcoded secrets are present. The dependencies are minimal and benign. The code structure follows standard practice for Python packaging, with no anomalies or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies in a conventional manner.",
