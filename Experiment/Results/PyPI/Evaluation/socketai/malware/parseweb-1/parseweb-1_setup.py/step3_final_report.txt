  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module named 'parseweb' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description without exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or malicious code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling; common in setup scripts but could cause errors if the file is missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The only minor concern is the unguarded file read, which is standard practice but could be improved for robustness. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The dependency 'requests' is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor risk from unhandled file reading does not justify a higher risk score. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is.",
