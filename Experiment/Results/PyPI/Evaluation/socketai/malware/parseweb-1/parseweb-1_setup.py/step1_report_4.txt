{
  "purpose": "The code is used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content and passing it to setuptools; no user input flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling is standard; no suspicious code or secrets embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, utilizing 'setuptools' to define package info, dependencies, and classifiers. The 'open' call for 'README.md' is common practice, with no indication of malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, hidden functions, or suspicious imports are present. The dependencies and metadata appear normal and safe. The URL points to a GitHub repository unrelated to malicious activity, and no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard and benign package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
