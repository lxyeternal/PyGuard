{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'parseweb', specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read operation from 'README.md' for long_description, and static data for package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and file reading into package setup parameters; no untrusted input flows into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns detected. The 'long_description' reads from a file, which is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with metadata and dependency information. The 'long_description' reads from a local file, which is typical for package setup. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observed. All code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious behavior.",
