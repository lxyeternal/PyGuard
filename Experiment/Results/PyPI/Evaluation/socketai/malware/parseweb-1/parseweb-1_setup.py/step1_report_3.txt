{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'parseweb' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setuptools functions for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static package metadata and README file into package configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling is common but slightly risky if file is missing; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup with setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a local file for description, which is typical. No input/output from external sources at runtime, no suspicious code, no obfuscated or malicious constructs. All dependencies are legitimate; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The URL points to a public GitHub repository, and there are no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and the risk score is very low.",
