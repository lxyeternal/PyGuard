  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Module-level attribute assignments that set metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; purely metadata definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears to be standard package metadata without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward attribute assignments providing package metadata. All values are static and intended for informational purposes. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external interactions. The code is formatted with comments and Unicode characters for decoration but does not contain any malicious patterns, code injection points, or suspicious behaviors. The content aligns with standard Python package metadata conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
