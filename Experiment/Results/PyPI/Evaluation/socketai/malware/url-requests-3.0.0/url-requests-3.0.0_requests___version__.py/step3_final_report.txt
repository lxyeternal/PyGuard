{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and decorative ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for package metadata; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata without dynamic data or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments, which are decorative and do not impact security or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata for 'requests'. There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, or code execution. The ASCII art is purely decorative. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign package metadata file with decorative ASCII art. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
