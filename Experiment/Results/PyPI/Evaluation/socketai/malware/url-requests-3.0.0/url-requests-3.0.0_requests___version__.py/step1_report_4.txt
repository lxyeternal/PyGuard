{
  "purpose": "To define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including its title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, reading no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code consists of straightforward variable assignments with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string and integer values to variables that describe the package. There are no external input reads, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The metadata is typical for a Python package and contains no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate descriptive information for the 'requests' library.",
