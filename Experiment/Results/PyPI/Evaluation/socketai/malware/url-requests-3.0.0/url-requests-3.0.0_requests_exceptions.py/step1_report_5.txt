  "purpose": "Define and organize exception classes for the requests library, handling various HTTP and network errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exceptions from urllib3 and compatibility modules; class definitions for exception hierarchies.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation and raising; no explicit data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated during error conditions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors; code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes custom exception classes for the requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and third-party exceptions. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, network communications, or code injection, are present. The structure is typical for a library's exception hierarchy, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. It appears to serve its intended purpose of error handling without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in the requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears safe for use.",
