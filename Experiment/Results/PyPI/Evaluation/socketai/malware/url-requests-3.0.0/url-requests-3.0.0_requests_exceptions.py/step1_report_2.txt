  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; internal class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; primarily class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; the code is straightforward class hierarchy definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for the requests library, importing standard exceptions and defining custom exceptions for different error scenarios. The code uses inheritance to categorize exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data manipulation observed. It appears to be standard error class boilerplate for the requests library, with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is intended for error handling within the requests library and contains no suspicious behavior.",
