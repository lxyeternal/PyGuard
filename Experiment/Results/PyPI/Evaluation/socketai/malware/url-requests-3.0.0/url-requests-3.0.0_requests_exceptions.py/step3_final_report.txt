  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class constructors that initialize exception instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; exception classes do not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and inheritance; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to HTTP requests, inheriting from standard Python and third-party exceptions. There is no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or embedded secrets. The classes serve as error handlers within the requests library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static, well-structured, and intended for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and serves its purpose for error handling. There are no malicious activities, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
