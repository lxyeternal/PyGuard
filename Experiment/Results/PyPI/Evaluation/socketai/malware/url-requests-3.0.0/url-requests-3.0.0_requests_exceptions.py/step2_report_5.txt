  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code is solely defining exception classes for the Requests library.\n- They note that the code imports standard exceptions and creates custom exceptions for various error scenarios.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or external data leaks are observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and serves error handling purposes.\n\n**Assessment of the provided scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report noting 0.1. Given the code's nature, a slight mention of potential untrusted data handling is acceptable but does not indicate actual risk.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n\n- The code is purely structural; it does not process data, execute code dynamically, or communicate externally.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The only minor point is the mention of potential untrusted data in exception handling, but this is standard for error handling code and does not imply a security issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions for a well-known library.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate; minor security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the context but not indicative of any real threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall justifications:**\n\n- The code is static, defining classes only.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing scores are justified and should remain as is.",
