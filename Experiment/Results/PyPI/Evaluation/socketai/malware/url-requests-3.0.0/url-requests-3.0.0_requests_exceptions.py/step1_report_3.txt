  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various error scenarios related to HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class initializations; attribute access within classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of untrusted data in exception handling, although no direct data processing or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and propagated within the request handling flow; no external data or network flow manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the structure and implementation follow standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes with straightforward inheritance and initializations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code primarily serves as a structured error handling framework. There are no signs of code obfuscation, external data leaks, or malicious behavior. Usage of imports and class hierarchies appear standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation that could indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a HTTP request library, with no malicious intent or security threats detected. It appears safe and normal in the context of error handling infrastructure.",
