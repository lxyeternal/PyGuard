  "purpose": "Define exception classes for request handling errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class constructors and attributes handling error data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; mainly class definitions and initialization logic without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code strictly defines exception classes and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from standard libraries and defines custom exception classes for various request errors, including JSON errors, connection issues, and warnings. Constructors properly initialize class attributes without external data manipulation or network activity. No embedded or hidden malicious code, no suspicious logic, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
