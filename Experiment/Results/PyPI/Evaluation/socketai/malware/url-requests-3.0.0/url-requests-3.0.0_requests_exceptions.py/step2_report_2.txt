  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code only defines exception classes; no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0. This aligns well with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural, with no behavior indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code remains static class definitions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Justification:** Same as above; standard exception hierarchy.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Exception classes with standard inheritance.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes a slight security risk (0.1), but the code itself shows no evidence of malicious behavior. The minimal risk score might be a conservative placeholder, but given the code's nature, it should be 0.\n- **Justification:** No active security issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Justification:** Standard exception class definitions, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Justification:** Same as above; safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The only anomaly is Report 3 assigning a 0.1 risk score despite no evidence. Given the code's nature, the risk should be 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust Report 3's security risk score from 0.1 to 0.** The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior.\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0** across all reports.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security issues. The scores should reflect that, with all set to zero, especially the risk score in Report 3.",
