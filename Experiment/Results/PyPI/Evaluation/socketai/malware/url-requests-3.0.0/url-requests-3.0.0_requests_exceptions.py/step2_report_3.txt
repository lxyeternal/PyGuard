  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is solely class definitions for exceptions, imported modules, and no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, purely structural, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception class definitions with no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, safe code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Exception classes with a note on potential untrusted data in exception handling, but no actual data processing or external communication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher, but still negligible)\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity; the slight increase in security risk seems to stem from the potential handling of untrusted data in exceptions, which is standard in error handling code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard exception class definitions, no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, exception class hierarchy with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, consistent with the code's purpose as exception class definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—error handling classes—any risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The only slight concern was in Report 3 with a security risk of 0.1, but that is negligible and likely reflects standard caution rather than actual vulnerability.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for the Requests library.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The minimal \"security risk\" score in one report likely stems from the handling of untrusted data in exceptions, which is standard and safe in this context.\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and free of security issues.",
