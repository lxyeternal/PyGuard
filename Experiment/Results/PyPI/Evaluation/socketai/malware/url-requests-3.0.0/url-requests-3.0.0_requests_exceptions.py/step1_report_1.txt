  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it defines exception classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code strictly defines exception classes and imports modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to HTTP requests, extending standard Python exceptions and library exceptions. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network operations. It imports 'HTTPError' from 'urllib3.exceptions' and 'JSONDecodeError' from a compatibility module. The class hierarchy appears standard, and no suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for the Requests library without any malicious intent or behavior. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or external data handling that could compromise security.",
