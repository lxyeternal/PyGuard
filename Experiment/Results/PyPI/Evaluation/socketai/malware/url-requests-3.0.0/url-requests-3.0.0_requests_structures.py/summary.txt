  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard data structures with a minor bug in the copy() method that does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the only flaw is a functional bug. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0, with a very minor functional issue. The overall assessment confirms no malicious behavior or security concerns."
