{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive dictionary-like data structures for internal use in the Requests library, particularly for headers and lookup scenarios.",
  "sources": "Data is set via __init__, __setitem__, or update methods; data is stored internally in _store and __dict__.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval via __getitem__, get, and iteration over the dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input data (via constructor or item assignment) flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__), with retrieval functions accessing this data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The classes perform standard dictionary operations with custom case-insensitivity and lookup features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both extend standard dictionary behaviors with custom features. The first manages case-insensitive keys with internal storage that preserves original key casing. The second provides a simple lookup dictionary. No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries used for internal data management in the Requests library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks.",
