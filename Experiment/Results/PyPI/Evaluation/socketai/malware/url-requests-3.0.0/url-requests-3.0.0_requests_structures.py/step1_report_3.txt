  "purpose": "Define custom dictionary-like data structures for case-insensitive key handling and simple lookup with optional naming.",
  "sources": "Input data to constructors (`__init__`) and key-value pairs through dictionary methods (`update`, `__setitem__`).",
  "sinks": "Accessing or modifying internal data structures (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, `__init__`, `update`), but no external system calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal structures during initialization and updates; data retrieval occurs via `__getitem__` and `get`, but no external output or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `OrderedDict` for case-insensitive keys, no obvious anomalies or malicious constructs; code is straightforward and matches typical data structure implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: `CaseInsensitiveDict` which manages a case-insensitive dict-like object using `OrderedDict` for internal storage, and `LookupDict`, a simple dict subclass with optional naming. No code injection, external data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected. The code handles data purely within memory, with no external communication or file access. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or credential handling are present. The implementation appears standard and benign, focused on data handling and case-insensitive key management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup class, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks and appears safe for use.",
