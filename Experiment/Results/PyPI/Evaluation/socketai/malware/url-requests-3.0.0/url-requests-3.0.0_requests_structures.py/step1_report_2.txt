{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a lookup dictionary for internal use within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is sourced from user-provided inputs to dictionary-like objects, such as keys and values passed during instantiation or item assignment.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, nor does it perform network or system calls. It only manipulates in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys/values) flows into the data structures via initialization or item setting; internal methods access and return stored data. No external sinks are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed. The code handles dictionary data structures using standard Python features. The copy method in CaseInsensitiveDict may not return an independent copy as intended, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict manages string keys case-insensitively, storing actual key casing for display and access purposes, and implementing dictionary methods. LookupDict acts as a simple container with optional named context, extending dict with a custom __repr__. Both classes only manipulate in-memory data without external interactions. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or external communication. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionary structures with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. No security risks or malware are detected.",
