{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, and imports necessary standard libraries and dependencies for request handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and system information (sys.version_info), and attempts to import external libraries such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, and various standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or untrusted data handling beyond imports.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading system info, conditional importing of libraries, and setting up compatibility aliases. There are no data flows involving user input or external untrusted sources, nor flows leading to dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages compatibility for different Python versions and optional imports of third-party libraries like chardet and simplejson. It also sets up various import aliases and compatibility variables. The code uses try-except blocks for optional imports and sets flags accordingly. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The overall structure and content are typical for a compatibility utility module, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs benign imports and environment checks typical for supporting different Python environments.",
