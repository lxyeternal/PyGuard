  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for handling import issues between Python 2 and Python 3, managing optional dependencies, and setting environment flags.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, sys, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code sets flags and imports modules without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and version detection logic with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, handling optional dependencies and environment detection. It performs no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The import patterns and version checks are typical for such utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for compatibility purposes. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
