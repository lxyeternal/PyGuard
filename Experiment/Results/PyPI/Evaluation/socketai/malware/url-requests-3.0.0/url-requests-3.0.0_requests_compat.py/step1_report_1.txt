{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility imports and environment detection for different Python versions and modules, mainly for handling differences between Python 2 and 3, and optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookiejar, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks are present; the code primarily sets up environment compatibility. There are no data outputs, network communications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines compatibility variables, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or obfuscation. The code performs straightforward compatibility and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and handles optional dependencies with try-except blocks, which is normal for maintaining compatibility. It defines variables for Python version checks and sets up module imports accordingly. No suspicious behavior or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with optional dependencies. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe.",
