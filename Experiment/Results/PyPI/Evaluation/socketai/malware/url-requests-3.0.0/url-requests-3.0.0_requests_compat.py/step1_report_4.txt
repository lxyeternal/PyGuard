{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and imports various standard libraries and modules needed for HTTP requests and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads include importing modules such as 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'sys', 'simplejson' or 'json', and various standard library functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No specific sink functions or code execution points are present. The code mainly imports modules and assigns variables.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing optional and standard modules, assigning version info, and defining compatibility variables. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code uses typical import patterns and compatibility handling without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports for compatibility across Python versions and optional dependencies, with fallback mechanisms. It uses standard practices for imports, exception handling, and version checks. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform any network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows normal coding patterns for handling imports and version differences.",
