{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues and imports various standard library modules for backwards compatibility in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, import attempts for chardet/charset_normalizer, conditional imports of simplejson/json, standard library modules such as collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no data outputs, no external communication, and no user inputs processed directly.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; the code performs standard compatibility imports and variable definitions without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling module imports with fallback options and defining compatibility variables. No external data input is processed, no secrets are hardcoded, and no malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely compatibility, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer used in Python projects, particularly for supporting multiple Python versions and optional dependencies. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
