{
  "purpose": "The code handles import compatibility issues for Python 2 and 3, manages optional dependencies, and sets up environment-specific variables and imports for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), and optional third-party modules (chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code mainly imports modules and sets up compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward, primarily for compatibility and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules conditionally based on environment and availability, sets compatibility flags for Python 2 and 3, and assigns common types. It uses try-except blocks for optional dependencies, but there are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a compatibility shim for a larger package, and it does not perform any sensitive operations or handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages imports and compatibility flags, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
