  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the certifi package, calling 'where()' in main",
  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to standard output",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for fetching CA bundle path",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a well-known package (certifi) to retrieve the CA bundle path and prints it when executed directly. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute any malicious behavior. It is a simple utility script with a clear purpose. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for outputting the default CA bundle path used by requests or other HTTP libraries. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
