  "purpose": "The code returns the default CA certificate bundle path provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package by importing the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the result of 'where()', which outputs a file path.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, then calls 'print(where())' if executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of certifi to get CA bundle path. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known library (certifi) to obtain the default CA bundle location, then prints it when executed directly. There are no untrusted data sources, no data flows from user input, and no suspicious code or hidden behavior. The code is simple and standard in purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a utility purpose to display the certifi CA bundle path. No malicious or security concerns detected.",
