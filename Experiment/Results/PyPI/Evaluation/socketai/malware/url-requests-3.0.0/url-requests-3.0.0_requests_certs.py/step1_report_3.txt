{
  "purpose": "To return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly for use in SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The import of 'where' from the certifi package; the print statement that outputs the CA bundle location.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs data to stdout; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function is called, and its output is printed to standard output. Data flows from the certifi package through 'where' to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries as intended.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. It then prints this path if run as a main program. The code contains no user input, external network calls, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious or malicious code is present. It appears to be a simple utility script meant for debugging or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for displaying the certifi CA bundle path. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
