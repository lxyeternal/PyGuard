{
  "purpose": "The script provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the 'requests' library, primarily for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function, which locates the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code only prints the CA bundle path and does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function is called to retrieve the CA bundle path and then printed, with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard in purpose. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package 'certifi' and prints the location of the CA bundle. There are no user inputs, no untrusted data processing, and no external network interactions. It appears to be a simple utility script for retrieving and displaying the CA bundle path, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for displaying the CA certificate bundle location. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
