{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA bundle path provided by the certifi package, likely for use in HTTPS requests.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used for establishing secure connections or logging.",
  "flows": "Source (certifi.where) -> sink (print statement) — the function retrieves the path, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which provides the path to a CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path to standard output. There is no data being sent over the network, no use of untrusted input, and no suspicious behavior. The purpose appears to be to inform or verify the location of the CA bundle, possibly for debugging or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, transparent, and serves a benign purpose related to SSL/TLS configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
