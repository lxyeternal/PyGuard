  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from certifi; execution of 'print(where())' when run as a script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from certifi (source) to printing its value (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that imports 'where' from the certifi package and prints its value if executed directly. It performs no network activity, data processing, or user input handling. The purpose is to output the path to the CA bundle, which is a benign utility function. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
