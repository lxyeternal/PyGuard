  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including classes and functions for handling cookies, extracting, creating, merging, and compatibility wrappers for requests.",
  "sources": "Request URL, request headers, response headers, cookie headers, cookie dicts",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers, cookie jar modifications, header modifications",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers are read to create mock request objects; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are created, added, or removed in the cookie jar; cookie headers are generated for requests",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling functions and classes, relying on well-known libraries and practices. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. Functions perform expected operations such as creating cookies, extracting cookies from responses, managing cookie jars, and generating cookie headers. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms. The security implications are limited to typical cookie management risks, which are inherent and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with its benign, utility-focused nature.",
