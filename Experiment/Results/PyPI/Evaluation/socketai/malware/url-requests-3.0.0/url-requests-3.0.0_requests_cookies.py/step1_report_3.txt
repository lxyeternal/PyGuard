{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with the requests library, including creating, managing, and extracting cookies into CookieJar objects.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP response headers, request objects, and cookie dictionaries; input parameters for cookie creation and management functions.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction from responses, setting cookies, and generating cookie headers, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted data influences cookie handling.",
  "flows": "HTTP response headers are parsed and converted into cookie objects, which are stored in or retrieved from CookieJars. Cookies can be added, removed, or merged based on input data, with potential for untrusted data to influence cookie state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard cookie management operations. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present. All functions operate in a typical manner for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard mechanisms for cookie management compatible with requests and urllib, including creating cookies, converting between Morsel objects and cookies, extracting cookies from responses, and managing cookie jars. It does not include network communication, external data exfiltration, or any suspicious operations. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates typical utility code without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or privacy violations. The only potential concern is that untrusted input can influence cookie handling if not properly validated externally, but that is inherent to cookie handling and not specific to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie utilities for requests, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. It performs expected operations for cookie management and compatibility, with no immediate security threats identified.",
