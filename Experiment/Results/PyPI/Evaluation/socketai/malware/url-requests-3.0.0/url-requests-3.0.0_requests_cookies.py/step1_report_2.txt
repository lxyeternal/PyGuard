{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, standard libraries, and request/response objects; reads request headers, response headers, and cookie attributes.",
  "sinks": "Cookie manipulation functions that set, remove, or access cookie values; header modifications; cookie jar updates.",
  "flows": "Reads request headers and response headers, converts cookies from headers to Cookie objects, stores cookies in CookieJar, and generates cookie headers for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens; functions seem focused on cookie handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including converting cookies, extracting cookies from responses, managing cookie jars, and generating headers. All operations are consistent with standard cookie handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. No data exfiltration, network communications, or system disruptions detected. The functions operate on well-understood cookie and header objects. The only notable behavior is cookie management, which is typical for HTTP client libraries. No suspicious external network interactions or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No security risks or malware behavior identified. It serves its intended purpose without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
