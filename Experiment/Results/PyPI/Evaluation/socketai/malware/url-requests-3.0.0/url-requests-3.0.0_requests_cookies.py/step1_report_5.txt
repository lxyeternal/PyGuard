  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and classes for managing cookies in the requests library, including extraction, creation, and manipulation of cookies.",
  "sources": "Imports internal modules, standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and data from request objects such as URL, headers, and response message headers.",
  "sinks": "Functions that generate cookie headers, modify or clear cookies, and potentially interact with request and response data. No direct sink of untrusted data leading to system compromise.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from responses into a CookieJar, produces cookie headers for requests, and manages cookie storage and retrieval, including setting, deleting, and merging cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of suspicious or obscure language features. No obfuscated code. Functions appear to perform standard cookie management tasks without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of classes and functions to manage cookies within the requests library, ensuring compatibility with older modules like cookielib. It wraps request and response objects to extract and set cookies, with methods for cookie creation, deletion, copying, and merging. All functions serve legitimate cookie handling purposes. No code injects untrusted data into system commands or network connections beyond standard cookie headers. No hidden backdoors or unusual behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard cookie management operations for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It adheres to normal patterns and does not contain obfuscated or harmful code segments.",
