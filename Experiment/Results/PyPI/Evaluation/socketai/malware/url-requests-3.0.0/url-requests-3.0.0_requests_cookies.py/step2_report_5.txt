  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code's behavior, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code handles cookie creation, extraction, and management without malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs typical cookie management tasks, with no network or system compromise mechanisms.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie utilities, with potential for untrusted data influence but no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward, operating on cookie data and headers. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility wrappers and cookie management functions, with no malicious signs.\n- **Assessment:** All operations are standard, with no suspicious external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie management, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Functions are standard and serve legitimate purposes.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, and the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code performs cookie handling, which is inherently expected and safe in this context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, primarily related to the inherent risks of cookie handling if misused, but nothing malicious.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, standard, and safe for its intended purpose. No signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.",
