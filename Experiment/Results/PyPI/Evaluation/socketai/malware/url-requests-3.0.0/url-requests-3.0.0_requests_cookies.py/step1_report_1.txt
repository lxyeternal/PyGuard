  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies in requests, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookie jars and cookies.",
  "sources": "Code reads request URLs, headers, and cookie data from cookies and cookies-related objects.",
  "sinks": "Functions produce cookie headers for requests, modify cookie jars, and extract cookies from responses. These could affect request behavior and cookie management.",
  "flows": "Input from request URL, headers, and response headers flow into cookie creation, extraction, and header generation functions. Cookies are created or modified, then headers are produced or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of standard library functions, no obfuscation, no hidden network activity, or system damage code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms for handling cookies in the requests library, including creating cookies, converting cookies from cookies' dicts, merging cookies, and extracting cookies from responses. All functions perform standard cookie management operations with no suspicious or malicious logic. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments detected. The code relies on standard libraries and typical cookie handling logic. The cookie jar class extends a standard implementation with dict-like interfaces, with no evidence of malicious modification or backdoors. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended solely for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of cookie handling for requests, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages cookies properly and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. Therefore, it can be considered safe.",
