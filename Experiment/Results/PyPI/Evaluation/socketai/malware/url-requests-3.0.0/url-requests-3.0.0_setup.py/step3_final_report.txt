{
  "purpose": "The code performs package setup and, on Windows systems, downloads and executes remote files, potentially establishing backdoors or malicious control channels.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs fetched via requests.get(), reading system environment variables, subprocess calls executing downloaded content.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions of downloaded files, moving and deleting batch scripts, remote code execution without validation.",
  "flows": "Requests fetch remote files -> Files are saved locally -> Files are moved and executed via subprocess -> Files are deleted after execution.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling masking errors, use of shell=True in subprocess calls, remote IP addresses hardcoded, downloading and executing remote scripts without validation, code embedded in package setup script, minimal obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard package setup procedures but includes a malicious segment that activates on Windows. It installs requests if missing, then downloads files from suspicious IP addresses, executes them via subprocess with shell=True, and cleans up. The remote URLs and execution behavior strongly indicate malicious intent, such as backdoor installation or remote control. Exception handling is broad, masking errors, and the use of shell=True increases risk. The code is straightforward and not heavily obfuscated, but the malicious activities justify high severity scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior involving remote code download and execution, privilege checks, and system manipulation. It should be classified as highly malicious with a malware score of 1, high security risk, and minimal obfuscation.",
