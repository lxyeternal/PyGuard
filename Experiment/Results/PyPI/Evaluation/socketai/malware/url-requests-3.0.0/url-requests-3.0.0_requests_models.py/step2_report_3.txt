  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard request/response handling, URL parsing, header validation, encoding, cookies, hooks, etc.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows, no hardcoded credentials, no network calls or backdoors. The code is consistent with typical HTTP client behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, with no malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware. The confidence is high (0.9), and security risk is low (0.1).\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard library code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request/response handling, URL parsing, encoding, cookie management, and response parsing.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, network exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.95), but overall similar findings.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, describes typical HTTP request/response logic, including URL handling, encoding, cookies, and response parsing.\n- No suspicious activity, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- Confidence is high (0.95), security risk minimal (0.2).\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis: standard request/response classes, encoding, hooks, cookies, response iteration.\n- No malicious activity, network connections, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is perfect (1.0), security risk negligible.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Focuses on standard request/response handling, with hooks allowing arbitrary code execution, but this is a normal feature of such libraries.\n- No evidence of malicious code, network exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but overall no suspicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that is standard for an HTTP client library, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Malware Indicators:** None detected. No network activity or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, consistent with well-maintained, open-source HTTP client code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (standard, low-risk code)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response library with no security concerns.",
