{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive HTTP request and response handling library, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding, cookie management, request preparation, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, data, files, json, params, auth, cookies, and hooks; URL parsing functions; request body encoding routines.",
  "sinks": "Request object construction, header setting, body encoding, response content decoding, and hook execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request and response objects through preparation methods; URL and headers are processed and encoded; response content is streamed and decoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, network exfiltration, or backdoors; standard use of hooks and encoding routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client implementation. It handles URL parsing, encoding, headers, cookies, request preparation, and response parsing using common libraries and patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The hooks mechanism allows arbitrary code execution, but this is a controlled extensibility feature typical of such libraries. The response handling includes streaming, decoding, and error management consistent with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard HTTP request/response handling module. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score reflects the potential for hooks to execute arbitrary code, but this is an expected feature, not a vulnerability.",
