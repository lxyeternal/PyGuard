      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The combination of obfuscation, external domain, silent execution, and error suppression warrants classifying this package as highly malicious with a security risk score of approximately 0.9. It should be rejected or quarantined pending further analysis."
