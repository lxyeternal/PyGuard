  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious activity in the provided code snippets. Dynamic features such as eval and dynamic imports introduce some risk but are not definitive indicators of malware. The scores are justified and aligned with the analysis, suggesting the code is generally safe but warrants further review if deployed or modified. The reports are consistent, and the scoring accurately reflects the observed features."
