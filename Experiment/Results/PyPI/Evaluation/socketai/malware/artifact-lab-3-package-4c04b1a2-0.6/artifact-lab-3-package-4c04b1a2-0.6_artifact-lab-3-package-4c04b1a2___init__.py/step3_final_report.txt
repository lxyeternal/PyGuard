  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, file reads, dynamic code execution (eval, exec, dynamic imports), complex structures, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables or network, dynamic code execution points, external data outputs, and file writes.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, files) to dynamic execution points, data processing functions, and output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, dynamic imports, complex or obfuscated code structures, lack of code in some reports, potential for dynamic code execution without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that benign scripts show straightforward data processing with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malware signals. Dynamic code execution features, such as eval and dynamic imports, are flagged as potential risks but are not definitive indicators of malicious intent. Reports lacking code are correctly marked as low risk, with scores reflecting the absence of suspicious activity. The most concerning code features involve dynamic execution, which warrants cautious scoring. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described code features, with low malware likelihood (around 0.2), moderate obfuscation (around 0.4), and moderate security risk (around 0.4) for code containing dynamic features. The confidence levels are appropriate, and no false positives are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no confirmed malicious activity in the provided code snippets. Dynamic features such as eval and dynamic imports introduce some risk but are not definitive indicators of malware. The scores are justified and aligned with the analysis, suggesting the code is generally safe but warrants further review if deployed or modified. The reports are consistent, and the scoring accurately reflects the observed features.",
