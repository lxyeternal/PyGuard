{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or script that interacts with system or network resources, possibly for data processing or communication.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, configuration files, or user input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data may reach network sockets, system commands, or file writes, potentially leading to data leaks or command injection.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from user input or environment variables to network functions or system calls, possibly without proper validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors detected; however, there is some obfuscated or complex code structure that warrants scrutiny. Use of dynamic execution or eval functions should be checked.",
  "analysis": "The code includes typical utility functions, but contains sections with dynamic code execution and potentially insecure handling of input data. No explicit malicious behavior like network exfiltration or system damage is evident, but the use of eval and dynamic import hints at potential obfuscation or malicious intent. Code structure indicates some level of complexity or attempt to hide intentions. No hardcoded secrets detected, but the overall design warrants caution due to dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show clear malicious behavior but contains patterns (eval, dynamic imports) that could be exploited or used maliciously. No direct evidence of malware, but security risks are present due to dynamic execution methods. Overall, cautious review is recommended before deployment.",
