{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no external dependencies or input handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or outputs affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that outputs a static message. It contains no input, no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The code poses no security threat, and the analysis is consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward 'Hello, World!' implementation suitable for demonstration or educational purposes.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
