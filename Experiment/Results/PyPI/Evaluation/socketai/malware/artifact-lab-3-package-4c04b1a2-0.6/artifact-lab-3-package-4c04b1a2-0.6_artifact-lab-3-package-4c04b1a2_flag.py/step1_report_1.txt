  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print 'Hello, World!' and does not perform any other operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external interactions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since no input or output operations involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes a function that prints a static message. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, and no security-sensitive operations. It does not interact with environment variables, files, network, or user input. It appears to be a simple demonstration or placeholder function without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It serves a basic purpose and does not pose security risks.",
