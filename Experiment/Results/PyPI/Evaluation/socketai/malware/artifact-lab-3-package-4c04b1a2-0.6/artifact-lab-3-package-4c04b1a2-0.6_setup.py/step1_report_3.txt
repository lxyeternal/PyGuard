{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and, upon installation or development setup, exfiltrate environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables collected via os.environ at the notmalfunc() function",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the specified ngrok URL (https://5cecdbdb0328.ngrok.app/collect)",
  "flows": "os.environ data → urllib.parse.urlencode → urllib.request.Request → urllib.request.urlopen to remote server",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is embedded within package setup commands and executes during install/develop phases, exfiltrating environment variables without user consent. Use of an ngrok URL indicates potential command and control or data exfiltration. The code does not appear to serve legitimate package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. The critical part is the notmalfunc() function, which collects all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external URL during both installation and development setup phases. This behavior is unusual and suspicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive information without user awareness. The URL used (ngrok URL) suggests an external server controlled by an attacker or malicious actor. No legitimate package functionality is evident; the main activity appears to be data theft via environment variable exfiltration. No obfuscation or complex malicious code is present; the malicious intent is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a clear malicious component that exfiltrates environment variables upon installation or development setup, indicating malicious intent. It does not provide any legitimate functionality and is designed to leak data stealthily. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
