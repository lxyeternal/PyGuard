{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that send environment variables to an external server upon installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to https://5cecdbdb0328.ngrok.app/collect with encoded environment data",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected and encoded, then sent via an HTTP request during post-installation or post-develop script execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Ngrok URL to exfiltrate environment variables; functions named 'notmalfunc' with misleading naming; code is set to execute automatically after package installation or development setup; no user interaction required",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines custom classes to run functions after installation or development setup. The function 'notmalfunc' collects all environment variables and sends them to an external URL, which is typical for data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded URL indicates malicious intent. The code executes this function unconditionally during package setup phases. No user input validation, obfuscation, or encryption is present, and the data exfiltration occurs silently, indicating malicious behavior. The code structure and naming do not obfuscate the malicious intent, but the malicious activity itself is concealed within normal setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server during package installation or development. The hardcoded URL and the automatic execution strongly suggest an intentional security breach, likely for data theft or unauthorized surveillance.",
