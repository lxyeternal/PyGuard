{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation and development commands for a Python package, with an embedded function to exfiltrate environment variables to a remote server after installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ, executed during package install or develop commands",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a remote Ngrok URL with environment data, triggered after installation or development",
  "flows": "os.environ → notmalfunc() → urllib.request.urlopen(req) to send data",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is designed to collect and transmit environment variables without user consent, triggered automatically post-installation or development; the URL used is an external, potentially malicious server; code runs during setup phases, which is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and defines a function notmalfunc() that collects all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external server URL. This function is invoked automatically after both install and develop commands, ensuring that environment data is exfiltrated during typical setup processes. The URL appears to be controlled externally, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive environment variables. Such behavior resembles malicious activity aimed at data theft, which is hidden within the setup process. No other suspicious or malicious code (e.g., backdoors, code injection, or payloads) is present outside this environment exfiltration mechanism. The code structure, with setup commands and environment data leakage, indicates malicious intent or, at best, an unintended security risk, depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically the exfiltration of environment variables to an external server during package installation or development, which is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
