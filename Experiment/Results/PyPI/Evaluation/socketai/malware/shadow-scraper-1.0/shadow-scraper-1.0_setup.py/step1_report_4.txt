{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a malicious data stealer targeting Discord, Steam, Roblox, Roblox cookies, browser passwords, cookies, wallet information, and other sensitive data for exfiltration and reporting via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Sources include local file paths for browser data (local state, logins, cookies, leveldb), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), and URL requests to various APIs for user info, payment info, and platform data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into web requests to the specified Discord webhook URL, where all stolen data is exfiltrated, including tokens, cookies, passwords, browser data, and other sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from various local storage files, decrypted (using Windows' Data Protection API and AES), then sent via POST requests or URL open requests to the webhook, creating a source-to-sink data exfiltration pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses exec('') with empty strings (no functional purpose), extensive obfuscation/complexity, malicious intent evident from functions collecting tokens, cookies, passwords, and private info, and the inclusion of hardcoded webhook URL. The script also kills processes, zips sensitive files, and uploads them, indicating malicious behavior. It also installs dependencies automatically, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing many modules, including some that are unnecessary for benign operation (e.g., windll, ctypes, threading, subprocess). It attempts to install missing dependencies like requests and pycryptodome silently. It defines functions for decrypting Windows stored data, extracting tokens from browser files, accessing Discord, Roblox, Steam, and other platforms, and exfiltrating this info to a Discord webhook. It also searches for passwords, cookies, wallets, and other sensitive files in common directories. The use of process termination, zipping files, and uploading to anonymous file hosts further supports malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, detailed data extraction, and multiple exfiltration methods strongly indicates a comprehensive information stealer aimed at user compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to stealthily extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, browser info, gaming account info, and files, then report via a Discord webhook. The script contains multiple red flags typical of malware, including obfuscation attempts, process termination, file zipping, and stealthy data collection.",
