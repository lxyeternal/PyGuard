  "conclusion": "The code is a high-severity credential and data stealer, actively exfiltrating sensitive user information from browsers, applications, and files. It employs obfuscation, process termination, and external uploads to evade detection and maximize data theft. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malicious intent is clear and deliberate."
