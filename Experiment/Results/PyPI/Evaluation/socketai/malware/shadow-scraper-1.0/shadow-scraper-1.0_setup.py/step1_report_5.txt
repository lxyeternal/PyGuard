{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract various user data from browsers, Discord tokens, gaming accounts, and other sensitive information, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks and upload files to external file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (browser storage, cookies, login data, local state), and network requests to retrieve tokens, cookies, passwords, account info, and files from the user system.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to Discord webhooks and external upload services, writes data to local files, and executes external processes like pip installs and process termination.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, network responses) are processed to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, etc., which are then formatted and sent to external endpoints via HTTP POST requests. Files are zipped and uploaded, with URLs shared via webhook messages.",
  "anomalies": "Code employs obfuscated dynamic imports, multiple `exec('')`) calls, extensive use of threading for parallel data extraction, and performs system commands like taskkill, which are typical for malicious activity. It installs dependencies at runtime, fetches data from various browsers, and exfiltrates via Discord webhooks, all indicating malicious intent. The code also hardcodes a Discord webhook URL, employs extensive data collection, and has functions to extract tokens, cookies, passwords, and account info, indicative of data theft behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a stealer, targeting Discord tokens, browser credentials, cookies, and other sensitive data from multiple browsers and applications. It then exfiltrates this information through Discord webhooks and uploads files to anonymous hosting services. The code uses obfuscation techniques (dynamic import, threading, variable renaming), system commands, and network requests to external services, all typical signs of malicious activity. It does not contain any legitimate functionality beyond data collection. The presence of hardcoded webhook, runtime dependency installation, and aggressive data harvesting strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files, then exfiltrate the data via webhooks and file uploads. It employs obfuscation, system manipulation, and external network communication typical of malicious data theft tools. The overall security risk is extremely high, and it should not be used or executed.",
