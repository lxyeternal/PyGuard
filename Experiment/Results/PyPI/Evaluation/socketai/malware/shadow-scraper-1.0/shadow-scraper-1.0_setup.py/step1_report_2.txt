{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a malicious Python payload designed for token theft, data exfiltration, credential harvesting, file theft, and potentially other malicious activities such as capturing cookies, passwords, and system information, then exfiltrating it via webhooks or upload links. It also collects Discord tokens, browser data, gaming account info, and personal files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local browser files (.log, .ldb, Local State), database files (Login Data), cookies, browser extension folders, and user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Videos). It also reads specific paths for wallet files, Steam, Roblox, and other application data.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data to external URLs (Discord webhook, transfer.sh, anonfiles). Executes system commands (taskkill). Installs packages via pip. Sends HTTP POST requests with sensitive information. Writes files with stolen data to temp directories and uploads them.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading system files, browser data, credentials, cookies, and tokens to decryption functions. Extracted tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are then sent via HTTP requests to external servers (webhook, transfer.sh, anonfiles). File collections and zip uploads also transfer data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec('') with empty string to execute potentially malicious code. Dynamic package installation with subprocess.Popen. Extensive use of threading for parallel data collection. Obfuscated variable names. Collects a wide range of sensitive user data and system info. Presence of hardcoded webhook URL. Collects and uploads browser cookies, passwords, tokens, Roblox, Steam, Roblox, and Roblox account info. The code structure appears intentionally obfuscated and complex to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with setting up environment variables and loading dependencies, installing missing packages silently. It defines functions for decrypting Windows stored data, checking tokens, collecting Discord user info, browser cookies, passwords, Roblox, Steam, and Roblox tokens, and other credentials. It gathers system information, files, and personal data from various locations and applications, then exfiltrates via webhooks and uploads. The script uses multiple threads to accelerate data collection, indicates malicious activity with collection of login tokens, cookies, passwords, gaming info, and files, then sends everything to external URLs. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, use of exec(''), and the broad scope of data theft strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to harvest sensitive user information including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, browser data, gaming accounts, and personal files. It exfiltrates this data to external servers and uploads files to anonymous hosting services. Its structure and activities are consistent with malware aimed at data theft, credential harvesting, and system infiltration.",
