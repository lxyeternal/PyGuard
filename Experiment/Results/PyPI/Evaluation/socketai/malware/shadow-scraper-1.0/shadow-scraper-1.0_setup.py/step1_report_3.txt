{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal data from browsers, Discord, Roblox, Steam, Roblox, and other applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and upload services.",
  "sources": "Reading browser data files, local state files, log and leveldb files, cookies from browsers, and application-specific files (e.g., Steam, Roblox, wallet files).",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration via Discord webhook, requests to external URLs (transfer.sh, anonfiles), requests to Discord API endpoints for user info, token validation, and data submission to remote servers.",
  "flows": "Extraction of tokens, cookies, passwords, and sensitive data from local files; decryption of encrypted values; sending collected data directly to external webhooks and upload services.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution with exec(''), extensive use of obfuscated and complex string manipulations, and conditional logic for stealing multiple types of user credentials and data across various applications; attempt to bypass security and detection by encrypting, decrypting, and obfuscating data flow paths. The code also kills processes, zips files, and uploads data covertly, which are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a credential stealer and information exfiltration tool. It gathers browser cookies, saved passwords, and tokens from various Chromium-based browsers, Opera, Yandex, Edge, and Discord local storage files. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows-specific APIs and master keys. Additionally, it collects Roblox and Steam user data, including profile info, robux amount, and Steam wallet balance, then sends this data via a Discord webhook. It also searches for files containing keywords related to passwords, wallets, and sensitive information across user directories, compresses and uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services. The code includes process-killing commands, obfuscation, and dynamic module installation, indicating an intent to operate stealthily. Overall, the code is clearly malicious, designed to steal user credentials and sensitive data, and exfiltrate it covertly.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is malicious in nature, functioning as a credential and data stealer that targets multiple applications and browsers. It covertly collects sensitive user data, decrypts encrypted credentials, and exfiltrates the information to external webhooks and hosting services. The use of obfuscation, process termination, dynamic code execution, and comprehensive data collection strongly indicates malicious intent with high security risk. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for any legitimate purpose.",
