{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data from various applications, including browsers, Discord tokens, Steam info, Roblox info, cookies, and files, and then send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads input from local browser storage files, 'Local State' files, log and database files, cookies databases, and local directories for user files and passwords.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted data to a Discord webhook URL, uploads files to anonymous file sharing services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), and executes pip install commands. Also captures tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Reads sensitive data from local files and directories, decrypts or extracts tokens, cookies, and passwords, then formats and exfiltrates this data via HTTP POST requests to webhooks and file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad, suspicious pattern matching for tokens; includes extensive code for browser cookie extraction, credential theft, and file exfiltration; dynamically installs modules; executes system commands to kill processes; extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection; hardcoded webhook URL; functions for collecting cookies, tokens, passwords, and other sensitive info from various browsers and apps.",
  "analysis": "The code actively searches for and decrypts stored credentials, cookies, and tokens from multiple browsers and applications, exfiltrates this data to external webhooks, and uploads files anonymously. It uses obfuscated variable names and broad regex patterns to capture tokens and passwords. It performs multiple network requests to fetch IP, send data, and upload files. The code also kills processes related to wallets and browsers to access data and manipulates files for extraction. These behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent, aiming to steal user data and exfiltrate it surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious behavior, including credential and token theft, cookie harvesting, and data exfiltration to external servers. It is designed to covertly gather sensitive user data from browsers, applications, and games, then send or upload this data without user consent. Overall security risk is extremely high.",
