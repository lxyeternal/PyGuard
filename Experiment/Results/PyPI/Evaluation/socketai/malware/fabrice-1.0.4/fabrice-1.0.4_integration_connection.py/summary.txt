  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test suite with no malicious intent or behavior. The use of hardcoded credentials is acceptable within a testing environment but should be secured or removed in production. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content."
