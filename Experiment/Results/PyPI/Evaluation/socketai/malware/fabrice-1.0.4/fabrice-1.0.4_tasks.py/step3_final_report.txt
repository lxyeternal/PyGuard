  "purpose": "Automation for packaging, testing, and releasing Python packages, including environment setup and build steps.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration files, hardcoded strings, file system paths, subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (`c.run`), environment variable modifications, dynamic imports, sys.path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and hardcoded credentials flow into subprocess commands, environment setups, and configuration changes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass', 'localghost', 'admin'), sys.path modifications, environment variable manipulations, and installing specific package versions.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily build and release automation with some insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert malicious activities. The insecure secrets pose security risks but do not constitute malware. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic beyond insecure credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations, which could be exploited if environment security is compromised. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4 to 0.6), primarily due to insecure secrets, but no active malicious intent is evident.",
