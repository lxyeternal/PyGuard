  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package named 'fabrice', including dependencies, versioning, and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), file contents (_version.py, README.rst), and filesystem (directory checks, package files).",
  "sinks": "Uses data from environment variables, file reads, and package metadata to set up package configuration; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package name and binary; filesystem checks determine package structure; file contents set version info; these flow into the setuptools.setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The code strictly manages package setup and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: reading environment variables to determine package version, reading files for version info and long description, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted data is used in a harmful way. The environment variable is used only for configuration, and file reads are for legitimate setup purposes. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It securely reads necessary configuration data for package installation. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
