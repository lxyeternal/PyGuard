{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'fabrice', configuring dependencies, package discovery, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', file reads ('_version.py', 'README.rst'), directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', package discovery via setuptools.find_packages().",
  "sinks": "exec() call for '_version.py', open() for README, setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies, os.environ.get() for environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines package versioning; directory checks influence package name; reading '_version.py' loads version info; setup() uses all gathered data for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from '_version.py' without validation; no input validation on environment variable; no suspicious or malicious code is present; dependencies are standard; no network activity or secret leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup procedures for a Python package. The environment variable influences package naming. Directory checks determine package version. The version is loaded dynamically from a file using exec(), which is a common but slightly risky pattern if the file contents are malicious—however, it's standard practice in setup scripts. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or hardcoded credentials are present. All dependencies and paths are standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The overall structure is typical for a setup script and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The only minor concern is the use of exec() on local files, which is common but should be reviewed in the context of the entire package. Overall, the code appears safe.",
