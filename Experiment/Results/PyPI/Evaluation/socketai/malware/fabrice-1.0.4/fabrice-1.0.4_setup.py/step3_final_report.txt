  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'fabrice' Python package, configuring dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, checks for directory presence, reads version info from '_version.py', reads README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or credential handling present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and directory checks influence package naming; version info loaded via exec() from '_version.py'; README content used for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if '_version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. The main concern is the use of exec() to evaluate '_version.py', which could be exploited if the file is maliciously altered. No network activity, credential handling, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The environment variable and directory checks are standard. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are justified given the pattern. Overall, the script is low risk, with the only caveat being the exec() pattern, which is common but should be validated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be validated. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
