      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations, which could be exploited if environment security is compromised. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4 to 0.6), primarily due to insecure secrets, but no active malicious intent is evident."

The use of hardcoded credentials is acceptable within a testing environment but should be secured or removed in production. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content."
