  "purpose": "Import statements for module components, likely setting up the package's interface and internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as _version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; this code only imports classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing various components from internal modules. No functions, data processing, or external input handling present. The imports suggest a modular design. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues. As it is purely structural setup, the code itself appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It is typical for Python packages to organize code in this manner.",
