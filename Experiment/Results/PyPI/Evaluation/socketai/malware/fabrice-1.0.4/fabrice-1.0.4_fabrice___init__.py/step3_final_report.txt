{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module initializer or API exposure point, importing internal components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: _version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements do not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static imports, no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, typical for exposing package API. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The code is static and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. No issues or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
