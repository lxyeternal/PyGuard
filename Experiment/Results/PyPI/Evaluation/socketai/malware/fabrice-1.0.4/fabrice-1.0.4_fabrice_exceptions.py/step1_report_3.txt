{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a larger application, possibly related to task management or environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; the code only defines classes.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only contains class definitions and no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. Comment suggests possible future relocation but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines three custom exception classes, each with specific intended uses. There are no data inputs, external communications, or sensitive operations. The comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on exception handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application and does not pose any supply chain threat.",
