  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a Python application, including general exceptions, grouped errors, and environment configuration issues.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; as this is class definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, including 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'. These are standard, simple, and contain no data handling, network activity, or cryptic code. There are no embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The comments and structure suggest intention for error handling, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes used for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform network actions, or contain obfuscated code. It appears safe and benign.",
