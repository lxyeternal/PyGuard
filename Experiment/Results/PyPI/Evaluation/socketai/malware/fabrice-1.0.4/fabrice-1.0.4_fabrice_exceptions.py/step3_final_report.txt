  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with comments indicating potential future refactoring.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple, well-documented custom exception classes with no data processing, external interactions, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious activity, contains obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of straightforward exception class definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
