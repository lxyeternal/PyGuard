  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of simple, well-documented custom exception class definitions with no data handling, external interactions, or malicious patterns. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present in the code itself.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and lacks any malicious or obfuscated elements. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**  \n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- Security Risk: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**  \nSince all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is simple exception class definitions, there is no justification for higher scores. The risk is effectively nonexistent.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the malware score**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, as there is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns. This is appropriate.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency in scores**  \nScores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions with clear purposes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
