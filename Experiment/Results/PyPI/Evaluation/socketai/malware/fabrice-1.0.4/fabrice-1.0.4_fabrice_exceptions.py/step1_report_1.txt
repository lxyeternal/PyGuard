  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a larger application, potentially related to task management or environment configuration.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions with static exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and conventional with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three custom exception classes with clear and documented purposes. No input parsing, data handling, or external interactions are present. The classes are simple, inherit from Exception, and serve to categorize specific error types. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious activities, or security risks detected.",
