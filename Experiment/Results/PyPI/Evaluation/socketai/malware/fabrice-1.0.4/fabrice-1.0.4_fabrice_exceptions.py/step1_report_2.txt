  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application or library.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code defines classes and exception handling logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. Each class inherits from Exception and serves as a specific error indicator, with GroupException storing a result object. There is no handling of untrusted data, no network operations, no code injection, or other malicious behavior. The comments indicate typical usage and documentation but do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation. Overall, the code is straightforward, defining exception types for application logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
