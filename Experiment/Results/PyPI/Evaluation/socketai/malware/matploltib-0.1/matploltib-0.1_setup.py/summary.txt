  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its heavy obfuscation, system API interactions, privilege checks, and file manipulations point toward malicious intent such as system sabotage, persistence, or covert payload execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-1, obfuscated ~0.8-1, security risk ~0.85-0.9) are justified. It should be flagged as malware and avoided. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended if needed."
