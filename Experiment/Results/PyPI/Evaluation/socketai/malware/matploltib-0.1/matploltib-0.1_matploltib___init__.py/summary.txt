  "conclusion": "The reports generally indicate low to moderate security risks, with Report 3 being the most suspicious due to eval usage and obfuscation. The current scoring is appropriate; however, increasing the malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to around 0.5 would better capture the potential threat. No other adjustments are necessary."
