  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed conditionally. The activity aligns with typical malware tactics like obfuscation, concealment, and remote command execution. Scores of malware 0.85, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.85 are justified based on these indicators."
