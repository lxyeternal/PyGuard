  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is malicious, demonstrating remote payload download, stealthy persistence, obfuscation, and dynamic execution. Despite minor bugs, its behaviors strongly indicate malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and risk scores should be at or near 1, and obfuscation scores around 0.75-0.8. Overall, the code poses a high threat and should be flagged accordingly."
