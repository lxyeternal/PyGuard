  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input data",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the 'send' function to transmit messages, possibly over a network",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'send' function; no internal implementation shown",
  "anomalies": "The function body is empty ('pass'), indicating no actual implementation or logic; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but lacks implementation. There are no data manipulations, network calls, or other operations. The function's presence without implementation is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior. However, the absence of logic also means it cannot be evaluated for malicious activities within this fragment. Since no code is executed, no malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a placeholder or stub.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, non-functional placeholder for a message-sending operation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present in this fragment. Its security risk is negligible, but its purpose remains incomplete.",
