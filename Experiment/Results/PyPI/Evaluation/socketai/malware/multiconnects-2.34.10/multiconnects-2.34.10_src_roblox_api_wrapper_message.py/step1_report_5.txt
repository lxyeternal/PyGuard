  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not explicitly defined; the function body is empty",
  "flows": "Data flows from user, recipient, message inputs, but no actual processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "Function is a stub with no implementation; no data processing or external interactions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' with parameters for user, recipient, and message but contains no logic or implementation. There are no operations, data handling, or external calls. This suggests the code is either incomplete or a placeholder, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. Since the function does nothing, there's no apparent malicious intent or malicious behavior embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a placeholder function with no operational logic or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this snippet.",
