{
  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code; potential sink if message or recipient are used insecurely",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (user, recipient, message) to the message sending process, which is currently a placeholder",
  "anomalies": "The function body is empty (pass statement), which means no implementation or malicious activity is present; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function intended for messaging but lacks implementation. There are no data operations, no external calls, and no apparent security issues. The function's purpose aligns with messaging, but without implementation, it cannot perform any action or malicious activity. There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present. Overall, the code is benign and appears to be a stub or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, unimplemented placeholder for a messaging function. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security issues are evident. It appears safe but non-functional in its current state.",
