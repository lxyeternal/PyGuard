{
  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a User to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The function parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are sources of input data.",
  "sinks": "There are no implemented sinks; the function body is empty.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters to nowhere, as the function does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a placeholder with no implementation; no anomalies are present in the code as-is.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but contains an empty body, meaning it performs no actions. There are no external data reads, no data processing, no external calls, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder, possibly intended for future implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines a function with no operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
