{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' parameters are inputs; the function may receive data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'send' operation, which is not implemented here but would likely involve outputting or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' into the 'send' function; actual transmission or output is not implemented.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message', intended to transmit messages. There are no operations within the function body; it is a placeholder. No external data reading, no data leakage, and no suspicious activity or malicious behavior are evident. The lack of implementation does not indicate malicious intent; it appears to be incomplete or a stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder function with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any actions and contains no malware or security risks.",
