  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to send a message from a User to a recipient",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external calls present",
  "flows": "Parameters pass data into the function; no further flow as function body is empty",
  "anomalies": "No implementation, no code execution, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating it is a stub. No data is processed, no external calls or network activity occur, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The function's purpose is clear but unimplemented, posing no security risks. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and lack of implementation. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and the scoring appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
