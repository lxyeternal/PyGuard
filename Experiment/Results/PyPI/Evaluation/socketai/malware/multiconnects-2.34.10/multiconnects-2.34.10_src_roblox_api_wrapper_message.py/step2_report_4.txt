  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code defines a `send` function with parameters `user`, `recipient`, and `message`.\n   - The function body is empty (`pass`), indicating it is a stub or placeholder.\n   - No implementation, external calls, data processing, or network activity is present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Anomalies**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is benign and non-functional, serving only as a placeholder.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, likely due to the potential for misuse if implemented maliciously in the future. Since the code is a stub, this risk is minimal.\n\n4. **Evaluation of the Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting the certainty that the code is benign and a placeholder.\n\n5. **Critical Observations**:\n   - Since the code is just a stub, it cannot perform any malicious activity in its current form.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.\n   - Any potential future risks depend on how this placeholder is used or replaced, but as-is, there are no concerns.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score**: Given the placeholder nature and lack of implementation, a risk score of **0** is appropriate, although a very minimal risk (e.g., 0.1) could be considered if future implementation introduces vulnerabilities. But in this context, 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the current state of the code and the analysis provided.",
