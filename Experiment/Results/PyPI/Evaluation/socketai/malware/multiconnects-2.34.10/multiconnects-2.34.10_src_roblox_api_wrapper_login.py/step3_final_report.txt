  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API; currently unimplemented scaffolds.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (inputs), no data processing or external calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; functions do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty, unimplemented; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions intended for login processes, with no logic, data handling, or network activity. The functions are placeholders, not executing any operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's benign state is consistent with the absence of data flows or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless in its current form, serving as scaffolding for future implementation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores should reflect this benign status.",
