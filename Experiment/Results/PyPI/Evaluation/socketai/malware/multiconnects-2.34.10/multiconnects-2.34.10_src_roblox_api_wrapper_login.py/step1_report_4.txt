  "purpose": "Provides placeholder functions for Roblox login via cookies or username/password",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password'",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or output functions implemented",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; potential placeholder for malicious code, but currently benign",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for login processes but lacks implementation. No data processing, network requests, or data leaks are present. The functions could be placeholders for malicious behavior if later implemented, but as-is, there's no active malicious activity or security risk. The code is minimal and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Since no actual code executes or processes data, risks are negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal placeholder with no active logic or malicious behavior. It does not perform any operations, making it harmless in its current state.",
