{
  "purpose": "The code provides placeholder functions intended for login operations to the Roblox API, potentially for automation or user authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie' in cookielogin; 'username' and 'password' in userpasslogin.",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks are present since the functions are unimplemented; however, if implemented, they could handle sensitive data such as credentials or session cookies.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the functions currently only pass without processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The comments suggest future development but do not reveal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two placeholder functions intended for login processes. There are no active data operations, no processing of inputs, and no execution of network requests or sensitive actions. The comments indicate planned features but currently do nothing. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign placeholder code with no malicious behavior or security risks at present. It appears to be a skeleton for future implementation rather than malicious or risky code.",
