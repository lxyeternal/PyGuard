{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login procedures to the Roblox API, currently non-functional.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'. No data reading occurs within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling is present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present since functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined with no implementation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two stub functions intended for authentication: 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'. Both functions currently do nothing and do not perform any operations or data processing. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, nor any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a scaffold or placeholder for future implementation without any malicious intent at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simply placeholder function definitions for login mechanisms with no active logic or data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in its current form.",
