  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All functions are placeholders, with no implementation.\n- No data flows, external calls, or data processing occur.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The purpose is clearly stated as scaffolding or future development.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, reflecting the functions' inert nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets are simple function definitions with no operational code.\n- No code performs network requests, handles sensitive data, or manipulates data.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the functions as placeholders with no active behavior.\n- They reasonably assign malware scores of 0, given the lack of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The scores for malware (0) are appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the current inert state.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the functions are placeholders, there is no active risk. Scores above 0.5 would be unjustified unless future implementation introduces vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' assigned scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports mention the functions could be future vectors for malicious activity if later implemented, but currently, they are benign.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the current code state.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — No active security risk given the code's inert state.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as placeholder functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The scoring aligns with the current code state.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's current inactive, non-malicious nature.",
