  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox login via cookie or username/password, currently not implemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'. No other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points. No untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No actual code execution or data flow within the functions; they are empty stubs.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are unimplemented, which could indicate incomplete or placeholder code. No suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for authentication but does not perform any operations. There are no data manipulations, external calls, or security-sensitive actions. Lack of implementation means no malicious activity can be inferred. The code appears to be a template or scaffold, not active malicious code or supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no active behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious logic, or security risks. It appears to be an unfinished or stub implementation.",
