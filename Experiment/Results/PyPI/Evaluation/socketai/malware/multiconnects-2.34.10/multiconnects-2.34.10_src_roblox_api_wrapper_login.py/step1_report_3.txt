  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login procedures to the Roblox API, but currently non-functional.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'. No data reading beyond parameter passing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; functions are empty and do not perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing takes place within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two stub functions for login operations, accepting credentials and cookies but performing no actions. No data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The absence of implementation means there is no malicious activity or security risk demonstrated in this fragment. The code appears to be a skeleton or placeholder for future development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic placeholder with no active logic, security risks, or malware. It does not perform any malicious activity or insecure operations.",
