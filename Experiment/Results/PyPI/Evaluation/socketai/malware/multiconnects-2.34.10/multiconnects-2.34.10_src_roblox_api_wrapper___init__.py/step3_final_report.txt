{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, function parameters, or internal variables as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, subprocess calls, or environment modifications, but none are explicitly present or suspicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through internal functions to sinks such as network or file operations, none of which show evidence of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are observed; code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects a conservative baseline, acknowledging potential external interactions without evidence of malicious activity. Confidence is high (0.85) due to the clarity and simplicity of the code. No source-to-sink malicious flows are identified, and the absence of anomalies supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns based on the current analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
