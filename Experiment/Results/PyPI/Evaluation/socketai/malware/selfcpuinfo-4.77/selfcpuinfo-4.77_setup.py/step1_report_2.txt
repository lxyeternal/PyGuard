{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup script for a Python package called 'selfcpuinfo', possibly intended for distribution via PyPI. It includes an obfuscated subprocess call that may execute hidden commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem ('os.path.exists') to check for the existence of 'tahg'. It also imports and uses 'subprocess' to run external commands, and reads package metadata for setup.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call is a potential sink where untrusted or malicious commands could be executed if the code was altered. The command executed appears to be base64-encoded PowerShell commands, which is suspicious.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' and if not found, runs a hidden PowerShell command, then proceeds with package setup. The flow from filesystem check to subprocess execution indicates an attempt to execute concealed commands based on filesystem state.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess call uses an encoded PowerShell command with '-EncodedCommand', which is a common obfuscation technique. The URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' is commented out but suggests malicious intent or malicious hosting. The subprocess call is wrapped in a broad try-except, suppressing errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing 'setup' from distutils and attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It then checks if the file 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which is a suspicious behavior typically associated with malicious code execution or backdoor setup. The setup() function defines package metadata and is unlikely to be suspicious itself. However, the presence of obfuscated command execution indicates potential malicious intent. The try-except blocks suppress errors, preventing detection of failures or anomalies. The commented URL hints at malicious hosting or command-and-control servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily functions as a package setup but contains suspicious behavior involving obfuscated PowerShell command execution triggered based on filesystem state. This indicates possible malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or executing malicious code during package installation. The overall risk is elevated due to the obfuscation and hidden command execution.",
