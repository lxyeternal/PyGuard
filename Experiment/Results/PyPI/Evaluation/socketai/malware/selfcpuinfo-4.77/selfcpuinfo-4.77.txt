      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating probable malicious intent. The silent error handling and conditional execution increase the risk profile. The setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, and this package should be flagged for further investigation and deobfuscation of the payload."
