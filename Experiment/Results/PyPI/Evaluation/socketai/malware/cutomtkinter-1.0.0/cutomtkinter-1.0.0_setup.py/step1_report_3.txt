{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'cutomtkinter' with specific metadata and a custom installation command that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, executing code within the custom install class, reading environment variables (os.name).",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), import of potentially suspicious modules (requests, fernet), network operations via requests (implied by setup_requires), potential environment variable misuse.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, the code decrypts an embedded payload and executes it, potentially leading to malicious actions such as remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install class with obfuscated class name, encrypted payload within the code that is decrypted and executed, hardcoded encryption key, and encrypted payload indicating concealed malicious intent. The setup script loads potentially malicious code at install time.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom installation class that, upon execution on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is obfuscated, and the use of Fernet encryption suggests an attempt to conceal malicious code. The setup metadata contains nonsensical descriptions and author details, further raising suspicion. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only if the OS condition is met. The decrypted code could perform harmful operations, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, or establishing network connections, constituting a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script includes a hidden, encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution at install time are typical indicators of malicious behavior designed to conceal harmful actions. The package should be considered potentially malicious and avoided.",
