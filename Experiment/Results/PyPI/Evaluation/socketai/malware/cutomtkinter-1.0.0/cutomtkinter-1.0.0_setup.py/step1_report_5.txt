{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cutomtkinter', with a custom install command that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting data with Fernet, executing decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decrypted code as input, which could run malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "On Windows, during installation, the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it directly via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated/deceptive variable and class names, encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed, use of exec() with decrypted code, which is a common technique for executing malicious payloads. The setup script has a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, which are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, if run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is potentially malicious, as it allows executing arbitrary code at install time, which could be used to perform malicious actions such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors. The presence of obfuscated names and encrypted payload suggests an intent to conceal malicious activity. The code is designed to run only on Windows, indicating targeted behavior. The package setup includes minimal information, which is typical of malicious packages trying to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior pattern—decrypting and executing code during installation—indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The use of obfuscation and encrypted payloads further supports this conclusion. The package appears malicious and should not be used.",
