{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cutomtkinter' with custom installation behavior including decryption and execution of code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes embedded encrypted code via Fernet during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code (exec), potentially executing arbitrary code embedded in the encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "If on Windows (nt), the script decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. No other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated class name, variable names, and an encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time. Use of exec on decrypted data is highly suspicious. The long description contains random-looking text, possibly obfuscation or placeholder data.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, when run, checks for Windows OS. If true, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an embedded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it via exec. The code is heavily obfuscated via non-descriptive names, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution. This pattern is characteristic of malicious behavior, potentially executing arbitrary code during installation. No legitimate setup function or functionality appears evident beyond obfuscated code execution. The use of encryption and exec suggests an attempt to hide malicious code. The presence of setup_requires including 'fernet' and 'requests' might be normal dependencies, but combined with code execution, raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious, obfuscated behavior with encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, indicative of potential malicious intent. It likely executes arbitrary code embedded in the encrypted payload when installed on Windows systems.",
