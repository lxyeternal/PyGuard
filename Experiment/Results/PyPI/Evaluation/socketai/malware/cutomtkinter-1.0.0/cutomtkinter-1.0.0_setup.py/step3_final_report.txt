{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes arbitrary code during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded encrypted payloads and the OS environment (via os.name).",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks if OS is Windows, then imports modules, decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it, enabling potential malicious behavior during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded decryption keys, obfuscated class and variable names, and execution of decrypted code during setup are unusual and suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload indicate an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The high obfuscation, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified by these indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, involving encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution during setup. The pattern aligns with supply chain malware tactics. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
