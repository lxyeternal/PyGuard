  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, involving encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution during setup. The pattern aligns with supply chain malware tactics. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
