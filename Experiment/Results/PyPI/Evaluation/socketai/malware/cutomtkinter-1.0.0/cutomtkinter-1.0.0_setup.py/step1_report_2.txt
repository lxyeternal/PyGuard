{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'cutomtkinter' with an obfuscated install command that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing requests and fernet modules, and executing decrypted code via exec.",
  "sinks": "exec() call with decrypted code, which executes arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests & Fernet -> decrypt payload -> execute payload via exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; encrypted code executed during install; inclusion of hardcoded decryption key in the script; no clear purpose for the decrypted code; setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests' which are imported but not used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated installation command that, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes a hardcoded encrypted payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run hidden malicious code during package installation. The presence of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code are common indicators of malicious intent, potentially to install backdoors, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions. The code's purpose appears suspicious, especially given the encrypted execution and obfuscated class names. No other legitimate purpose for such behavior is evident in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated code, encrypted payload execution during installation, and hidden behaviors. It appears designed to run arbitrary code on Windows systems during package installation, which is a common tactic for supply chain attacks.",
