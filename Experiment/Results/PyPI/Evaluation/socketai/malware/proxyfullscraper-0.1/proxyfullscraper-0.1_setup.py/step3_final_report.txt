  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within the setup() call, including name, version, author, description, and package discovery via find_packages(). No external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder metadata such as author='you' and description='i love', indicating incomplete or default values but not malicious activity. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or code anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters, without any dynamic code, external input, or network activity. The metadata contains placeholder values, but these are benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a conclusion of no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with placeholder metadata. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
