  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data exfiltration tool with hardcoded credentials and silent operation. It does not contain active malware or obfuscation but has high potential for misuse, especially in unauthorized contexts. The behavior warrants a high security risk score and a malware score reflecting potential malicious use."
