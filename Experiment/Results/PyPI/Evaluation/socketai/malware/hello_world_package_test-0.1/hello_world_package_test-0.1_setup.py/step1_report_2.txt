  "purpose": "Custom installation process that reads environment variables and reports encoded content to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading the contents of '/proc/self/environ' to access environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via HTTP GET requests to an external server.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> Base64 encodes data -> Sends data in URL to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a try-except block with a fallback URL; encodes and transmits environment data during installation; hardcoded external domain; potential for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to perform additional actions during package installation. It reads the process environment variables from '/proc/self/environ', encodes the data in Base64, and sends it to an external URL. If reading fails, it makes a secondary request to a different URL. The external communication could be used for tracking or exfiltration. No malicious system damage or code execution is evident, but the collection and transmission of environment data without user consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be collecting environment data and transmitting it to a remote server during package installation, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration or tracking. While it does not perform destructive actions, this behavior is intrusive and potentially malicious.",
