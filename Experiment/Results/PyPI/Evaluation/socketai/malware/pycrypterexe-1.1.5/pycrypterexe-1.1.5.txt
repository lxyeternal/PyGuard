      "conclusion": "The code is a fully functional malware sample performing data theft, credential harvesting, remote control, and exfiltration. The main flaw is a bug in the cookie decryption method, which may limit cookie theft effectiveness. The malware and security risk scores are justified at maximum (1). The obfuscation score should be lowered to around 0.2–0.3, as the code is not heavily obfuscated but contains some complex functions. Overall, it is a high-threat malicious script with some implementation flaws that do not negate its malicious intent."
