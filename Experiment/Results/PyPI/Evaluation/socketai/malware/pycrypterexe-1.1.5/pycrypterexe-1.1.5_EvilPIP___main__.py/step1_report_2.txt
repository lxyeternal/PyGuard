{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information, stored passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and Wi-Fi passwords, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook. It also contains reverse shell capabilities for remote command execution.",
  "sources": "Data is read from various system files, browser databases, Wi-Fi profiles, and environment variables. Notably: system info, Wi-Fi profiles, Chrome passwords and cookies, Discord tokens, and potentially network commands via socket connection.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook and file uploads to gofile.io. Command execution occurs via socket-received commands, including potential reverse shell or tunneling commands.",
  "flows": "Sources include system files, environment variables, browser data, and network responses. Data flows into stored variables and files, then is uploaded to external servers or sent over network sockets. Network commands received are executed, with outputs sent back over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Discord webhook URL, IP and port configurations for reverse shell, the code directly executing system commands, and the ability to run network tunnels and a reverse shell. The script’s structure is obfuscated with dynamic imports and complex flows. It also includes modules to extract sensitive browser and Wi-Fi credentials, and to scrape Discord tokens.",
  "analysis": "The script is clearly malicious, designed for data theft and remote control. It collects sensitive information such as system details, Wi-Fi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens, then uploads or exfiltrates these via external services. It also provides reverse shell functionality, allowing remote command execution and tunneling, which could be used for persistent control. The presence of a hardcoded webhook and server IPs indicates a planned exfiltration infrastructure. The code’s complexity, inclusion of functions like Wi-Fi password extraction, Chrome password decryption, and cookie extraction, combined with network capabilities, strongly suggests malicious intent. The script’s design aligns with typical information-stealing malware, with additional remote access capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a spyware and remote access trojan. It steals sensitive user data, logs system info, and enables remote command execution. The combination of data exfiltration, credential theft, and remote control features confirms a high security threat. The hardcoded webhook and network commands make it highly suspicious for malicious use.",
