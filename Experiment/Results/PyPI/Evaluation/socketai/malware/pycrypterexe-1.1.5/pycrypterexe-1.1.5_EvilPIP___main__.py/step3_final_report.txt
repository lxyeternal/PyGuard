{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for malicious data exfiltration and system compromise, including collecting system info, passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and establishing a reverse shell for remote control.",
  "sources": "System commands (netsh), browser data directories, environment variables, network sockets, local files (Discord, Chrome, cookies), and user input via socket commands.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to web services (Gofile, Discord webhook), file uploads, and socket-based command execution for reverse shell activities.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system commands, browser storage, and environment variables; stored temporarily; then uploaded via HTTP or sent over socket connections. Commands received over socket trigger actions like tunneling or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, server IP, port, and reverse shell setup. Some complex functions for decrypting passwords and cookies, but with a bug in cookie decryption method (cipher.Decrypt() should be cipher.decrypt()).",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: extracting WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and system info; exfiltrating data via HTTP; establishing a reverse shell with socket communication; and attempting network tunneling. The decryption routines for Chrome passwords and cookies are implemented, but the cookie decryption contains a method call error that would prevent successful decryption. The reverse shell and tunneling features are basic but functional. The code is relatively straightforward, with some functions complex enough to suggest slight obfuscation, but not heavily obfuscated. The presence of hardcoded URLs, IP addresses, and tokens confirms malicious intent. Overall, the code is active, malicious, and poses a high security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a fully functional malware sample performing data theft, credential harvesting, remote control, and exfiltration. The main flaw is a bug in the cookie decryption method, which may limit cookie theft effectiveness. The malware and security risk scores are justified at maximum (1). The obfuscation score should be lowered to around 0.2–0.3, as the code is not heavily obfuscated but contains some complex functions. Overall, it is a high-threat malicious script with some implementation flaws that do not negate its malicious intent.",
