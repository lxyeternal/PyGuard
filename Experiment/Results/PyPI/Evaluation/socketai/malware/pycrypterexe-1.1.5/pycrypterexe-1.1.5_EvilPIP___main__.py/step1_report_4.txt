{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive system information, passwords, cookies, and tokens from the user's machine, upload these data to external servers, and optionally establish a reverse shell connection for remote command execution.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform, hostname, IP, MAC), WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, Chrome cookies, Discord tokens, and network commands via socket connection.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files containing passwords, cookies, tokens via HTTP POST; sends data to a Discord webhook; establishes reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port, allowing remote command execution.",
  "flows": "Sources of sensitive data (system info, passwords, tokens) are collected and written to files, which are then uploaded to external servers. Data from socket commands (reverse shell) are received and executed, with output sent back over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded webhook URL and server IP/port for reverse shell, which indicate intentional external communication. The code performs system data collection, password extraction, and reverse shell operations, all characteristic of malicious activity. Uses deprecated or insecure methods for decryption and interacts with system credentials in a suspicious manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules to collect system information and sensitive credentials, including WiFi passwords, Chrome saved passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens. It uploads this data to external servers (e.g., gofile.io, Discord webhook), indicating data exfiltration. The presence of reverse shell code that connects to a specified IP and port, with command execution and local tunnel setup, demonstrates remote control capability. Hardcoded external URLs, server IPs, and webhooks are typical indicators of malicious intent. The code does not perform any benign or necessary functions, solely focusing on harvesting and transmitting sensitive data, and establishing remote access, which confirms malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, designed for data theft, unauthorized access, and remote control of infected systems. It exfiltrates passwords, tokens, cookies, and system info, and includes reverse shell functionality with hardcoded communication channels. It is clearly intended for malicious purposes and poses significant security risks.",
