{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pycrypterexe' Python project.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as 'name', 'version', 'author', 'install_requires'. No external input or data sources are explicitly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs within this setup code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code defines package metadata and dependencies, not runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The dependencies are common, though some like 'requests' could be used maliciously if exploited, but their mere inclusion isn't suspicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. The dependencies listed are popular libraries, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors. The code structure and content are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears to be legitimate package configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. All observed elements are standard and non-malicious.",
