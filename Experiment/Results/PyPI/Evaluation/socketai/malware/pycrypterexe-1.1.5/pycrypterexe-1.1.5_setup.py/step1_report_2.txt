{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pycrypterexe'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package metadata, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The script primarily sets package metadata and dependencies without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script. It imports necessary functions from setuptools, specifies package metadata (name, version, author, description, URL, license, keywords, classifiers), and defines the packages and dependencies required for installation. All values are static strings or lists with no dynamic or external input handling. The dependencies include common packages, and there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform network connections, file manipulations, or other operations that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file for distributing a Python package.",
