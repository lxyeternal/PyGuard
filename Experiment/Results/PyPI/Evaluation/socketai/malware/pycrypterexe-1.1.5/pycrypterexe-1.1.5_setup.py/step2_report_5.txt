  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup.py configuration with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Dependencies are common, and there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. The description mentions 'Crypter FIle FUD' but the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with mention of 'FUD' possibly implying obfuscation or malicious intent, but no code evidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) due to mention of 'FUD' and network-related dependencies ('requests', 'sockets') which could be misused, but no actual malicious code is present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly cautious but justified; no actual malicious code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, with no suspicious code; dependencies may relate to cryptography, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malware in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; description mentions 'FUD' which could imply obfuscation, but no obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; only slight concern in some reports due to descriptive hints ('FUD') and dependencies that could be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Given the mentions of 'FUD' and network dependencies, a conservative but justified risk score would be around **0.2**. This reflects a slight concern due to the potential for misuse, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Critical notes:\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The description's mention of 'FUD' and cryptography could be used maliciously if the package contains obfuscated or malicious code, but this is outside the scope of the static setup script.\n- The dependencies are common but could be misused in malicious contexts if the package were to include malicious code elsewhere.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI recommend maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at **0**. The security risk score can be set at **0.2** to reflect cautious awareness of the description and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the static analysis and the evidence provided.",
