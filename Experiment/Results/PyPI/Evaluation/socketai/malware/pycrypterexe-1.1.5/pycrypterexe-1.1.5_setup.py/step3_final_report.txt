  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project, with no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or execute runtime logic.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script utilizing setuptools, with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The description mentioning 'FUD' and cryptography is only in metadata and does not reflect code behavior. Dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, with a slight elevation (0.2) in some reports due to descriptive hints, but no actual threat exists.",
  "conclusion": "The package is benign, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The static analysis confirms a very low security risk. The description's implications do not translate into code-level threats. Overall, the supply chain security posture is safe based on this code snippet.",
