{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation class that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), and imports modules such as os, requests, and fernet; it also reads the encrypted strings for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() function; potential network requests through 'requests' module; use of Fernet decryption key and encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "Imports and environment check → decryption of code → execution of decrypted code via exec() during install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names; execution of decrypted code within a custom install class; encrypted payload that is decrypted at runtime; inclusion of 'exec' on decrypted data which can be malicious; presence of potentially malicious string literals.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation command that, when run on Windows (nt), imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It then decrypts an encrypted string using Fernet and executes the resulting code via exec(), which could run arbitrary code. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, indicating an attempt to hide malicious or unwanted behavior. This pattern resembles obfuscated malicious code designed to run hidden payloads during installation. The package also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies. Overall, the code performs suspicious runtime code execution based on encrypted payload, which is a common tactic for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains potentially malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes hidden code during installation, which could be malicious. The obfuscation, use of encrypted payload, and dynamic code execution point to likely malicious intent, posing a significant security risk.",
