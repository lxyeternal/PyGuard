{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a hidden payload, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment info via os.name, and during install, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed directly via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: environment check and import statements; sink: exec() of decrypted code; flow: decrypts payload with hardcoded key and executes it during install on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payload and key embedded in code, execution only on Windows, use of exec() on decrypted data, and embedded decryption key.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, then conditionally decrypts a base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes it with exec(). The obfuscation and encrypted payload pattern are typical of malicious packages aiming to hide payloads. The use of exec() during installation, especially with embedded decryption keys, indicates high malicious intent. The pattern is consistent with known supply chain attacks involving malicious code delivery during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, including encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and dynamic execution during installation. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified. It should be treated as highly malicious until payload content is decrypted and verified.",
