  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, including encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and dynamic execution during installation. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9) are justified. It should be treated as highly malicious until payload content is decrypted and verified."
