      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which could facilitate remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high scores across reports are appropriate, and this package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms otherwise."
