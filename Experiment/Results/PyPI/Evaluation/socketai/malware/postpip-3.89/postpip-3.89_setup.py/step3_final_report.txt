{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory and, if absent, executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess during setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command, potentially downloading or executing remote code silently",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers execution of the encoded PowerShell command; command runs silently with no window, possibly downloading or executing malicious payloads",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks to suppress errors; execution of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command during package setup; silent, no-window execution flags",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg' and, if not found, runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command silently, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to conceal payloads. The command is obfuscated and executed without user awareness, indicating malicious intent. Error suppression further conceals potential issues. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks involving remote code execution or backdoors. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.8-0.9, obfuscated 0.8-0.9, security risk 0.8-0.9) are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which could facilitate remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high scores across reports are appropriate, and this package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms otherwise.",
