  "conclusion": "The package contains a high likelihood of malicious activity, with obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payloads executed conditionally, posing a serious security risk. The setup code itself is benign, but the embedded payload warrants suspicion and further analysis. The scores should be elevated to reflect the high threat level."
