  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to an external URL, potentially leaking user environment information.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source (get system info) to sink (HTTP request to external server).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a custom install class that exfiltrates system information without user consent or transparency, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. The URL used appears suspicious and may be used for data collection or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py installation process by adding a custom command that, upon installation, collects hostname, current directory, and username. These details are then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. This behavior is hidden within the installation process, potentially to collect user environment data covertly. The URL appears suspicious and is not a typical update or telemetry server; this indicates malicious intent or data exfiltration. The rest of the setup code is standard for packaging, but the inclusion of this network activity during install raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information during installation without user awareness. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and a significant security risk. The package should not be trusted due to potential privacy violations and data leakage.",
