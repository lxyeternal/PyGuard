  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'antchain_sdk_pcc' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is collected and transmitted over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during setup without user consent, and uses hardcoded URL. It leverages the setup process to send system info, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command in setuptools to execute additional code after standard installation. It gathers system details—hostname, current working directory, and username—and sends them to an external domain via a GET request. This behavior is unusual for a setup script and indicates potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration. The code does not perform any other malicious actions like file modification or reverse shell, but the data collection and exfiltration are concerning. The URL used is hardcoded, which is a typical trait of malicious or tracking scripts. Overall, the code appears to be designed to secretly gather system info during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user knowledge, indicating a supply chain attack vector. It is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
