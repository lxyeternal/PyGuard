  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior",
  "sources": "Imports requests, socket, getpass, os; reads hostname, current working directory, and username during installation",
  "sinks": "Requests.get sends data to an external server with system information",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system information and sends it to an external server without explicit user consent or notification, which is suspicious. The URL appears obfuscated or suspicious. No other malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon running, collects system hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL using requests.get. This behavior occurs during package installation, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The URL appears obfuscated, suggesting potential malicious intent. No other malicious behaviors like code injection, backdoors, or data theft are detected. The use of standard setup tools and libraries reduces suspicion but the data exfiltration behavior during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. It is a potential supply chain attack vector or privacy violation.",
