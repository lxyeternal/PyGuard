  "purpose": "Custom installation script for a Python package that collects system information during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from system environment variables and functions.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, cwd, username -> constructs request parameters -> sends data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Inserts code in the custom install class to exfiltrate system information without user consent, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. Uses a suspicious external domain. No validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. During package installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server. The request is unencrypted and lacks user consent prompts, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy violation. The domain used for exfiltration is suspicious, and the code does not appear to serve legitimate package functionality. It acts as a hidden backdoor for information collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information covertly during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It leverages standard setup tools for malicious purposes. No legitimate functionality is observed that justifies this behavior.",
