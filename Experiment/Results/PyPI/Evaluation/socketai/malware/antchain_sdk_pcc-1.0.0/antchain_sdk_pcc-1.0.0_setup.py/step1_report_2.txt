{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (requests.get).",
  "flows": "Collect hostname, cwd, and username; then transmit this data to the remote server over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a network request during the installation process, which is unusual for typical package setup scripts. The request is to a potentially suspicious domain and transmits system info without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setuptools installation process by adding a custom run method that gathers system info such as hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after installation, it sends this data to a remote server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. The request to a third-party domain without any user permission or disclosure is suspicious. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but the data transmission during install is an unusual and privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and transmit system information during package installation without user knowledge, which can be considered malicious behavior. While it does not directly perform harmful actions like system modification, this type of data collection is intrusive and potentially malicious.",
