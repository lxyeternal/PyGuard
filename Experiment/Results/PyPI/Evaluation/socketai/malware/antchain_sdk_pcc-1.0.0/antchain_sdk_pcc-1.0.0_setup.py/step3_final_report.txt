{
  "purpose": "The code performs a custom installation step that collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io)",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) pass data to requests.get() which sends data externally",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during setup without user consent; hardcoded suspicious URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly performs data collection and exfiltration during installation, which is abnormal for setup scripts. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The code is clear and un-obfuscated, with no other malicious behaviors. The exfiltration of environment info without user knowledge constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns or privacy-invasive practices. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the covert data exfiltration. The code does not perform destructive actions but raises high privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during installation, constituting a high security and privacy risk. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of approximately 0.9. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it represents a serious supply chain security concern.",
