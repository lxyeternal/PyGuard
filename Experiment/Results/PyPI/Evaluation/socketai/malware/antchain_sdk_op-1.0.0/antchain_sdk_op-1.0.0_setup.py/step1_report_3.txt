  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Imports (requests, socket, getpass, os); socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with collected system info as parameters",
  "flows": "On installation, system info (hostname, current directory, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional sending of system information to an external server during install; use of external network call in setup script; no validation or control over the request; the URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when invoked, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it makes an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL, passing this data as URL parameters. This occurs automatically during package installation, without any user consent or clear purpose. Such behavior resembles data exfiltration or a hidden backdoor, indicative of malicious activity. The URL appears suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes. No validation or error handling is present. The rest of the setup configuration is standard. This pattern is common in supply chain attacks to gather system info or establish contact with malicious servers during install.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by sending system information to an external server during package installation without user knowledge. This indicates potential supply chain abuse or backdoor functionality. The code is suspicious, likely malicious, and should be considered unsafe to use.",
