{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'antchain_sdk_op' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username (sources) flows into the requests.get call (sink) as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The requests.get call occurs during installation, sending potentially sensitive system info to an external domain without user consent. The URL is suspicious, and data collection during setup is unusual. No hardcoded credentials, but the behavior is malicious or at least privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setup process by adding a custom install class that, upon installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an outbound HTTP request transmitting this data to an external server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, which is suspicious, especially since it occurs during package installation. The URL used ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') is a known test domain often used in security research, indicating potential malicious intent or testing. No other malicious code, backdoors, or code injection is present. The activity is covert and privacy-invasive, typical of malicious supply chain attacks or data collection without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data collection of system info and sends it externally during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It can be used for tracking or exfiltration without user knowledge. Overall, it poses a significant privacy risk, indicative of malicious behavior.",
