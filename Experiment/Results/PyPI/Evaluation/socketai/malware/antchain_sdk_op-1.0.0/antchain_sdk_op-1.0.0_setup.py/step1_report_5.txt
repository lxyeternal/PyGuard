  "anomalies": "Sends system info (hostname, current directory, username) to external URL during installation, without user consent or obvious necessity.",
  "analysis": "The setup script customizes the install command to collect system information—hostname, current working directory, and username—and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is unusual for a typical setup script and indicates possible data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not use the data for installation purposes but rather to contact an external endpoint, which could be used maliciously for reconnaissance, tracking, or controlling infected systems. No other malicious code such as backdoors, code execution, or malicious payloads is present, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main purpose is to collect and send system information to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for reconnaissance or tracking without user consent, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy violations.",
