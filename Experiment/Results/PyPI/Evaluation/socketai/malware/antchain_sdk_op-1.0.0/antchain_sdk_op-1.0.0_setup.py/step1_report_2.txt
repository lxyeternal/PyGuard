  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Imports requests, socket, getpass, os; reads hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "Requests library sends data to external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, gathers hostname, cwd, username; sends data via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending system info during package install without user consent; hardcoded URL; no visible user prompt or consent; potential for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup process with a custom install class that, when executed, collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) and transmits it to an external server via a GET request. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious as it can be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user awareness. The URL used appears to be a controlled domain (ceye.io) often used for testing or malicious activity. There are no user prompts, logs, or safeguards; the code executes silently, indicating malicious intent or privacy invasion. No other malicious actions like code injection or backdoors are present, but this network activity during install is a serious privacy concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating a security risk. It likely aims to track or collect user data surreptitiously.",
