  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL in the run() method of CustomInstall; reading hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "Requests.get() sending collected data to an external server.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the CustomInstall.run() method executes, collecting system info and sending it via HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively transmits system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external domain without user consent or obvious reason. No input validation or user notification is present. The URL used is suspicious, resembling a command-and-control or data exfiltration server.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install command. During installation, it retrieves system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io'), which appears to be used for data collection or command-and-control purposes. The act of transmitting system info during package installation without user knowledge indicates potential malicious intent, akin to a supply chain attack or information leak. No other malicious behaviors like code injection, backdoors, or destructive actions are present. The URL used is suspicious and not related to the package’s intended functionality, indicating the code is being used for clandestine data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code maliciously collects system information during installation and exfiltrates it to an external server, constituting a malicious behavior likely aimed at user tracking or data theft. This behavior is hidden within the package setup process and not disclosed to users.",
