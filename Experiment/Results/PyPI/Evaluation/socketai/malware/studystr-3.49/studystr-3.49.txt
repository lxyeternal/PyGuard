      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of malicious or backdoor activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup. The use of silent, hidden execution and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting further investigation or rejection. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; the malware likelihood is high, and the overall security risk is significant."
