      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, indicating a significant security threat. The high scores assigned by the reports are appropriate, reflecting malicious intent and obfuscation. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm its exact behavior, but the current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious or compromised."
