{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'tpcvnvidiasuper' with some package details, but also includes potentially malicious activity in the form of hidden PowerShell commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system ('os.path.exists') and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell encoded command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a hidden PowerShell command which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading or executing remote payloads.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' directory, then executes a concealed PowerShell command via subprocess; the setup function is for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Base64-encoded PowerShell command that is run with 'shell=False' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', indicating an attempt to conceal execution. The code is also trying to run code before the setup process, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'distutils.core.setup'. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os', and conditionally runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely designed to perform remote or malicious actions without user awareness. Subsequently, it executes 'setup' to define package details, which appears legitimate. The combination of hidden execution and the encoded command suggests malicious intent or backdoor functionality embedded within otherwise normal setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains suspicious behavior in the form of executing a concealed PowerShell command, indicating potential malicious activity hidden within a package setup script. The setup portion seems legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious code execution. Confidence is high that this code aims to execute malicious commands upon package installation or script execution.",
