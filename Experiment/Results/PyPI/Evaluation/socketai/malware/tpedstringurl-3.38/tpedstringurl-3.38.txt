      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, indicative of malicious behavior. The setup code appears benign but is likely used as a delivery mechanism. The high scores assigned to malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified based on the evidence. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms specific malicious actions."
