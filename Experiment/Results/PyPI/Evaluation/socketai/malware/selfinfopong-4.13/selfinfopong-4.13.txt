      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded, obfuscated malicious PowerShell commands executed silently during setup, connecting to a suspicious external URL. The behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoors. The high scores across reports are justified, and the package should be considered malicious or compromised. Immediate removal or further analysis is recommended."
