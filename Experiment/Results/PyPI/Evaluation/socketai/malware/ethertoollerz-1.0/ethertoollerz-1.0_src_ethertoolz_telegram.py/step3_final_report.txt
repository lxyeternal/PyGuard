  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data by copying the 'tdata' directory, archiving it, and sending it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from the user's Telegram data directory ('\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata')",
  "sinks": "Uploads the zipped data file to an external webhook URL via HTTP POST request",
  "flows": "Code checks for data directory -> copies data -> creates archive -> sends archive to webhook",
  "anomalies": "Function 'telegram()' is defined but not called (commented out); broad exception handling suppresses errors; hardcoded webhook URL; no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, targeting sensitive user data for exfiltration. It contains no obfuscation and silent error handling, indicating stealth intent. The function's inactive state (commented out) means it won't execute unless invoked externally. The data collection and exfiltration logic are clear and malicious in purpose. The hardcoded webhook and silent failures suggest an intent for covert operation. The code's malicious potential exists regardless of current activation, as it is designed for data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally designed for malicious data exfiltration of Telegram session data. Although currently inactive, it could be activated easily, posing a significant privacy and security threat. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, and the malicious intent is clear.",
