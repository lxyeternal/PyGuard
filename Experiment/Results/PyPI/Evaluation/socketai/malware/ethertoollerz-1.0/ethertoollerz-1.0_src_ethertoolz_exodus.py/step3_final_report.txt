{
  "purpose": "The code searches for a specific user directory ('Exodus') in AppData\\Roaming, copies it to a temporary location, compresses it, and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, then attempts to delete the temporary files.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists() to check for the directory; shutil.copytree() to copy the directory; open() to read the ZIP file; requests.post() to send the file over the network.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending the ZIP file to an external webhook URL, potentially leaking user data.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check -> copy directory -> create ZIP archive -> open ZIP file -> send via requests.post() -> delete temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL; silent error handling with broad except clause; copying of potentially sensitive user data without user consent; no obfuscation; straightforward code with malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for a specific user directory, copies it, compresses it, and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded webhook, indicating malicious data theft. Error handling is minimal, which could hide failures but aligns with malicious stealth. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs clear exfiltration activity. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and silent operation strongly suggest malicious intent. The data exfiltration of user directories without user consent constitutes a high security risk. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious tricks are present, but the intent is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing silent exfiltration of user data via a hardcoded webhook. It lacks obfuscation but exhibits high-risk behavior, justifying a malware score close to 1 and a security risk score of 1. The behavior aligns with known malicious data theft scripts, and it should be flagged and mitigated accordingly.",
