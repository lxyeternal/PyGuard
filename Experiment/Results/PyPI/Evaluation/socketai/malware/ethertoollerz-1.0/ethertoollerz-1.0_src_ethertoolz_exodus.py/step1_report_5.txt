{
  "purpose": "The code searches for a specific directory in the user's AppData, copies its contents, compresses it, and sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory path, checks for the existence of the 'Exodus' directory, reads the contents of the directory, and opens the created ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Requests module sends data over the network to a Discord webhook URL; file operations access local system files; deletion of files after sending.",
  "flows": "Checks for directory -> copies directory -> creates archive -> opens archive -> sends archive over network -> deletes local copies.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting and exfiltrating potentially sensitive data without user consent, sending data to an external webhook, and copying entire directories which may contain private information.",
  "analysis": "The script identifies the user's home directory, looks for a specific 'Exodus' directory within AppData\\Roaming, and if found, copies its contents to a temp folder. It then compresses this data into a ZIP file, uploads the ZIP to a Discord webhook (potentially exfiltrating sensitive data), and cleans up the temporary files. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of a user-specific directory suggest malicious intent, particularly for data theft or unauthorized exfiltration. No suspicious obfuscation or code concealment is present; the code is straightforward but used for malicious data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates user data from a specific directory and sends it to an external server, indicating malicious behavior aimed at data theft. The overall structure is simple and direct, with no obfuscation but clear malicious intent. It is a security risk and should be considered potentially malware.",
