{
  "purpose": "To collect and send the contents of the user's Exodus folder to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the user's home directory, specifically the Exodus folder in AppData\\Roaming, and the zip file created from that folder.",
  "sinks": "The code uploads a zip file containing the Exodus folder contents via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the Exodus folder, copies it to a temp location, archives it as a zip file, then sends that zip via an HTTP request to the webhook URL, and finally deletes the local copies.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes a webhook URL, exfiltrates user data without user consent, and deletes local copies after exfiltration. The use of try-except without handling errors could hide issues. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for a specific folder within the user's AppData directory. If found, it copies the folder to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and uploads the archive to a remote webhook URL, which is hardcoded and likely controlled by an attacker. The code then attempts to clean up local copies. The flow indicates an intent to stealthily exfiltrate user data, consistent with malicious behavior. The hardcoded webhook and automatic data exfiltration without user consent raise suspicion. No obfuscated code or malicious tricks are evident beyond this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for malicious data exfiltration by uploading user folder contents to an external webhook. It is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
