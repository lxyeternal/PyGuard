  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing silent exfiltration of user data via a hardcoded webhook. It lacks obfuscation but exhibits high-risk behavior, justifying a malware score close to 1 and a security risk score of 1. The behavior aligns with known malicious data theft scripts, and it should be flagged and mitigated accordingly."
