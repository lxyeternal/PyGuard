{
  "purpose": "To collect and exfiltrate a specific directory (likely containing user data) to a remote server via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads user's home directory path, checks for existence of the Exodus directory, and reads the Exodus directory contents by copying and zipping it.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the zipped directory file via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Checks for Exodus directory -> copies it to temp -> archives the copy -> sends the archive over the network via webhook -> deletes temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; copying potentially sensitive user data; exfiltration of user data without consent; minimal error handling; uses broad exception to suppress errors.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies the user's home directory and looks for the Exodus directory within AppData\\Roaming. If found, it copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and sends it via a pre-defined Discord webhook. The script then attempts to delete the temporary files, ignoring errors. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the exfiltration of user data without user consent indicates malicious intent. No obfuscation is present; the code appears straightforward but malicious in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs unauthorized data exfiltration by collecting user-specific application data and sending it to a remote server. The use of a hardcoded webhook and the approach to covertly gather and transmit data suggest malicious behavior. It should be flagged for security review and removed from any environment.",
