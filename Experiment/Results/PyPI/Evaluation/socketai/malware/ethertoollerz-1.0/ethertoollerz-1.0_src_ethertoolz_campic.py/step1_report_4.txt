  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default webcam and save it as image.png.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) to access webcam; cap.read() to read frame data.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() saves the captured frame to disk.",
  "flows": "Video capture source -> frame data in memory -> saved to disk via cv2.imwrite().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward webcam capture and save operation with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam access, captures a single frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network communications, or obfuscated parts. It performs standard image capture operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code appears benign and intended for normal use.",
  "conclusion": "This script securely captures and saves an image from the webcam without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is a typical use of OpenCV for image capture.",
