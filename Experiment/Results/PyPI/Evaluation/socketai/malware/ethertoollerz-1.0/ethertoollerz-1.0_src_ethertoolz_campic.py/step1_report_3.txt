  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default camera device and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "Reading data from the camera device via cv2.VideoCapture(0).",
  "sinks": "Writing the captured frame to 'image.png'.",
  "flows": "Camera input (source) -> Capture frame -> Save image to file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard camera capture and image saving without any unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the webcam (device 0), captures a single frame, saves it as 'image.png', then releases resources and closes windows. It uses standard OpenCV functions with no user input handling, environment variable usage, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be a benign image capture routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward camera capture script with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions solely to take a single snapshot from the webcam.",
