  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default webcam and save it as a PNG file.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) - accesses the webcam; cap.read() - reads a frame from the webcam.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() - writes the captured frame to disk.",
  "flows": "VideoCapture(0) -> read() -> imwrite()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward webcam capture and save. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the webcam, captures a single frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. It uses standard OpenCV functions with no data leaks, environment variable misuse, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple webcam image capture utility with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
