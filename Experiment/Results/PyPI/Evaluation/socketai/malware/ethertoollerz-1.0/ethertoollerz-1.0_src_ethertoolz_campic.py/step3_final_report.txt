  "purpose": "Capture a single frame from the default webcam and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) to open webcam, cap.read() to get frame.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() to save image to disk.",
  "flows": "Webcam input (source) flows into frame variable, then to image file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward webcam capture and save; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam capture, reads one frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. It uses standard OpenCV functions with no suspicious patterns, external network activity, or credentials. The code is clear, simple, and benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign webcam snapshot utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and scores appropriate. No modifications needed.",
