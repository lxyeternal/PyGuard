{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration and session data, compress it into a ZIP file, and send it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "os.environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)'], os.listdir(), os.walk(), open files, requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() (sending data to webhook), writing files with steam_session.write(), removing temp files",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables and directory contents -> collecting specific files -> zipping files -> sending ZIP over network",
  "anomalies": "Collection of Steam config and 'ssfn' files without any user consent, sending potentially sensitive data over a webhook, lack of user notification or consent, no validation or encryption of data, hardcoded webhook URL",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the Steam directory and collects 'ssfn' files and configuration files, which are sensitive. It creates a ZIP archive of this data and posts it to an external Discord webhook, potentially exposing user credentials or session info. The code operates silently and does not provide any indication to the user, indicating malicious intent. The use of environment variables and file collection resembles typical data exfiltration tactics. There is no validation of data, no obfuscation, and the code is straightforward but malicious in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive Steam user data by collecting specific files and sending them to an external webhook, indicating malicious intent. It does not notify the user and operates covertly, representing a serious security risk.",
