{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration and session files, package them into a ZIP archive, and send this archive to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)', 'TEMP'), listing files in the Steam directory, reading Steam config files and ssfn files, opening and writing files to a ZIP archive, opening and reading the ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Sending the ZIP archive via HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook, deleting the ZIP file after upload.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> File system access (listing Steam files) -> Reading Steam config and ssfn files -> Creating ZIP archive -> Sending ZIP archive over network -> Deleting ZIP archive.",
  "anomalies": "The script collects potentially sensitive Steam session files and configuration files without user consent, packages them, and exfiltrates them to an external webhook. No user prompts or safeguards are present. The use of a webhook to transmit files indicates malicious intent, likely data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script first constructs the path to the Steam directory based on the 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)' environment variable. It searches for files starting with 'ssfn' (Steam session files), which are often used for authenticating users without passwords. It also attempts to zip Steam configuration files found in the 'config' directory. The function 'steam' recursively writes all files from the Steam config directory and the 'ssfn' files into a ZIP archive located in the temporary directory. After creating the ZIP, it uploads the archive to a Discord webhook URL, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration. The script then deletes the ZIP file locally, reducing evidence of its operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs suspicious data collection of Steam-related files and exfiltrates them via a Discord webhook. The behavior indicates potential malicious intent aimed at stealing user credentials or session tokens. There are no signs of benign functionality or user interaction; thus, the script is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
