{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration and session files, compresses them, and uploads them to a specified Discord webhook. This suggests an intent to exfiltrate user data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), os.listdir, os.walk, and file open calls to read Steam config files, ssfn files, and related directories.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to upload the compressed data to an external URL; file open and write operations for creating ZIP archive; file removal for cleanup.",
  "flows": "Reads Steam configuration and session files (sources) -> compresses files into ZIP archive -> uploads ZIP via HTTP POST request to webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, collection of Steam session files (ssfn), config files, and uploading them externally. The function 'steam' writes files without validation. The code's purpose aligns with data exfiltration. The code structure is minimal but manipulates sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the existence of Steam directory in Program Files, collects files starting with 'ssfn' and the 'config' directory, compresses these files into a ZIP archive stored in the TEMP directory, then sends this archive to a remote Discord webhook URL. It then attempts to delete the ZIP file. The code does not validate or sanitize files, directly exfiltrates potentially sensitive session files, and uses a hardcoded webhook, which is suspicious. The overall behavior strongly indicates malicious exfiltration of user data, specifically Steam session and configuration files. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward, although minimalistic. The actions align with malicious data theft behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Steam-related files by collecting, compressing, and uploading them to a remote server via a webhook. This behavior is consistent with malicious activity such as data theft or spyware. The presence of hardcoded webhook and collection of sensitive files without user consent indicates malicious intent.",
