{
  "purpose": "The code collects Steam configuration and SSFN files, compresses them, and uploads the archive to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PROGRAMFILES(X86), TEMP), directory listings in Steam folder, and Steam config files.",
  "sinks": "Uploads a ZIP file containing potentially sensitive Steam data via HTTP POST request to a webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Reads Steam files from the filesystem -> Compresses selected files into ZIP -> Sends ZIP via HTTP POST to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates potentially sensitive Steam configuration data without user consent. It directly uploads files to an external server. The code structure suggests it is designed for data theft.",
  "analysis": "The script first determines the Steam installation path and searches for 'ssfn' files, which are sensitive authentication files. It defines a function to walk through the Steam config directory and collect files, adding them to a ZIP archive. It then creates the ZIP archive of the config files and 'ssfn' files, and sends this archive to a Discord webhook URL. After uploading, it attempts to delete the ZIP file. The behavior indicates data exfiltration of user-specific Steam data, which could be malicious if done without user knowledge. The code's purpose aligns with stealing user credentials or session data from Steam, potentially for malicious use.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive Steam configuration files and session data by compressing and uploading them to an external server without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious data theft or malware. It does not appear to have legitimate benign intent.",
