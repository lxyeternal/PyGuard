  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert exfiltration of sensitive Steam files via a hardcoded webhook. It operates silently and without user consent, constituting a high security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. No obfuscation is present, and the activity warrants high concern."
