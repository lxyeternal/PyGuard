{
  "purpose": "The code collects Steam configuration and session files ('ssfn*'), compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the archive via a hardcoded Discord webhook without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)'), directory listing of Steam folder, reading files starting with 'ssfn', reading 'config' directory, file operations, and network request to webhook.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into ZIP archive, sending the ZIP file via HTTP POST request to external webhook, deleting the ZIP file after transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and directory contents as sources → collects specific files → compresses files into ZIP archive → sends ZIP via HTTP POST to webhook → deletes ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Silent operation without user notification, collection of sensitive Steam session and config files, use of hardcoded webhook URL, no encryption or obfuscation, immediate deletion of evidence.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the Steam directory, collects 'ssfn*' session files and 'config' directory, creates a ZIP archive in TEMP, exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook, and then deletes the archive. It operates silently, indicating malicious intent focused on data theft. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or validation, and uses standard libraries. The exfiltration of sensitive user data without consent is a serious security concern. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. The code's purpose is clearly malicious, designed for stealthy data theft, and the activity justifies high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert exfiltration of sensitive Steam files via a hardcoded webhook. It operates silently and without user consent, constituting a high security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. No obfuscation is present, and the activity warrants high concern.",
