{
  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot of the user's screen and send it to a specific Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\") for user directory, ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot, open() for reading the saved image, requests.post() for sending data to webhook",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending image data to the webhook URL, file removal via os.remove() after upload",
  "flows": "Screenshot captured via ImageGrab.grab() -> saved as file -> opened and uploaded via requests.post() -> file deleted",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, immediate screenshot capture without user consent, no validation or obfuscation, no error handling for request failure",
  "analysis": "The code captures a screenshot of the user's display using PIL's ImageGrab, saves it to a temporary location, and immediately uploads it to a Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating intent to exfiltrate visual data covertly. The process occurs without user interaction or notification, which is suspicious. The code then attempts to delete the temporary file, which suggests an effort to cover tracks. There are no checks for success or failure of the network request, nor any obfuscation or anti-analysis measures. The purpose aligns with data exfiltration, typical of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a screenshot logger that exfiltrates captured images to an external server via a webhook. It has clear malicious intent, primarily for spying or data theft, with no user consent or transparency.",
