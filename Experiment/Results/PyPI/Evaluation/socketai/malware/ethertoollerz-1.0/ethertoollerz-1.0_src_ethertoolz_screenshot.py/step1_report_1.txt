  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and upload it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser, ImageGrab.grab, open() for reading the saved image file",
  "sinks": "requests.post sending image file data to external URL",
  "flows": "Image is captured with ImageGrab.grab, saved to temp directory, then read and sent via requests.post to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; no input validation or encryption; direct screenshot capture without user consent; immediate deletion of the screenshot file after upload",
  "analysis": "The code captures a screenshot of the user's current display using PIL's ImageGrab, saves it to a temporary directory, then uploads this image to a specified Discord webhook via an HTTP POST request. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent to exfiltrate user screen data. The code deletes the screenshot after uploading to cover tracks. There are no user prompts, input validation, or obfuscation. The use of requests for network transmission combined with screen capture suggests malicious privacy invasion. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex constructs, but the behavior aligns with typical info-stealing malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a screen capturing and data exfiltration tool, likely intended for malicious surveillance. It captures user screen data without consent and transmits it to an external server. The hardcoded webhook and immediate cleanup support malicious intent. Overall, the code is suspicious and could be classified as malicious.",
