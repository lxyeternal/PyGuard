  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and upload it to a specified Discord webhook URL",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), ImageGrab.grab()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() with the screenshot file, os.remove() to delete the file",
  "flows": "capture screenshot -> save to temp directory -> upload to webhook -> delete screenshot file",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, immediate screenshot capture without user consent, no input validation, no encryption or obfuscation, no checks on the destination server",
  "analysis": "The code captures a full-screen screenshot without user interaction, saves it locally in the temp directory, and immediately uploads it to a specified Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potentially malicious intent to exfiltrate user screenshots. The code does not verify the destination, and there are no safeguards against misuse or detection. The deletion of the local screenshot file appears intended to cover tracks. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive visual data from the user system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a screenshot logger exfiltrating user images to an external server via Discord webhook. It operates stealthily and without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
