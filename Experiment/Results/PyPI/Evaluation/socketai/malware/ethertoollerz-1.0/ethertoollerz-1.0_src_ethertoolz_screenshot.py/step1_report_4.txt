  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and send it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser, os, ImageGrab.grab",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the webhook URL, file open/read for the screenshot, os.remove for cleanup",
  "flows": "Image captured by ImageGrab.grab → saved as ss.png → uploaded via requests.post → file deleted with os.remove",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, direct screenshot capture without user consent, immediate file deletion after upload",
  "analysis": "The code captures the user's screen using ImageGrab.grab(), saves it locally, then sends the image to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via a POST request. After sending, it attempts to delete the temporary image file. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and automatic screenshot capture without user interaction suggests potential malicious intent, such as spying or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious-looking code structures beyond the suspicious network activity. No other external dependencies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a screenshot logger that exfiltrates captured images to an external server. The hardcoded webhook and silent operation indicate malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The code is simple but suspicious due to its purpose and behavior.",
