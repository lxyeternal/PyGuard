{
  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot, exfiltrate it via a hardcoded Discord webhook, and delete the local file.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser, ImageGrab.grab, open() for reading the saved image",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the webhook URL with the image file",
  "flows": "Image is captured and saved locally -> file is opened and uploaded via POST request -> local file is deleted",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, immediate deletion of the screenshot file after upload, no user notification or consent, no error handling for network failures",
  "analysis": "The code captures a user’s screen, saves it temporarily, and exfiltrates it to a fixed external URL without user consent. The process is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the immediate cleanup suggests an attempt to hide activity. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating malicious intent. The code does not validate inputs or handle errors, but these are secondary concerns compared to its core malicious behavior. The exfiltration of user data without permission is a privacy violation and aligns with malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a stealthy data exfiltration tool, capturing and transmitting user screenshots covertly. Its behavior is malicious, justified by high malware and security risk scores. The straightforward implementation and lack of obfuscation confirm its malicious intent. It should be flagged as malware and removed from any source distribution.",
