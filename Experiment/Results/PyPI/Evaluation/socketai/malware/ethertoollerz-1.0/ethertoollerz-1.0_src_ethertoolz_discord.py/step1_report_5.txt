{
  "purpose": "The script searches various browser and application data directories for Discord tokens and other sensitive information, then exfiltrates the found tokens via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), file system (local storage files, logs, databases), and regex patterns searching for token formats within files.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage files, filtered for token-like strings, accumulated into a list, then sent via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects tokens from multiple sources and automatically exfiltrates them to an external webhook without user consent or indication. It targets sensitive directories, searches for tokens using regex patterns, and sends data externally. No input validation or user notification is present, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to locate and extract Discord tokens from various user directories and browser data. It constructs paths to multiple application data folders, searches for specific file types, and uses regex to find token-like strings. It then compiles these tokens and sends them to a remote webhook URL via an HTTP POST request, with no user consent or indication. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and the automated exfiltration of potentially sensitive tokens strongly suggests malicious intent. The script does not perform any benign function; instead, it acts as a token stealer and data exfiltrator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, acting as a token stealer that exfiltrates sensitive data to an external webhook. It exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including data collection from user directories and automatic sending of data without user approval. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence.",
