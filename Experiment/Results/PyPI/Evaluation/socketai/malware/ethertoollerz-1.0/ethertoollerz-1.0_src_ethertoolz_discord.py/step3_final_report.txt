{
  "purpose": "The script searches for Discord tokens in various local storage directories across multiple applications and browsers, extracts potential tokens using regex, and exfiltrates them via a hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), files in local storage directories (.log, .ldb, .sqlite) within specific application paths, reading lines from these files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a specified Discord webhook URL with the collected tokens embedded in a JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file system access → file reading and regex matching → collection of tokens → JSON payload creation → POST request to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, no validation or sanitization of extracted tokens, no user notification or consent, straightforward code without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activity by harvesting Discord tokens from user directories without consent and exfiltrating them to an attacker-controlled webhook. It searches multiple known locations for tokens, extracts them via regex, and sends them silently. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and directly implements credential theft. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL and lack of validation are typical indicators of malicious intent. The script's behavior aligns with common credential-stealing malware, with no signs of obfuscation or benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate Discord tokens from the user's system without consent. It exhibits clear malicious intent, with high potential for account hijacking and privacy violations. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 1, reflecting its high severity and threat level.",
