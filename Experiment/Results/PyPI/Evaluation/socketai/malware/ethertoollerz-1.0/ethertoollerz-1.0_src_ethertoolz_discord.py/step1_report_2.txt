{
  "purpose": "The script scans various browser and application data directories for potential Discord tokens and sends them to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), filesystem directories containing user data and logs, and the contents of log and database files within these directories.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to a webhook URL with the collected tokens embedded in a JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and filesystem paths -> scans files for token regex matches -> collects tokens -> sends data via HTTP POST request to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly searches for Discord tokens and other sensitive tokens, then exfiltrates these tokens to an external webhook. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and the intent to harvest tokens without user consent are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves environment variables pointing to user data directories across multiple browsers and applications. It searches these directories for log, database, and storage files, extracting strings that match Discord token patterns using regex. Found tokens are collected in a list, then sent to a remote webhook URL embedded within a JSON payload, which also contains static images and formatting meant for display. The purpose appears to be token theft. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity beyond data exfiltration is present. The code does not perform malicious system modifications or damage but is clearly designed for malicious data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent, designed to steal Discord tokens and exfiltrate them to an external server via webhook. It could be part of a malicious payload intended for account hijacking. The code does not contain obfuscation but performs a covert operation with clear malicious intent.",
