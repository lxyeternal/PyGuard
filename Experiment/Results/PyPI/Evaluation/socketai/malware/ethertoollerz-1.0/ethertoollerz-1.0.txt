It lacks obfuscation but exhibits high-risk behavior, justifying a malware score close to 1 and a security risk score of 1. The behavior aligns with known malicious data theft scripts, and it should be flagged and mitigated accordingly."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, serving as a covert data-stealing payload. Its structure, module choices, and function calls align with typical malware behavior aimed at harvesting sensitive user data for exfiltration. The broad exception handling and threading suggest an attempt to maximize data collection while avoiding detection. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is substantial."

Its behavior is malicious, justified by high malware and security risk scores. The straightforward implementation and lack of obfuscation confirm its malicious intent. It should be flagged as malware and removed from any source distribution."
