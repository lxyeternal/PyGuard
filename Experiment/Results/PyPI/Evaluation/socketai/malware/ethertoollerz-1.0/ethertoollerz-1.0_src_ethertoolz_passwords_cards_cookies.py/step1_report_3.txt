{
  "purpose": "The script collects sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and downloads from various browsers and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from browser data directories, Local State files, SQLite databases for logins, cookies, history, downloads, and credit cards, as well as environment variables and user directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL; writes data into local temp files and archives them into a ZIP file before exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser data files, environment variables) → Extraction and decryption functions → Saving data to temp files → Archiving temp files → Uploading ZIP archive via HTTP POST to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent, uses hardcoded webhook URL, copies database files without validation, and combines multiple data types into a single ZIP archive for exfiltration. It also collects a broad set of sensitive information, including passwords, cookies, credit cards, browsing history, and downloads.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a credential stealer and data exfiltration tool, targeting multiple browsers by accessing their local data stores. It decrypts passwords and cookies using Windows cryptographic functions and AES decryption, then saves all data into a temporary directory. It creates an archive of all collected data and sends it via a webhook, indicating malicious intent. The code does not obfuscate its purpose or data flow, and the presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, along with the broad scope of data collection, strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to harvest sensitive user data from browsers and exfiltrate it without user consent. It exhibits typical traits of malware like credential theft, data exfiltration, and privacy invasion. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
