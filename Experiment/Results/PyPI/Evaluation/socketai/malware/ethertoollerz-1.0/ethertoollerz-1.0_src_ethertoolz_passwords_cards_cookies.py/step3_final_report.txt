{
  "purpose": "The code extracts passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card information from various browsers, decrypts sensitive data, saves it into temporary files, archives these files into a ZIP, and exfiltrates the archive via a hardcoded Discord webhook, all without user consent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA), browser data directories, Local State files, SQLite databases (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, Downloads), and user input (though none explicitly in code).",
  "sinks": "Temporary files containing sensitive data, ZIP archive of all collected data, HTTP POST request sending the ZIP to the Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code reads browser data files and environment variables as sources, decrypts stored credentials and cookies, writes data into text files, compresses these files into a ZIP archive, and then sends the archive via an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL as the sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code operates stealthily without user notification, uses a hardcoded webhook URL for exfiltration, and deletes temporary files after processing. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically accesses multiple browser data stores, decrypts sensitive information using Windows cryptography functions, and consolidates this data into text files. It then archives all data into a ZIP file and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook. The process involves copying database files to temporary locations, decrypting encrypted fields, and cleaning up after itself. The code's behavior is consistent with malicious data theft, with no user consent or notification, and the data is sent externally without authorization. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, and employs standard libraries and Windows-specific cryptography, indicating malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious malware designed for stealthy collection and exfiltration of sensitive browser data, including passwords, cookies, history, downloads, and credit card info. It operates without user consent, exfiltrates data via a hardcoded webhook, and employs straightforward, non-obfuscated code. The malware and security risk scores are justified at 1, and the obfuscation score should be 0, reflecting the code's clarity and malicious purpose.",
