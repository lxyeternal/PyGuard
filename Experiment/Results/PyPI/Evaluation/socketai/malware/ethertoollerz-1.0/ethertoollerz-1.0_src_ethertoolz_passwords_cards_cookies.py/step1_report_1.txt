{
  "purpose": "The code extracts sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card information from various Chromium-based browsers and other supported browsers, then compresses and exfiltrates this data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA), browser data files (Local State, Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, downloads), and database queries retrieving URLs, credentials, and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Writing extracted data to local temporary files, creating zip archives, and POSTing the archive to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser data files, decrypted, aggregated into text files in temporary directories, compressed into a zip file, and then uploaded over the network via an HTTP POST request to the specified webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The script is designed explicitly for data theft and exfiltration, including access to encrypted passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card info, then transmitting this data remotely. The code contains no user interaction or consent prompts. Use of hardcoded webhook URL, direct file manipulation, and the absence of any user notification are suspicious. No obfuscation present but code performs malicious data harvesting.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules, including ones for cryptography, database access, and system interactions. It defines a webhook URL, and retrieves user environment variables for locating browser data. It contains functions to obtain master keys from local state files, decrypt stored passwords and cookies, and gather browsing data from browser SQLite databases. The functions make copies of databases, read data, decrypt sensitive info, and store results in temporary directories. In the main execution, the script detects available browsers, extracts data, saves files locally, archives them into a zip file, and then uploads this archive to a remote Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user data. The code's structure, direct file system access, and the purpose of data collection indicate malicious intent, specifically designed for stealthy data theft. There are no obfuscations or misleading variables; the code is straightforward but malicious in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious data-stealing malware targeting browser-stored credentials, cookies, history, downloads, and credit card info. It exfiltrates the collected data to an external server via a Discord webhook, which clearly indicates malicious intent. The script is intentionally designed for stealthy exfiltration of sensitive user data, with no user consent or notification, making it highly dangerous.",
