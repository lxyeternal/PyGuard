{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, cookies, browsing history, and downloads from various browsers on the system, and then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "File system paths to browser data directories, Local State files for decryption keys, SQLite databases for login, cookies, history, and downloads, environment variables for user directories, and the web request to send data.",
  "sinks": "Requests.post call sending the ZIP archive containing all extracted data to an external Discord webhook URL, file writing operations for saving extracted data, and removal of temp files after processing.",
  "flows": "The code gathers data from multiple sources (browser data directories, decrypted data from databases), saves results locally, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and then sends this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses and decrypts stored browser credentials, cookies, history, and payment data, then packages and transmits this information without user consent. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, temp directories, and obfuscated logic suggests malicious intent. The script also removes files after use to cover tracks.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining paths to various browsers' user data directories and functions to decrypt master keys and stored data such as passwords, credit cards, cookies, history, and downloads. It extracts and decrypts sensitive data, saves it in temp directories, then compresses everything into a ZIP file. Finally, it exfiltrates the archive to an external server via a webhook. The code operates stealthily, removing traces of its activity, and accesses sensitive data without any user interaction or permission prompts. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and the nature of the data collected strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a credential stealer and data exfiltrator targeting browser-stored sensitive data. It operates covertly, collecting extensive personal information and sending it to an external server without user consent, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
