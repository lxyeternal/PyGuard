{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with custom installation behavior, possibly to execute malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment (os.name), imports from requests and fernet modules, and executes decrypted code using exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts data with Fernet and executes it via exec(), establishing a source-to-sink flow that can run malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed during install, suspiciously long and nonsensical description strings, use of exec() with decrypted data, and dynamic package setup class name.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that installs a package named 'playwritgh'. The custom install command checks if the OS is Windows and then decrypts a payload with Fernet, executing it via exec(). The decrypted payload could be malicious, especially given the use of exec() on data obtained at runtime. The code uses encrypted data, which is often a tactic to hide malicious intent. The presence of a hardcoded Fernet key and execution during installation on Windows constitute serious security concerns. The package setup metadata appears normal, but the malicious activity is embedded in the custom install class. The overall behavior strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at executing arbitrary code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload executed during Windows installation, using encrypted data and exec(), which indicates high malicious potential. The package appears designed to run arbitrary code covertly, posing significant security risks.",
