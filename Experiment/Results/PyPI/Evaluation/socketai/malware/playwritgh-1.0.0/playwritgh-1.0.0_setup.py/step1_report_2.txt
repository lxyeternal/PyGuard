{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command which executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and executes a decrypted script during the install command execution.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted code is executed via exec() during installation, which is a potential sink for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the custom install command, which decrypts and executes embedded code at runtime during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated custom install command that decrypts and executes code via Fernet and exec(). The long description appears random, indicating possible obfuscation or data hiding. Usage of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload suggests malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom installation class. Within the custom run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded key, and executes it dynamically via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code during installation is a common technique for embedding malicious payloads or backdoors. The code is intentionally obfuscated, with meaningless long description and a convoluted class name. The presence of hardcoded secrets and dynamic code execution during setup is a security concern. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', but these are standard packages; their inclusion does not raise immediate suspicion. Overall, the primary concern is the decrypted code executed during install, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a highly suspicious custom install command that decrypts and executes code during package installation, indicating potential malicious intent. The obfuscation and use of hardcoded cryptographic secrets suggest the package may include a backdoor or malicious payload. It should not be trusted without further inspection of the decrypted code.",
