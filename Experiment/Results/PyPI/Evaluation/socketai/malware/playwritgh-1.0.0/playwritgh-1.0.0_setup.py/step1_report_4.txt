  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs installation and includes a custom install command.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules (os, requests, fernet), decrypting data, and executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, network requests via requests module, and reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt data with Fernet -> execute decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data being decrypted and executed dynamically; obfuscated variable and class names; unusual description content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process with a custom install command class that, upon execution, checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an embedded encrypted string with Fernet and executes the resulting code. The encrypted data and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as loading and executing remote or embedded code at install time, which is suspicious. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical but is overshadowed by this malicious behavior. The code could potentially perform malicious actions during installation, such as connecting to external servers or executing harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior involving decrypting and executing code during installation, which can be used to perform unauthorized actions on the target system. The presence of obfuscated class and variable names and dynamic code execution indicates high malicious potential.",
