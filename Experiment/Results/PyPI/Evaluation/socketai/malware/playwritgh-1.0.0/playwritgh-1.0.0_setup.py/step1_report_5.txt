{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that includes decrypting and executing hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded encrypted strings within the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network requests potentially made through imported requests library, and use of Fernet decryption keys.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts encrypted data with Fernet and executes it via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution. It also imports requests, which could be used to connect to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted strings used for code execution, and the use of exec() with decrypted code. The long description appears random and meaningless. The custom install class performs a suspicious decrypt-and-execute sequence. setup_requires includes 'fernet', which is unusual as a setup dependency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with deliberately obfuscated class and variable names. The custom 'install' class overrides the run method to decrypt and execute code at install time, which is a common tactic for hidden malicious payloads. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, and the use of exec() to run decrypted code can lead to arbitrary code execution. The import of requests and fernet modules indicates potential for network activity or further malicious actions. The long description string appears meaningless and serves as a decoy. The overall structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains clear signs of malicious behavior, including deobfuscation and execution of encrypted code during installation, which could be used for arbitrary malicious activities. The obfuscation and encrypted payload indicate malicious intent and concealment of malicious code execution upon installation. The package should be considered highly suspicious and dangerous.",
