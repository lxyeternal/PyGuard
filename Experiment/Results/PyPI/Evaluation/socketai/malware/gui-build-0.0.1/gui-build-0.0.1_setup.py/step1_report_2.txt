{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily intended to facilitate package installation and development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and during execution, it fetches a remote file via an HTTP GET request from a suspicious URL and executes it.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is saved as 'Cleaner.exe' and then executed with 'os.system', which could run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "flows": "Input from the network (URL) flows into writing a binary file ('Cleaner.exe'), which then flows into execution via 'os.system', creating a potential malicious code execution path.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it silently during package installation or development setup, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The URL looks suspicious and is not related to the package's description or repository.",
  "analysis": "The script contains standard setup logic but also includes a function 'execute()' that fetches an external executable from an external URL and runs it without any validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, aiming to execute arbitrary code during installation. The usage of 'os.system' to run the downloaded executable indicates malicious intent, potentially installing backdoors or malware. The code does not sanitize or verify the downloaded file, increasing risk. The rest of the code is typical for a setup script, but the inclusion of remote code execution is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during installation, posing a significant security risk. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package designed to compromise systems upon installation.",
