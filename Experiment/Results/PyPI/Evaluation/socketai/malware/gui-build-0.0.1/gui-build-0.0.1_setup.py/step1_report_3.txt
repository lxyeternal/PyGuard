{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation or development setup, downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL within the 'execute' function, requests.get call to download an external file, and os.system call to execute the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' response content is written directly to 'Cleaner.exe', which is then executed via os.system without validation or sandboxing.",
  "flows": "The code downloads an external executable (source) and immediately runs it (sink) during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading and executing an external binary during setup, which is highly suspicious and not typical for package installation scripts. The executable URL appears to be a custom, non-standard address. Use of os.system to run an external file with minimal checks is concerning.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools for packaging. It defines a function 'execute' that downloads an executable from a specified URL and runs it. This function is invoked during the 'run' method of both custom 'develop' and 'install' commands, meaning it executes during package installation or development setup. The URL points to a .exe file hosted on a suspicious domain, and the code directly executes this downloaded file via 'os.system' with no validation or sandboxing. This behavior is typical of malicious supply chain tactics, aiming to run arbitrary code on the target system. No other benign functionality or security checks are present. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors associated with malicious activity, notably the hidden download and execution of a binary during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable during package installation or development, which can lead to remote code execution on the target system. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks.",
