{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also downloads and executes an external executable file during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL for the executable and calls requests.get() to download it; it also reads package metadata files like README.md.",
  "sinks": "The response content is written directly to 'Cleaner.exe' and executed via os.system().",
  "flows": "URL response -> open('Cleaner.exe') -> os.system('set ... | start Cleaner.exe')",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The URL is obfuscated or non-standard and points to a suspicious domain. The use of 'os.system' to run a downloaded executable without validation is a significant red flag.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but also includes a function 'execute' that downloads an executable from a remote URL and runs it immediately after installation or development setup. This behavior is unusual and suspicious in a Python package, especially because it executes an external file without any validation or user consent. The URL appears obfuscated or non-standard, suggesting potential malicious intent. The process of writing and executing 'Cleaner.exe' can be used for malware delivery or system compromise. No other malicious or suspicious code is present beyond this behavior. The use of 'requests' to fetch a binary and the direct execution of it indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to download and execute a remote executable during package setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It likely aims to infect the host system with malware or establish unauthorized control. The code should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
