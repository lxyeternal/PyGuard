{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package, potentially for GUI development, but also includes code that downloads and executes an external executable, which could be malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also performs a GET request to a remote URL to download an executable.",
  "sinks": "Downloaded executable ('Cleaner.exe') is written to disk and then executed via os.system with environment variable manipulation.",
  "flows": "Code reads local files (README.md), then makes an HTTP request to fetch an executable, writes it to disk, and executes it using os.system. The flow from remote URL to execution is suspicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an external executable from an obscure URL and runs it silently during setup commands. Use of os.system to run an executable without validation is suspicious. The URL appears to be a random or obfuscated domain, possibly malicious. Environment variable '__COMPACT_LAYER' is set to 'RunAsInvoker', which might be used for privilege escalation or stealth.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but includes a critical malicious activity: downloading and executing a remote binary during installation or development. The URL is not related to the package purpose and appears malicious. The use of os.system for executing the downloaded file is risky and indicates malicious intent. There is no validation or verification of the downloaded executable. The rest of the code is typical for setup scripts, but the embedded malicious activity is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing an external binary during setup, which is a supply chain attack vector. The presence of remote code execution in the setup process indicates high malicious intent.",
