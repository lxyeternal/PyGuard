{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes a remote executable during setup, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call fetching 'https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe' and open/write to 'Cleaner.exe'.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing 'Cleaner.exe' after download.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the executable -> file is written to disk -> os.system() runs the executable.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing an external binary during package setup without validation; URL is suspicious; no validation or sandboxing performed.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly downloads a binary from a suspicious URL during setup commands ('develop' and 'install') and executes it directly via os.system(). This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, such as malware delivery or remote code execution. The URL appears obfuscated or non-standard, and the code lacks validation or sandboxing, increasing risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics. The malware score should be set to 1, security risk to 1, obfuscated to 0, and confidence high (around 0.95).",
  "conclusion": "The code contains explicit malicious behavior—downloading and executing remote code during package installation—making it highly malicious and dangerous. The scores should reflect maximum threat levels.",
