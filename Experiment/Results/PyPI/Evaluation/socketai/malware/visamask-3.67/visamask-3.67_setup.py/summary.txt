  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the silent, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup. The setup code appears benign, but the embedded behavior is a security concern. The high scores across reports are justified, reflecting the obfuscation and covert execution. Until the encoded command is decoded and verified, the package should be considered potentially malicious."
