      "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload execution triggered during setup, with external URL references and stealth techniques. All evidence points to malicious or maliciously intended behavior. The scores are consistent with these findings, and the overall security risk is high. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
