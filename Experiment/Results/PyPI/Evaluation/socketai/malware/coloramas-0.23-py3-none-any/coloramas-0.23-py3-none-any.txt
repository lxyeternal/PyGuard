      "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of malicious exfiltration malware targeting Exodus wallet users. It covertly collects sensitive wallet files and system info, then transmits them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account using hardcoded credentials. The script operates stealthily, with no user consent, and poses a high security threat. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 1, reflecting its malicious intent and high severity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for terminal styling, with potential concern over the local module's name and import style. No evidence of malicious activity is present; scores are appropriate. The main security consideration is verifying the local module's integrity."
