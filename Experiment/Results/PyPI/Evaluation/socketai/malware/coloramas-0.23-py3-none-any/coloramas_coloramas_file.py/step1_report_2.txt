  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive wallet files and information related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from a user's system and exfiltrate this data to a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, user directory paths, and wallet-related files (exodus.conf.json, info.seco, seed.seco, passphrase.json, storage.seco, twofactor.seco, twofactor-secret.seco, and wallet files on Desktop, Downloads, Documents). Also makes HTTP requests to get IP and country info.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected wallet files and system info via Telegram bot API using requests.post with files and message data.",
  "flows": "Sources (wallet files and system info) are written into a zip archive. The zip file is then read and sent via Telegram API as a document, along with a message containing system IP, country, and a custom message.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collecting and exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and system info without user consent; constructing messages with system IP and country info; unnecessary exception handling that masks errors; use of environment variables and file paths suggest targeting specific wallet data.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet, packages it into a zip archive, and exfiltrates it via a Telegram bot. It also collects and includes system IP and country info in the message. Hardcoded credentials (TOKEN, chat_id) indicate malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, especially since the data is collected without user knowledge. The code uses multiple try-except blocks to silently handle errors during file operations, which could hide issues or failures in data collection. The code is straightforward and does not obfuscate its logic, but the purpose is clearly to stealthily exfiltrate wallet and system data to an attacker-controlled Telegram account.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to steal sensitive wallet and system information, package it covertly, and send it to an external entity via Telegram. It does not perform any benign or legitimate function; instead, it exhibits clear malicious behavior aimed at data theft and exfiltration.",
