{
  "purpose": "The code collects specific wallet-related files and system information from the user's directories, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram API to an attacker-controlled account.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), wallet configuration files (exodus.conf.json, seed.seco, passphrase.json, info.seco, etc.), user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), external IP and geolocation via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into a ZIP archive, sending messages and documents via Telegram API endpoints (requests.post), deleting the ZIP archive after transmission.",
  "flows": "Sources (wallet files, system info) are collected and written into a ZIP archive; the IP and country info are fetched and appended to the message; the ZIP file and message are sent via Telegram API; finally, the ZIP file is deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, silent exception handling which masks errors, no user notification or consent, straightforward code without obfuscation, covert data collection and exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script targets specific wallet files and system info, packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. It uses hardcoded credentials, silently handles errors, and operates without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs covert data theft. External IP and geolocation are fetched to possibly aid in targeted attacks. The use of requests to send data and files, combined with the collection of sensitive wallet data, confirms malicious behavior. The exception handling masks errors, but does not negate the malicious purpose. The overall behavior aligns with typical malware designed for data theft and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of malicious exfiltration malware targeting Exodus wallet users. It covertly collects sensitive wallet files and system info, then transmits them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account using hardcoded credentials. The script operates stealthily, with no user consent, and poses a high security threat. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 1, reflecting its malicious intent and high severity.",
