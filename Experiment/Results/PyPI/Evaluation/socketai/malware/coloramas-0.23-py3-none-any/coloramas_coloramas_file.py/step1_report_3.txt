{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect sensitive wallet data and files related to Exodus wallet, compresses them, and sends them to a remote Telegram bot, potentially for theft or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, filesystem paths for wallet and config files, HTTP requests to obtain IP and country info, and reading files to include in a ZIP archive.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages and files via Telegram API with bot token and chat ID, HTTP GET requests to IP API, and file writing/removal operations.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from filesystem and environment variables, sensitive files are added to ZIP, then the ZIP is sent via Telegram, along with IP and country info obtained through HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of wallet and configuration files without user consent, sending potentially sensitive data to an external server, use of exception handling that suppresses errors, and concatenation of messages with sensitive information. The code does not perform any validation or user interaction, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user-specific files related to Exodus wallet, including sensitive config, seed, passphrase, and other wallet data, then archives and exfiltrates them via Telegram API. It also fetches IP and country info, appends it to the message, and sends it alongside the files. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not include any user prompts or safeguards, and the purpose aligns with data theft. No obfuscation or typical malware code patterns are present beyond the intent to exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a wallet data exfiltration tool, collecting sensitive wallet files, and transmitting them to an external server (Telegram). It appears malicious due to its intent to steal user data without consent, using hardcoded credentials and covert data collection methods. No malware or obfuscation techniques are present, but the overall purpose is malicious.",
