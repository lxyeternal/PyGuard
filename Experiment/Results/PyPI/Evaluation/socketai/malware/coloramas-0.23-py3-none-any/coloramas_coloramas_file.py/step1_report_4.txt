  "purpose": "The script appears to collect specific files related to Exodus wallet (such as configuration, seed, passphrase, and other wallet data) from user directories, compress them into a ZIP file, and then send the ZIP file and a message with IP and country information via Telegram. Its purpose seems to be data exfiltration of sensitive wallet information.",
  "sources": "User directories (appdata, desktop, downloads, documents) when certain Exodus wallet files exist; network requests to external IP geolocation service and Telegram API; environment variables for paths.",
  "sinks": "Sending a ZIP file and a message via Telegram API endpoints (sendMessage and sendDocument). Reading sensitive wallet files and environment variables; network requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "Code checks for wallet files → if found, zips sensitive files → retrieves external IP and country code → constructs a message with user info and geolocation → sends message and ZIP file via Telegram → deletes ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of wallet files from user directories without user consent; dynamic construction of messages with geolocation; potential credential or wallet data exfiltration. No user prompts or notifications. Use of try-except blocks that silently pass exceptions, hiding errors. The code appears to be designed to run stealthily.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing modules and defining an 'initialize' function. It retrieves the current username, sets a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, and constructs paths to various wallet-related files in the user directories. It checks for the existence of certain wallet files; if found, it creates a ZIP archive and attempts to add these files to it, catching and ignoring exceptions. It also reads specific wallet configuration files. If files are added, it appends status messages. Then, it fetches the external IP address and country code via HTTP requests to ip-api.com. It converts the country code into flag emojis. It sends a message with user info, IP, and country to a Telegram chat, and then uploads the ZIP containing sensitive wallet data. Finally, it attempts to delete the ZIP file. The use of hardcoded tokens, access to user wallet data, and network activity for data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. No user notification or consent mechanisms are present. The code is structured to run stealthily and could be part of malware or a supply chain attack targeting Exodus wallet users.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious data stealer targeting Exodus wallet users. It secretly collects sensitive wallet files, gathers geolocation data, and exfiltrates this information via Telegram. The use of hardcoded credentials, access to sensitive files, and silent network communication indicate malicious intent with high security risk. The overall design suggests the code is intended to operate covertly, making it malicious.",
