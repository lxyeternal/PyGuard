  "conclusion": "The code is a clear example of malicious exfiltration malware targeting Exodus wallet users. It covertly collects sensitive wallet files and system info, then transmits them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account using hardcoded credentials. The script operates stealthily, with no user consent, and poses a high security threat. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 1, reflecting its malicious intent and high severity."
