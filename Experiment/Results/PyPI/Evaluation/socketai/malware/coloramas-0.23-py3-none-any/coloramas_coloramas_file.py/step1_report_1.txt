{
  "purpose": "This script collects specific user files related to Exodus wallet, compresses them, and sends the archive and system IP information to a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, filesystem paths to wallet files, external IP address via requests.get, Telegram API endpoints",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API (sending messages and documents), file write operations, and deletion of files",
  "flows": "User data (files) are added to a ZIP archive, which is then sent over Telegram; external IP info and country code are fetched and included in the message",
  "anomalies": "Code is designed to collect sensitive wallet files without user consent, send them externally, and obfuscate the user's IP and location information; hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which could be malicious or unauthorized",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive wallet files from specific directories, packages them into a ZIP archive, and uploads them to a Telegram bot. It also retrieves external IP address and country code to include in the message, which indicates tracking of user location. The presence of hardcoded credentials (Telegram bot token and chat ID), and the automatic exfiltration of wallet data suggest malicious intent. The code does not appear to validate or sanitize any data; it solely focuses on collecting and transmitting user information. Its structure is straightforward but designed to operate covertly, with minimal error handling, indicating a potentially malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script acts as a malicious exfiltration tool, collecting sensitive user files and system information, then transmitting them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. The hardcoded credentials, user data collection, and external data transmission strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
