  "purpose": "Setup for terminal styling using the colorama library and a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module 'coloramas_file' and external 'colorama'; call to initialize().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import from local module and external library, then call to initialize() setting up terminal styling.",
  "anomalies": "Wildcard imports obscure imported symbols; local module 'coloramas_file' has a suspicious name similar to 'colorama'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign setup for terminal styling with no evidence of malicious activity. Wildcard imports are stylistically discouraged but not malicious. The local module's name suggests potential shadowing or malicious intent, but without inspecting its content, this remains speculative. Malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Risk score is slightly elevated (0.2) due to the suspicious filename and import style, which is justified. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants verification of 'coloramas_file' content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for terminal styling, with potential concern over the local module's name and import style. No evidence of malicious activity is present; scores are appropriate. The main security consideration is verifying the local module's integrity.",
