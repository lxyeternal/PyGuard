  "purpose": "Analyze the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network activity, dynamic code execution, file access, and potential external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, and data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources flows into processing functions, with potential malicious payloads executing or transmitting data at sinks, especially via network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual imports, or functions that perform suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code's benign reports (1, 2, 4, 5) show no suspicious patterns, with scores reflecting low malware and obfuscation. Report 3 indicates obfuscation and network activity, justifying higher scores (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.65). The scores are consistent with the described features. No evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage was found in the static analysis. The high suspicion in report 3 warrants further dynamic analysis, but based on current static signals, the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; report 3 shows signs of obfuscation and network activity, justifying elevated suspicion. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no immediate malicious behavior is confirmed. Further dynamic testing is recommended for report 3 to confirm malicious intent.",
