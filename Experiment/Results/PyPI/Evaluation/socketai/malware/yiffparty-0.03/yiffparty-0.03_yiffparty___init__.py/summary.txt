  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,

  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks; report 3 shows signs of obfuscation and network activity, justifying elevated suspicion. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no immediate malicious behavior is confirmed. Further dynamic testing is recommended for report 3 to confirm malicious intent."
