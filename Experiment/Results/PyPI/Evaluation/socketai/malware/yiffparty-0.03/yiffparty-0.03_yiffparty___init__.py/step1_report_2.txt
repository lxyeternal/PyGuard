  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific computational task, likely related to data processing or utility functions, without clear indicators of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, external modules, or possibly environment variables (if used).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file I/O, subprocess execution, or data storage mechanisms where untrusted data might be sent or stored.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input variables, environment variables, or external modules) to sinks through functions or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or backdoor code detected. No unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors identified. No external communications or code injection points apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python, with typical function definitions and logic flows. No signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The use of third-party libraries, if any, seems legitimate and contextually appropriate. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or unauthorized network activity detected. The code structure is clear and typical of legitimate scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be benign, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
