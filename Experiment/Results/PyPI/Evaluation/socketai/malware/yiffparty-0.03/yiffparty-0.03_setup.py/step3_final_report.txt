  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing the package 'yiffparty'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description; defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs processed within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content; sets package info; dependencies are declared but not executed.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious or unprofessional URL ('http://lolurmomis.gay') and email ('dontfuckingbother@emailisfake.net'), but these are metadata issues, not code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It only reads a static README file and sets package metadata. Dependencies are standard and benign. No hardcoded secrets or code injection points are present. The suspicious URL and email are likely joke or unprofessional entries, not indicators of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting metadata concerns but no technical vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main concern is the unprofessional contact info and URL, which do not pose security risks but may warrant trust considerations. Overall, the code is safe.",
