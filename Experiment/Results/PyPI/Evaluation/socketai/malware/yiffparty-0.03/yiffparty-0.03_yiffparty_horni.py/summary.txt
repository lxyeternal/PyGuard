  "conclusion": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation through eval() on decoded strings, which could execute malicious code. Syntax errors and nonsensical variable names suggest obfuscation or tampering. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the package should be treated as high risk until thoroughly analyzed and deobfuscated."
