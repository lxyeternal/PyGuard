  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign in its setup function but contains embedded malicious activity through an obfuscated PowerShell command that downloads and executes external payloads. The external URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, making this package potentially part of a supply chain attack. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the code should be treated as malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms its behavior."
