      "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup with a suspicious, obfuscated, stealthy payload execution triggered conditionally. The obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting further analysis of the encoded command. The current scores are justified given the observed behavior, but decoding the payload is recommended for definitive assessment."
