      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, malicious payload that executes silently during installation, connecting to an external server. The obfuscation, conditional execution, and concealment techniques strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and the package should be flagged, removed, or thoroughly analyzed before use."
