{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'tensogflow' with specific metadata and a custom installation behavior that executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), imports modules, and executes code inside the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function inside the run() method executes decrypted code that is fetched from a Fernet-encrypted string, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via exec(), which is a sink for malicious code. The flow is: import -> check OS -> decrypt -> execute.",
  "anomalies": "The run() method contains encrypted payload using Fernet, which upon decryption runs code without any transparency or validation. The code uses dynamic execution (exec) with decrypted data, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup script but contains a suspicious custom install class that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and dynamic execution indicate an attempt to hide malicious code. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious behavior. The encrypted code could perform malicious actions such as connecting to remote servers, installing backdoors, or executing arbitrary commands, though the exact payload is hidden. The use of cryptography to obfuscate code and the conditional execution on Windows suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious component: decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to run malicious code on user systems transparently. The rest of the setup appears benign, but the presence of encrypted, executable payload makes this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
