  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tensogflow' that installs dependencies and potentially executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method within the custom 'install' class, which is executed during installation. Specifically, the 'exec' function that executes decrypted code. Imports of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules within that method.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function running decrypted code potentially from remote or embedded sources, which could lead to code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The script imports and decrypts data with Fernet, then executes it via 'exec'. This decrypted code runs during installation if on Windows ('nt'). The code potentially executes malicious payloads from the embedded encrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a long, seemingly random encrypted string executed via 'exec' during setup. The class name is obfuscated. The decrypted payload is not visible, indicating potential obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent. Decryption key and payload are embedded within the source.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts a payload using Fernet with a hardcoded key and executes it dynamically. This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code during setup can allow malicious actions such as system compromise, data theft, or establishing backdoors. The code structure, obfuscated class name, and embedded encrypted payload suggest concealment of malicious intent. The use of 'exec' with decrypted data is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The package metadata appears normal but masks potentially harmful behavior during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, as it decrypts and executes code during installation without transparent disclosure. The use of obfuscated class names, embedded encrypted payload, and dynamic code execution are red flags indicating potential malware or malicious activity. This package should be considered unsafe until thoroughly reviewed and verified.",
