{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload during Windows installation and executes it via exec(), with obfuscated class name and descriptions, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload and the hardcoded Fernet key within the run() method, which is invoked during setup on Windows.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decrypted code, which is hidden and potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "Decryption of the payload from the hardcoded string, then passing the decrypted code directly to exec() during setup execution on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name, encrypted payload with hardcoded key, dynamic execution via exec(), and code that runs during package installation without transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet payload and executes it via exec(). The class name and descriptions are obfuscated, and the payload is encrypted, suggesting concealment. The decrypted code is not visible, and executing arbitrary code during setup is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The use of a hardcoded key and encrypted payload further indicates malicious intent. Multiple reports agree on these points, assigning high malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) scores, which are justified given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and likely malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads used to conceal intent. It should be flagged as malicious or at least highly dangerous, and usage should be avoided until further analysis confirms safety.",
