{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tensogflow' that installs dependencies and possibly executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration parameters, package metadata, and executing code within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of exec() on decrypted code, which could execute arbitrary code at install time.",
  "flows": "Decrypted Fernet data in the run() method flows directly into exec(), executing potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload (Fernet), decryption during installation, dynamic code execution via exec(), and the inclusion of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload. The class name and long description appear obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when run, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it with exec(). This decrypted code is potentially malicious, as it runs arbitrary code during package installation. The presence of encrypted data and dynamic execution is unusual and suspicious, especially within a setup context. The script also imports and requires 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, possibly to support network or cryptographic operations. These elements indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior, such as executing hidden backdoors or malicious scripts during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant security risk due to the execution of decrypted, encrypted payload at install time. This behavior could be malicious, providing a backdoor or executing malicious code without user awareness. The obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and use of exec() strongly suggest malicious intent. This package should not be used.",
