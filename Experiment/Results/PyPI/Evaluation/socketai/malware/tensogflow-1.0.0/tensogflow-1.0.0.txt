      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and likely malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads used to conceal intent. It should be flagged as malicious or at least highly dangerous, and usage should be avoided until further analysis confirms safety."
