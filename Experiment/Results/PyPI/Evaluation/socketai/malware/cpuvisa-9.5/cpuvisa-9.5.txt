      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally during setup, strongly indicating malicious behavior. The silent execution, remote server URL, and obfuscation tactics point to a high likelihood of malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
