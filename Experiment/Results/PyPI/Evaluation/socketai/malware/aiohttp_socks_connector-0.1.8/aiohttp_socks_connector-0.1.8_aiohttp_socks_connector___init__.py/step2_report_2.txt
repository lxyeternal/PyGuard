  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are consistent: they are simple Python module initializations, importing classes, functions, error definitions, and setting up the module's `__version__` and `__all__`.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or external input/output is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module interface file for a proxy client library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports describe the code as a benign module setup, which matches the code snippet.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that this code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies as a package init for a proxy client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard structure.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, high confidence, safe.\n\n**Score justification:**  \nMalware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- Same observations as above, consistent and accurate.\n\n**Score justification:**  \nMalware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- Similar to previous, consistent and accurate.\n\n**Score justification:**  \nMalware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Same as above, no issues detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \nMalware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same conclusion, standard package setup.\n\n**Score justification:**  \nMalware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely structural, with no network, data, or code execution elements.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no evident security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's nature. No reason to assign higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**                |\n| Security Risk   | **0**                |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy client library. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context of the entire package. If future code introduces dynamic logic, network operations, or suspicious patterns, reassessment would be necessary. But based solely on this fragment, it is safe.",
