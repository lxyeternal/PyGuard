  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python package `__init__.py`-like file.\n- It imports internal modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, `.helpers`, `.proto`) and re-exports classes, functions, and constants.\n- It defines a version string and an `__all__` list for public API exposure.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or runtime logic.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and standard for a proxy client library.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard package initialization.\n- **Findings:** No sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, typical.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard `__init__.py` setup, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Part of SOCKS proxy handling library.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard package interface.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy client module setup.\n- **Findings:** Imports, no runtime logic, no data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical package initialization.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy-related package component.\n- **Findings:** No data flows, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy client setup.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical module setup, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No significant errors. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- **Scores:** Since all reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis, no adjustments are necessary.\n- **Risk justification:** The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution, and contains no obfuscation or secrets. The risk scores are appropriately low.\n- **Malware concerns:** None. The code is purely structural, serving as an API interface.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, if strict) — given that it's a simple package init file, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, no network activity, no data leaks.  \n- The code is a standard package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n- The highest concern would be if this code was part of a larger package that performs malicious activities, but based solely on this fragment, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
