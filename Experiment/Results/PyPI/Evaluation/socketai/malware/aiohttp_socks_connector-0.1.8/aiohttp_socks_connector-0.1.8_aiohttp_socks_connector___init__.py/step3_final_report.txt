  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure for a SOCKS proxy client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No data input, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and export definitions; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard for a package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup file, importing internal modules and defining the public API. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The code's simplicity and lack of runtime logic indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
