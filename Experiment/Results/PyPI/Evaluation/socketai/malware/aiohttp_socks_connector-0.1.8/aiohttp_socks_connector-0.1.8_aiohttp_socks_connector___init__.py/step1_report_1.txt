{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client library, defining imports, version, and export symbols for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no functions handling external input or output are shown.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and exposes certain classes and functions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and versioning, importing classes and functions from internal modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution. The absence of runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing suggests a benign purpose. The import statements and variable definitions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script defining exports and version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment. It appears safe and typical for a Python library component.",
