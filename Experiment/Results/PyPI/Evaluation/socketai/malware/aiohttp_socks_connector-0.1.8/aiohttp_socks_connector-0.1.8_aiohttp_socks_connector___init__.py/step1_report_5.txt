{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for a SOCKS proxy client, providing connectors, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is processed from external untrusted sources or written to external systems",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow is present; the code only defines imports, constants, and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code present. No unusual or potentially malicious patterns are observable",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the module's namespace with imports and exports, defining version info and available classes/functions. No runtime logic, data processing, or external network interactions are implemented in this snippet. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes and exports relevant components without any suspicious or malicious code.",
