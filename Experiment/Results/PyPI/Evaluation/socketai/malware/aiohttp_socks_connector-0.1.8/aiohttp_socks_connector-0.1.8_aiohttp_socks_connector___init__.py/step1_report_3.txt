{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy library, defining imports, version info, and exporting symbols for proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily performs imports and exports, with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup: importing components from internal modules and defining the module's public API and version. It does not perform any data input/output, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an interface layer. There are no signs of malicious behavior, credential leaks, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initialization file for a proxy library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports and exposes components for external use.",
