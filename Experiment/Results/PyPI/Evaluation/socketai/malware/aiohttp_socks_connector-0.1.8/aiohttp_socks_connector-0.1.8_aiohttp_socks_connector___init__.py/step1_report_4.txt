{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for a proxy client, providing classes, error definitions, and helper functions for establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), including classes, error definitions, and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data are present; no network or file operations are shown.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports components; there are no active data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are evident in this fragment. The version number is standard; no obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, error types, and helper functions from local modules and defines __version__ and __all__ for module export. It functions as an interface or API layer, not executing any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's init or API module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard component of a proxy-related package, serving as an import hub for various classes and functions. No malicious or security-compromising elements are present. The package appears safe based on this fragment.",
