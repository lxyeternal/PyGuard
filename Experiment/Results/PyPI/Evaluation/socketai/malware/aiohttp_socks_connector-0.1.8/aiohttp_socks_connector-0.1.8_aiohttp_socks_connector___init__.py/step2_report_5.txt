  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports consistently identify this code as a standard Python package __init__.py or module setup file.\n   - No runtime logic, network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code solely imports internal modules and defines the public API and version, which is typical and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**\n   - The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n   - The code structure and purpose are clear and standard for a package initializer.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign a 0, justified because there are no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign module setup.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis, all being 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical package initialization module for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code fragment is benign, standard, and safe. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe module setup with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments.",
