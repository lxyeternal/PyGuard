  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxy servers, supporting both direct and proxy-based connections, primarily for asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL (parse_proxy_url), receiving host and port as function arguments, optional socks_url parameter.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers, connecting sockets, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection.",
  "flows": "Source (parse_proxy_url or function arguments) → create_socket_wrapper → sock.connect → asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The use of proxy URLs might be misused if input is untrusted, but this alone is not malicious. No data exfiltration or suspicious external connections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes network connections with SOCKS proxies, parsing proxy URLs to extract connection details. It establishes socket connections and forwards them to asyncio's connection functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. The functions appear to be standard network utility functions for proxy handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. The code relies on external libraries (aiohttp_socks_connector, yarl) which are legitimate for proxy handling. The use of untrusted input (proxy URL) could be misused, but this is common for proxy configuration, not malicious. No indications of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for establishing network connections through SOCKS proxies in an asynchronous Python environment. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is safe for use in legitimate applications, assuming proper input validation elsewhere. No malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are detected.",
