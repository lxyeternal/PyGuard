{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and establish network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), handling URL parsing, credentials, and asynchronous connection setup.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing (parse_proxy_url), input parameters for host, port, proxy URL, credentials",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URL input, socket connection establishment",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts credentials and proxy info -> create_socket_wrapper creates proxy socket -> connect() establishes connection -> asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection uses socket",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard handling of proxy URLs and connections",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection setup using asyncio, with proper URL parsing, credential handling, and socket creation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. Input validation is appropriately handled, and errors are raised for invalid parameters. The potential security concern is the use of untrusted proxy URLs, which could be misused but is a common configuration risk rather than malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0 and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low security risk stems from external input handling, not from the code itself. The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.",
