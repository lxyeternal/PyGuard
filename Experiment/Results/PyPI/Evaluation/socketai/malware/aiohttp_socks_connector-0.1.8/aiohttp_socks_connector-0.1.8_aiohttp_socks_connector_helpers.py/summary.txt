  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low security risk stems from external input handling, not from the code itself. The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate."
