  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard aiohttp proxy connector, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no malicious code, and dynamic URL creation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering potential risks with user input, but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard proxy connector with proper handling, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The code does not contain suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar findings; no malicious activity, standard implementation, external socket wrappers used but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Use of external socket wrappers warrants caution in a real security context, but nothing indicates malicious intent here.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connection logic, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, typical pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal potential concerns with user input handling but no actual threats.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The use of external socket wrappers, while potentially risky if compromised, is not inherently malicious here.\n- The risk scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to user input handling, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's security posture appropriately.",
