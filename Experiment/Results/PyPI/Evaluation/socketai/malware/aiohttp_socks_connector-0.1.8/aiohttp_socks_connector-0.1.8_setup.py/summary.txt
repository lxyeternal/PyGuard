  "confidence": 1,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, decoding and executing obfuscated payloads to compromise the system. The behavior aligns with typical malware tactics involving stealth, obfuscation, and remote control capabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.8-1.0, obfuscated: 0.8-0.9, security risk: 0.75-1.0) are justified and consistent with observed behaviors."
