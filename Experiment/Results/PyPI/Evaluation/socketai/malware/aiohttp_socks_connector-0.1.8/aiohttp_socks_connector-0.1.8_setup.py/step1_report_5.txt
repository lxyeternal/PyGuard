{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package and then execute obfuscated code that likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('USERPROFILE'), reads files ('__init__.py', 'README.md'), and reads base64-encoded strings embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code writes files ('main.cpython-39.py', 'main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs'), executes system commands ('os.system'), and runs a VBScript file ('start main.cpython-39.vbs') which likely executes further payloads.",
  "flows": "The environment variables and files are decoded from base64, written to disk, then the VBScript is executed via 'os.system', potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded scripts that decode into executable code; the code downloads and executes scripts and runs a VBScript, which is suspicious. The environment variable 'USERPROFILE' is used to define TEMP directory. There is indirect code execution via 'os.system'. The purpose of the decoded scripts suggests malware activity, possibly payload download or execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and setting up a package configuration. Then it decodes several base64-encoded payloads, which are written as Python and VBScript files into a temp directory. The decoded Python code includes obfuscated code that appears to download or run additional scripts, including further encoded content. The VBScript is executed with 'os.system' which runs potentially malicious scripts without clear user consent. The use of encoded scripts, dynamic code execution, and running external scripts indicates malicious intent, likely for remote code execution or persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains multiple obfuscated payloads, writes scripts to disk, and executes them, which strongly indicates malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a supply chain attack or malware downloader, executing further malicious scripts. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed by the obfuscation and behaviors.",
