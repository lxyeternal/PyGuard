  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, no malicious behavior detected, standard protocol adherence.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code follows standard procedures without signs of malicious activity. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is low, given no backdoors or data exfiltration.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, no suspicious activity, standard implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is consistent; no malicious indicators are present. The scores seem appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low risk score is justified, and no malware is indicated. The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent reasoning; the scores seem justified.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is consistent with the code's apparent behavior.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting low but non-zero potential for misconfiguration or misuse, which is reasonable given the code's function.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate (after careful review):\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy implementation)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
