  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication through proxies.",
  "sources": "Host resolution functions, input parameters for destination address, user credentials, and proxy server details.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, data sent over the socket, and address resolution results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to resolve addresses, authenticate (if needed), and establish a connection via the proxy, then data flows through the socket to the destination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code follows standard protocol implementations without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols (both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) with proper error handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network-based attacks are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and adheres to expected protocol procedures. No obfuscation techniques or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is therefore 0, and the obfuscation score is 0. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the functionality, though the code's capabilities could be misused if exploited, but that is inherent to proxy client code, not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
