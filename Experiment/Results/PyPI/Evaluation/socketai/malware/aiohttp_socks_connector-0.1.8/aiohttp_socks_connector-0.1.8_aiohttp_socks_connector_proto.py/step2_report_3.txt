  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers; no malicious behavior detected; standard protocol handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malware. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** The malware score of 0 is justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SOCKS proxy implementation; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers; no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The lower risk score reflects the absence of any suspicious activity. The malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; legitimate SOCKS proxy code, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard, non-obfuscated SOCKS proxy code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; low risk score justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content. The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose and the absence of malicious features.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No need to increase malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the potential misuse of proxy capabilities if exploited, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
