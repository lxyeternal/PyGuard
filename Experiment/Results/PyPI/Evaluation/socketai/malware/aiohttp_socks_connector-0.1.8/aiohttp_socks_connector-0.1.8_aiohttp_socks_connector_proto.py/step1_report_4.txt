{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for network connections, facilitating proxy negotiation, connection, and data transmission.",
  "sources": "User input or external data sources include hostname, port, username, password, and address resolution results used in connection and authentication processes.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over sockets via sock_sendall, socket connection attempts, and address resolution functions. Potentially malicious sinks are related to network communications and address resolution.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication steps, then proceeds to network connection and proxy negotiation, finally enabling data transmission through socket send/recv functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No use of obfuscation or hidden code features. The code uses standard libraries and functions for network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with typical authentication and connection procedures. It includes address resolution, authentication handling, and socket management. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code relies on external libraries for event loop detection and socket operations, with appropriate error handling and resource cleanup. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate proxy connection utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy wrapper implementation. It performs expected network operations without signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No indicators of malware, data leaks, or security risks were found. The overall security risk score is low.",
