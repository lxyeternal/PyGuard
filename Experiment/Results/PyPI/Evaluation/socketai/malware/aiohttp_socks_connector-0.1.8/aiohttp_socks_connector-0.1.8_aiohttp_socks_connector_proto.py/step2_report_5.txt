  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The confidence level is high (0.9), and malware/security risk scores are low (0 and 0.2 respectively).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2  \n  These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence is high, and scores are low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2  \n  Consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The confidence remains high, and scores are low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1  \n  Slightly lower risk score, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The same pattern—legitimate implementation, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The scores align with this.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Consistent with previous analyses, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence is high, and scores are low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, exfiltration, or backdoors. **Malware score should be 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are detected. **Obfuscated score should be 0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's function as a SOCKS proxy client, which is common and benign, the overall security risk is low. The scores of 0.1–0.2 are reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative. Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified, a risk score of **0.0 to 0.1** would be more accurate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (preferably 0.0, given no vulnerabilities or suspicious activity)\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent, and the assigned scores are reasonable based on the provided analysis.**",
