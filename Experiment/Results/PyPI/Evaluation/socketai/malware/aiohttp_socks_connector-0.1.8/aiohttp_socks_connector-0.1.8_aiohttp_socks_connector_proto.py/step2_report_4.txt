  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with no malicious behavior detected. It handles standard protocol procedures, error handling appears appropriate, and no obfuscation or suspicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code adheres to standard practices, and no malicious activity is evident. The low risk score is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with proper handling of address resolution, authentication, and connection procedures. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy wrapper with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. It follows typical patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious activity is apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical SOCKS proxy implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. It uses standard libraries and functions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward implementation with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It performs expected proxy operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. The code strictly implements standard SOCKS proxy procedures without any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable implementation.\n- **Risk Scores:** They range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is justified considering the code's functionality and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** I agree with 0 for all reports. No signs of malicious activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2) is reasonable; the overall low risk assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reported scores, acknowledging the low but present minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's analysis.",
