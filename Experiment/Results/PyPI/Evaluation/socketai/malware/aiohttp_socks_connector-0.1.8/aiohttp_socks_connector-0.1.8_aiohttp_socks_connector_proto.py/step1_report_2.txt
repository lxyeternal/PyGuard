{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket connections, including negotiation, connection, and authentication procedures.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user-provided hostnames, ports, and optional credentials (username and password). It also resolves hostnames to IP addresses using getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over sockets during negotiation and connection setup, including authentication credentials if provided. Hostname resolution results are used for connecting, but no data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "Hostnames or IP addresses are resolved, then used to establish proxy connections via negotiation methods. Authentication credentials flow from variables into request messages sent over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses standard socket and asyncio functions. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. Error handling appears appropriate for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The module provides proxy connection wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, handling standard protocol negotiation, optional authentication, and address resolution. It performs hostname resolution locally or remotely based on configuration. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are observed. The code relies on standard libraries and protocols with correct exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It follows expected patterns for network communication and error handling without embedding malicious logic.",
