{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (host, port, username, password, rdns settings), network responses from proxy servers, and data to send over sockets.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for sending and receiving data, particularly during negotiation, authentication, and connection setup.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> socket connection -> negotiation/authentication -> data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard SOCKS proxy operations, with no obfuscated elements or unusual behavior. No data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers, handling common proxy operations such as address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It correctly handles errors and network responses without any hidden or malicious code. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or unauthorized actions are present. The code does not include any logic for external data transmission outside normal proxy protocols. No signs of malware or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs typical network proxy functions securely and appropriately.",
