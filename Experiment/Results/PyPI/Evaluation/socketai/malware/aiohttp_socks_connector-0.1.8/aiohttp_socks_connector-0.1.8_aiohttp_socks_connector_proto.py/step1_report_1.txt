{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connections through a proxy server.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user-defined parameters (host, port, username, password) during initialization and during address resolution. It also reads from network sockets during negotiation and data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Network socket communication methods (sock_sendall, sock_recv) are used to send and receive data over the network. Potential sink points include sending proxy requests and receiving proxy responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into address resolution and proxy negotiation routines, which then send requests via sockets. Network responses are read and processed to establish connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code performs standard SOCKS proxy handshake procedures. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs are present. No malicious privacy violations or data theft methods are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements asynchronous socket operations for SOCKS proxy negotiation, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It handles various SOCKS versions and address types. Error handling appears appropriate. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access are evident. The code strictly adheres to proxy protocol standards without hiding intent or executing hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers without malicious intent. There are no indicators of malware, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It primarily facilitates proxy connections with standard procedures.",
