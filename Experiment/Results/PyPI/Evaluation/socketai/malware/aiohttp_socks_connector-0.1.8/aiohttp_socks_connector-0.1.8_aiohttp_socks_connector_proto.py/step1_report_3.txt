{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate asynchronous network connections through a proxy server, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "User-supplied proxy host and port; destination host and port; potential user credentials; data received from the proxy server during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Network socket communication (sock_sendall, sock_recv, sock_connect); address resolution; raising exceptions based on server responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) is sent to proxy servers; responses from the server are read and interpreted; successful negotiation leads to data being relayed through the proxy socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. The code performs standard proxy negotiation and connection procedures. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asynchronous classes to handle SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It uses standard socket operations, proper exception handling, and typical proxy communication sequences. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, system damage, or covert channels, is present. The code focuses on establishing a network connection via proxies, with no suspicious or hidden activities. Use of external libraries (asyncio, socket, struct) is typical for such functionality and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to standard practices for asynchronous network communication and proxy negotiation. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
