  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS/proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, inheriting from standard exceptions, serving as error handling scaffolding.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The actual code matches the reports' descriptions. The classes are simple and only define exception types.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.\n- The scores assigned for obfuscated (0), malware (0), and securityRisk (0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or points to challenge:**\n- Since all reports agree, and the code is purely exception class definitions, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is detected.\n- The securityRisk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, serving as a standard part of a larger error handling system.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security concern exists here.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a safe, standard implementation of exception classes with no issues to flag.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe current scores are appropriate, and I concur with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
