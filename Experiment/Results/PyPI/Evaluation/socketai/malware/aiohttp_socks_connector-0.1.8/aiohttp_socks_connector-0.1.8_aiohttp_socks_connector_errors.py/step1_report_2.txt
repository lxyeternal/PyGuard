{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input, no external data reading; all are class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic execution, only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes to represent various SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behavior are present. The structure is straightforward, with clear inheritance hierarchies for exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for exception handling purposes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library or module that manages SOCKS proxy connections. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
