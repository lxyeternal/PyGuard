  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; solely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no output, no external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing occurs within these class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes inheriting from base Python exception types, primarily to handle SOCKS proxy related errors and connection issues. All classes are straightforward, with no embedded logic, data manipulation, or external calls. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The structure is simple, indicating use for organized exception handling in a larger codebase. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions as part of an error handling mechanism for SOCKS proxy operations, with no suspicious or harmful features.",
