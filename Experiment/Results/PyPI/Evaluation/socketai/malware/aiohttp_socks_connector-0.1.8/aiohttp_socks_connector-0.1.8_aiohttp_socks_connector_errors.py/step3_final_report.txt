  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors to be used in error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static class definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, serving as error handling scaffolding. No dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
