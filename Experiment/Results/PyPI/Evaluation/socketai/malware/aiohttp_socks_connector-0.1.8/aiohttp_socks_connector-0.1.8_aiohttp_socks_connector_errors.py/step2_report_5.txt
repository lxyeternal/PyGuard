  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or network operations.\n   - The original code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling in network modules.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware presence, and the malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely for exception handling, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Proposed final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for SOCKS/proxy error handling. No issues or risks are present.",
