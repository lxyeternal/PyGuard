  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all code consists of class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from base exception types such as Exception and OSError. There are no function calls, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The classes are simply structured to handle specific SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, indicating an intent for error handling within a proxy-related module. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, used for structured error handling.",
