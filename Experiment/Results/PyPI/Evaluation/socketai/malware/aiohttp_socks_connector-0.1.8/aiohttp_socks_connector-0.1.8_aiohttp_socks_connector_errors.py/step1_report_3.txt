  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and related error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception types. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure and content are typical for error handling modules in network-related Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
