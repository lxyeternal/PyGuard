  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; only exception classes are defined.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard exceptions. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detectable. The code appears to be a standard, safe error handling setup for a SOCKS/proxy library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or anomalous behavior.",
