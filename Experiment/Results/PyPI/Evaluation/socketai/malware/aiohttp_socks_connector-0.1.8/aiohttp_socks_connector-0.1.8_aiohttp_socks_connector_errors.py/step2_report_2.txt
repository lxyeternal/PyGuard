  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\nThe provided code consists solely of custom exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. All classes inherit from standard exceptions, and there are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other dynamic behaviors. The code is static, straightforward, and appears to be part of an error handling framework.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code contains only class definitions with no signs of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- **Errors or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No. All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. They correctly note the absence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Score Analysis\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores\n- Since there is no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign error handling setup.\n\n### Score Consistency\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and clear.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- Given the simplicity and standard nature of these exception classes, there is no reason to assign higher scores.  \n- The reports are accurate in their analysis and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
