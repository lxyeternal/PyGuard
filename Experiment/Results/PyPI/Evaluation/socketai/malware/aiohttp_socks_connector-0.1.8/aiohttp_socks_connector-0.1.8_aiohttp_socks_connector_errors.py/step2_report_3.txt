  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions (Exception, OSError). There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or any dynamic behavior. The code is static, simple, and typical for error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Confirming issues:**  \n  The code contains only class definitions; no logic, data handling, or network operations. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  **No issues are present.** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n\n- All reports uniformly state that the code is only class definitions, with no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent.  \n- They correctly identify the absence of data flow, input handling, or external interactions.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**The reports' reasoning is accurate and consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The highest scores are for malware and security risk, both at 0.  \n- Since the code is only exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, these scores are justified as 0.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Evaluation**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or hidden payloads are present.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the static nature of the code.  \n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments align with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious code present.                |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, no external interactions, no data handling.           |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.",
