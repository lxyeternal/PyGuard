  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is solely defining custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. The code matches the original code snippet provided.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as straightforward class definitions with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.  \n- They correctly identify that there are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.  \n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code.  \n- The confidence score is 1, which seems reasonable due to the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- The overall scoring appears consistent and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since all reports conclude there are no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues, raising risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.  \n- The code is purely for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**  \n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they explicitly state the code is benign.  \n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately scored.**  \nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code snippet is benign, with no security concerns.**",
