  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious and potentially malicious behavior through obfuscated, conditional PowerShell execution embedded in a package setup script. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify elevated malware and security risk scores. Without decoding the payload, certainty cannot be achieved, but the indicators strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated with caution until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
