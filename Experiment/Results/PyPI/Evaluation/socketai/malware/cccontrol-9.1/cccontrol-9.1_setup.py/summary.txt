  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. While the exact payload remains unknown without decoding, the pattern aligns with common malicious techniques. The scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware at approximately 0.8, obfuscation at 0.9, and security risk at 0.8, indicating a significant security concern."
