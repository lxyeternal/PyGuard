{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with metadata and conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command; embedded URL comment.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess; potential network activity or payload download if decoded.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess execution; encoded command runs if condition met; potential data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command; execution with hidden window; suppression of errors via broad try-except; suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup with an embedded malicious payload. The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious due to obfuscation, conditional execution, and hidden window flags. The URL comment suggests malicious hosting. Error suppression may hide failures. Scores assigned in reports reflect high suspicion; decoding the payload would confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicating malicious activity. The setup script appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious behavior. Scores of malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified based on observed indicators.",
