  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicating malicious activity. The setup script appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious behavior. Scores of malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.85) are justified based on observed indicators."
