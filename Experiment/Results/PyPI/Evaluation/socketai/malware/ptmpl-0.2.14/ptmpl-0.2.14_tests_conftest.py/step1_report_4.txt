{
  "purpose": "This module provides test fixtures for pytest to load supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a JSON file located at 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json'.",
  "sinks": "The data read from the JSON file is passed directly to the constructors of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve classes; no untrusted data is executed or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "load_test_data() reads from the file -> supplies data to SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors in fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code reads a JSON file and constructs objects without any suspicious operations or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to load JSON data from a specific file path, and provides pytest fixtures to instantiate supply and demand curve objects with this data. The data reading involves opening a JSON file, reading its content, and parsing it with json.loads(). No untrusted input is processed dynamically, nor is there any data leakage or code injection. The overall structure appears straightforward and standard for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility that loads data from a JSON file and creates objects for testing. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security issues present.",
