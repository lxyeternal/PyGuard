{
  "purpose": "This module sets up test fixtures for PyTest, loading test data from a JSON file and creating instances of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' via open() within the load_test_data() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network communication, system modification, or sensitive data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the JSON file in load_test_data() into Python data structures, then into the constructors of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve via fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The file path is hardcoded but benign in a test context.",
  "analysis": "The code loads test data from a JSON file, parsing it and passing it into curve objects for testing. The process is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The use of standard libraries and fixtures aligns with common testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It safely reads test data and creates objects for testing purposes.",
