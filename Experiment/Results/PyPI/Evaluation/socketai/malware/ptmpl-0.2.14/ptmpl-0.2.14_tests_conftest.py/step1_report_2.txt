{
  "purpose": "The code provides test fixtures for loading supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for use in pytest-based testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads a JSON file at 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json'.",
  "sinks": "The JSON data is loaded into memory and passed to class constructors; no data is sent externally or to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "The source is the file read operation, and the data flows into SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a JSON file from a fixed path, loads its content, and passes the data into class constructors. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved, and the process appears standard for test setup. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and focused on loading test data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test fixture setup with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply loads test data from a file and provides it to test functions.",
