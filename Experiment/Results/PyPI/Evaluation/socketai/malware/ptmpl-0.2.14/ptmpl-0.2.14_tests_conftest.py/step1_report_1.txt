{
  "purpose": "This module provides pytest fixtures to load test data and instantiate supply and demand curve objects for testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads a JSON file 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' to load test data.",
  "sinks": "The loaded data is passed to the constructors of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve; no untrusted data directly reaches sensitive sinks like system commands or network.",
  "flows": "File read -> json.loads -> supply/demand curve constructors with data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The file path is static and used solely for test data loading.",
  "analysis": "The code reads test data from a JSON file located within the test directory. It loads the JSON content and extracts 'supply_demand' data to instantiate curve objects. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code appears to be standard test setup code without any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test fixture code that loads test data and instantiates objects. There is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
