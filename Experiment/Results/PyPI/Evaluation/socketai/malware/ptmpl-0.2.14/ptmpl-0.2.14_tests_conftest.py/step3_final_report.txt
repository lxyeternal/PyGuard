  "purpose": "Load test data from a JSON file and instantiate supply and demand curve objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading from a static JSON file at 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' and parsing its content with json.loads.",
  "sinks": "Passing the parsed data into class constructors; no untrusted data reaches system or network sinks.",
  "flows": "File read -> json.loads -> supply_demand data -> SupplyCurve/DemandCurve constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with static file path and standard JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code loads test data from a fixed JSON file, parses it, and uses it to create curve objects. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The data handling is limited to local file reading and data passing into constructors. No secrets, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code's simplicity and static data source indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test fixture setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely loads test data and creates objects without any suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscation is 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
