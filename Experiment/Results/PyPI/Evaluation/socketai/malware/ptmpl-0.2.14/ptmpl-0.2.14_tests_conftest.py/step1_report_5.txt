  "purpose": "The code defines test fixtures for PyTest, loading supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for use in testing the 'py_pkg.curves' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a JSON file located at 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json'.",
  "sinks": "Data read from the JSON file is passed to SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors. No other untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "File read operation -> json.loads -> supply_demand data passed to curve constructors.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to perform standard file reading and data loading for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code loads test data from a JSON file to provide fixtures for supply and demand curves in testing. The file path is hardcoded, but this is typical for test data. The json.loads function is used securely to parse JSON data. No user input or untrusted external data is involved at runtime; all data comes from a local test file. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test fixture setup for loading JSON test data into curve objects. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The code appears safe and appropriate for testing purposes.",
