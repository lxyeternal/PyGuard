  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata file providing version and package information for the Python package 'py-package-template'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables defined within the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; it is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static metadata definition with no dynamic or external data handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code is present. The reports provided are empty, indicating no analysis or findings. Therefore, there is no evidence of security issues, malware, or vulnerabilities in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The package metadata code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
