  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors, meaning no detailed findings or issues are provided. Therefore, I cannot confirm any specific vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws based on these reports.\n\n2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:\n- The reports lack any substantive content or evidence. This makes it impossible to evaluate the security posture or identify issues. The absence of details suggests either a failure in reporting or an incomplete review process.\n\n3. Review the scores given to each issue:\n- Since no issues are described, no scores are provided. No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:\n- No issues are identified, so no risk scores are assigned. Without evidence, assigning high risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. Pay close attention to the malware score:\n- No malware-related findings are reported. Given the absence of information, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- There are no claims or assumptions made in the reports, so no challenge is needed.\n\n7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report:\n- Since no scores are provided, consistency isn't an issue here.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet provided is a straightforward `__version__.py` file containing package metadata. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are empty, offering no evidence or analysis to review.\n- Based on the available data, there is no reason to suspect malware, obfuscation, or significant risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or suggested)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to lack of evidence; essentially negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout additional details or evidence, the security risk associated with this code appears minimal. The empty reports do not justify any concern.",
