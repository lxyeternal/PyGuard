  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is merely a comment block with no executable statements, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - There are no sources, sinks, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not contain any secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is just a comment block with no executable or malicious content.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0.\n   - This is justified because the code is purely a comment with no executable or suspicious content.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as non-executable and non-malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nSince the code is just a comment block with no executable code, data flow, or external interactions, there is no security concern. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code itself poses no security or malware risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings.",
