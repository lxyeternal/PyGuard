{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for supply and demand curve classes and related functions, used to verify the correct implementation of economic models.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (py_pkg.curves), and within test functions, it reads data such as supply and demand curves, and test data for curve points and errors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code only tests the functionality of classes and functions without external data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input leading to security effects; the code runs in a test environment to verify class behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and specific classes/functions from 'py_pkg.curves' to perform unit tests on supply and demand curve classes, including exception handling, curve comparisons, and equilibrium calculations. All data used for tests are hardcoded, and no external inputs or network operations are involved. The code's structure is standard for test suites, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious injections, or backdoors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional test suite verifying the functionality of economic curve models. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
