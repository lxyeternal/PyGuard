{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'curves.py' module, designed to validate functionality of supply and demand curve classes and related economic calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads test input data, such as supply and demand data dictionaries, and imported classes/functions like SupplyCurve, DemandCurve, etc.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling may process output data; however, no untrusted data is sent to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (test data) flows into class constructors and functions; output from these functions (such as computed prices and quantities) is checked via assertions. No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code appears straightforward as a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest-based test suite validating the behavior of supply and demand curve classes. It tests curve comparison, point calculations, extrapolation, exception raising for invalid data, and economic equilibrium calculations. No external data sources, network calls, or file operations are evident. All data inputs are hardcoded in the test cases. There are no signs of malicious logic, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The code structure and logic are typical for unit testing of financial models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional test suite with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs validation of economic models without interacting with external systems or handling untrusted data.",
