{
  "purpose": "This code contains test cases for supply and demand curve classes and related functions, validating their behavior and calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (copy, pytest) and the py_pkg.curves module; test functions that instantiate curve objects and invoke methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within test cases to verify correct behavior; no data flow to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Test functions create curve objects, perform operations, and assert expected results; no untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for curve classes, performing object comparisons, value checks, exception handling, and class interface validation. It uses pytest for testing, with no indication of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be purely for testing purposes, with no external network or system interaction. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite validating the behavior of supply and demand curve classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
