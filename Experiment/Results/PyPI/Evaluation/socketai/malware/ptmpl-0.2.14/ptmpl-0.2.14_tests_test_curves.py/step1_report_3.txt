{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the 'curves.py' module, verifying the functionality of supply and demand curves, their comparison, extrapolation, and equilibrium calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from supply_curve and demand_curve objects, specifically their parameters and method outputs. It also creates test data within the test functions, such as supply_data and demand_data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems. It primarily asserts conditions and performs in-memory computations. No data is sent over the network, stored insecurely, or used in dangerous system calls.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (e.g., supply_data, demand_data) flow into object instantiation, which invoke methods like quantity() and comparisons. These flows do not lead to any external system or untrusted sinks; they are used solely for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard test code. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. All data appears to be static or controlled within tests. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured test suite employing pytest for unit testing various classes and functions in the 'curves.py' module. It verifies correctness of curve interpolation, extrapolation, comparison, exception handling, and economic equilibrium calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external communication. The use of exceptions for validation and in-memory assertions is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for economic curve models. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behavior. The purpose is to validate functionality, and it adheres to safe coding practices without any suspicious activity.",
