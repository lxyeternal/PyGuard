  "purpose": "A comprehensive review of supply and demand curve test suite code to identify potential malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and external data interactions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test data within the code; no external data sources, network calls, or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "All data flows are internal within the test functions; no external or untrusted data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, in-memory pytest-based test suite validating classes and functions related to supply and demand curves. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All tests are standard validation checks, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero. The code structure and data are typical for such testing modules, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It is safe for supply chain use, and the scores should reflect no malicious or security concerns.",
