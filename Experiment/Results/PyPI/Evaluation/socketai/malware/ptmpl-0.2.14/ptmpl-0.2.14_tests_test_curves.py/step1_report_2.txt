{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the supply and demand curves module, validating the functionality of curve comparison, point evaluation, interpolation, extrapolation, exception handling, and equilibrium calculations.",
  "sources": "The code imports testing functions from pytest, and functions/classes from the py_pkg.curves module. It does not read external user input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data externally, nor does it perform network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code strictly performs in-memory tests and assertions on imported classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The test functions only perform assertions on curve behaviors and exceptions. No obfuscated code or hidden dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for a financial modeling module, focusing on validating classes such as SupplyCurve and DemandCurve, as well as their interactions. It tests curve behaviors, exceptions, and equilibrium calculations. No signs of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a conventional test suite for a supply and demand curve module, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It performs in-memory validation of the module's functionalities without external data handling or network activity.",
