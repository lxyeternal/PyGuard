  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate installer routine with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security issue is the unverified download, which poses a supply chain risk but does not constitute active malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting the potential security concern due to lack of validation."
