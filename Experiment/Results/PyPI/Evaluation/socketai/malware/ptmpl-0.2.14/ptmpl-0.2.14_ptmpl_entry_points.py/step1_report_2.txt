{
  "purpose": "Provides entry-point functions for installing a Python package template from GitHub.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via input(), reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, downloads data from a URL via requests.get(), reads/writes files ('temp.zip'), reads from the ZIP archive.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'temp.zip' file, executes requests.get() which accesses external URL, removes 'temp.zip' file, extracts ZIP contents potentially executing code or placing files.",
  "flows": "User command input -> main() decision -> install_template_from_github() prompt -> user response -> requests.get() downloads ZIP -> writes 'temp.zip' -> extracts ZIP content -> deletes 'temp.zip'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses input() for user confirmation; downloads and extracts external code from GitHub without validation; no verification of ZIP contents; no authentication or validation for the downloaded content; no error handling for network or file operations; raises RuntimeError without catching exceptions; no security measures to verify the source.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to download and extract a ZIP archive from a GitHub repository upon user confirmation. It uses 'requests' to fetch remote content, writes it directly to disk, then extracts it, and deletes the archive. The process involves executing potentially untrusted code or files from the ZIP archive if malicious. There is no validation, integrity check, or authentication, and user input is directly used to control behavior. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden behavior, but the lack of validation and reliance on external sources pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and extracts external ZIP content based on user input without validation or verification. While no malicious code is explicitly present, the approach is risky because it can execute or overwrite files with untrusted content. Overall, the code presents a security warning and should be used with caution, but it does not contain active malicious behavior or malware.",
