{
  "purpose": "Provides CLI entry points for a package, downloads a ZIP archive from GitHub, extracts it, and cleans up.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command input, input() for user confirmation, requests.get() for downloading, open() for file writing, ZipFile for extraction",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'temp.zip', extracting files into current directory, deleting 'temp.zip'",
  "flows": "argv[1] -> install_template_from_github() -> requests.get() -> file write -> ZipFile extraction -> remove('temp.zip')",
  "anomalies": "No code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code. Reliance on external URL without validation introduces supply chain risk.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard download and extraction operations with user confirmation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The main security concern is the lack of validation or checksum verification of the downloaded ZIP, which could be exploited if the remote repository is compromised. The use of requests, file operations, and ZIP extraction are standard and benign. The code's structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate installer routine with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security issue is the unverified download, which poses a supply chain risk but does not constitute active malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.4, reflecting the potential security concern due to lack of validation.",
