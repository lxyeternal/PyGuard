{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks for use in economic analysis or simulation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for supply and demand curves, specifically in the __init__ methods of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve classes, as well as input parameters for shocks and equilibrium calculations.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or system command calls are present. No data exfiltration or external communication is observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into supply and demand curve objects during instantiation. These objects are then used in functions like equil_price and equil_price_ranges, which compute equilibrium points and ranges. Shock scenarios modify the curves by shifting prices, but only within the data structures in memory.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward, with clear data handling and exception checks for data integrity (e.g., monotonicity, zero prices). No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are evident. No suspicious dynamic execution or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The module defines classes for modeling economic supply and demand curves with input validation to ensure data consistency. It includes methods for calculating quantities at given prices, as well as functions for determining equilibrium prices and ranges. The use of NumPy arrays ensures efficient data handling. Error handling is in place for data monotonicity violations and invalid zero prices. The shock classes allow for simple shifts in prices, only affecting data in memory. The overall structure is clean, well-documented, and does not include any external calls, system modifications, or network communications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured model for economic curves and their interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are present. The code operates purely in-memory for economic simulations without engaging in harmful activities or data leaks.",
