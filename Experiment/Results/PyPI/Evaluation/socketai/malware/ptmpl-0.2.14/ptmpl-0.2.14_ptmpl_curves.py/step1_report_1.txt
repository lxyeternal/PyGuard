{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks. It is intended for financial and economic analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data points for supply and demand curves (dictionaries with 'price', 'supply', 'demand'), method parameters such as 'price', 'supply_shock', and 'demand_shock'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data in 'data' parameters; application of shocks which could modify curves.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation and sorting → creation of supply/demand curves → equilibrium calculations → potential shocks application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The only exception is the raising of custom exceptions for monotonicity violations, which are standard for data validation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for supply and demand curves, ensuring data validity (monotonicity and non-zero prices). It includes functions for computing equilibrium prices and ranges, with logical handling for edge cases. Custom exceptions indicate validation of data consistency. The shock scenario classes are designed to modify curves, with straightforward translation logic. All data handling and operations appear consistent with typical economic modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for economic modeling, including validation, calculation, and simulation of shocks. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The only notable features are data validation and straightforward data transformations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
