{
  "purpose": "This code models economic supply and demand curves, performs data validation (monotonicity, non-zero prices), computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and applies economic shocks via simple data shifts. It serves as a library for economic analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors; data used internally for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or external communication; all data handling is in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data into class constructors, through validation steps, into numpy arrays, and through functions computing equilibrium prices and applying shocks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Exception handling is standard for data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical modeling with proper validation and exception handling. It uses numpy for efficient array operations. No malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The shocks are simple data shifts, consistent with economic modeling. The exception classes enforce data integrity. No external system interactions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, well-structured economic modeling library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1) are appropriate. The code's behavior is benign, and the scores are justified.",
