{
  "purpose": "This module models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and applies economic shock scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input data for supply and demand curves (list of dicts with 'price' and 'supply'/'demand') used during curve initialization; user input is not directly handled; no external data sources or input streams are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations internally; no explicit data sinks or network communications are present; no data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into curve objects during instantiation; functions like equil_price and equil_price_ranges read internal attributes; apply method modifies curves based on shocks; no external output or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. The exception classes are straightforward. The use of numpy arrays is standard for numerical operations. The code adheres to conventional patterns. No obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code models economic curves with clear data validation, ensuring prices are positive and monotonicity constraints are enforced through custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. Functions compute equilibrium prices using standard array operations. The shock classes modify curves in a transparent manner. The overall structure is typical for scientific modeling code with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured economic modeling library with no malicious or suspicious features. It performs numerical computations and data validation safely. No indicators of malware or security risks are present. The implementation appears safe for use in larger projects.",
