  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on potential security issues, malware signals, obfuscation, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, standard economic modeling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Custom exceptions are standard.\n- **Analysis:** Data validation, monotonicity checks, and equilibrium calculations are straightforward. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with minimal security risk (0.1). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code appears safe and well-structured. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard economic modeling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Validates data, computes equilibrium via standard array operations, and applies shocks transparently.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage. Security risk is minimal (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The code's security posture is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous; input data is internal.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Data validation, equilibrium calculations, and shocks are straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; security risk remains minimal (0).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; in-memory data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Data validation, equilibrium computations, and shocks are standard. No malicious activities.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; security risk is low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; data is internal.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system calls or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data processing, equilibrium calculations, and simple shifts for shocks. No malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious features; security risk is low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious code patterns. The highest observed security risk is around 0.1, which accounts for potential data validation issues but not malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is purely computational, with input validation and no external interactions, a risk score of around 0.1-0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Minimal, mostly due to potential input validation issues or misuse, but no real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard economic modeling library with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
