  "purpose": "This code models economic supply and demand curves, calculates equilibrium prices, and simulates economic shocks.",
  "sources": [
    "Initialization of supply and demand data in the SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors.",
    "Methods such as quantity() that access internal curve data.",
    "Equil_price() and equil_price_ranges() functions that analyze internal data arrays.",
    "apply() method in HorizPriceShock that modifies curve data based on shocks."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "quantify() methods return float values based on internal data.",
    "equil_price() and equil_price_ranges() produce a float or None based on data analysis.",
    "apply() in HorizPriceShock creates new curve objects with altered prices, which could potentially be malicious if misused, but appear benign.",
    "No data is written to external systems or files."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input data in the form of dicts with 'price' and 'supply'/'demand' keys -> stored in class attributes.",
    "Price data sorted and validated during object initialization.",
    "quantify() methods retrieve quantities based on internal arrays.",
    "equil_price() compares supply and demand quantities across the price domain.",
    "apply() in HorizPriceShock creates new curves with shifted prices based on shocks."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual hardcoded data.",
    "Exception handling for curve monotonicity is standard.",
    "No obfuscated code or use of dynamic execution.",
    "The only modifications are simple linear shifts in prices, which are standard for economic models."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard economic curve modeling with data validation and error handling. The methods for computing equilibrium prices are based on internal arrays and straightforward logic. No external system calls, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The apply() method creates modified curve objects in a safe manner. The code structure and functions align with normal modeling practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides a standard, well-structured economic modeling library without any suspicious or malicious code. The only operations involve data sorting, validation, and simple transformations of internal data. There is no malware or malicious behavior detected.",
