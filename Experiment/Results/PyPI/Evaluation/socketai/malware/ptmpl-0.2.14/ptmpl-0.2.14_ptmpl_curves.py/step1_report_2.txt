{
  "purpose": "This module models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and applies economic shock scenarios, intended for use in economic analysis and simulations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for supply and demand curves via the 'data' parameter in class constructors, specifically the sequences of dicts containing 'price' and 'supply'/'demand' keys.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. The only computations are numerical and data transformations within the class methods.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the supply and demand curve classes, which process and store data in numpy arrays. The 'equil_price' and 'equil_price_ranges' functions compute equilibrium values based on these stored data. The 'apply' method in shock scenario classes modifies curves by shifting prices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code follows standard patterns for data modeling and numerical computations. Exception classes are straightforward. No suspicious network activity or system manipulation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to model supply and demand curves with monotonicity constraints, ensuring data integrity. It computes equilibrium prices and ranges via numerical comparisons, which are standard in economic modeling. The 'apply' method in shock scenario classes shifts prices, which aligns with expected economic shock simulations. Exception handling is used appropriately for data validation. There are no signs of malicious intent or covert operations; the code operates solely within its defined scope of economic calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of economic curve modeling with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It focuses on numerical data handling, validation, and transformations for economic analysis. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
