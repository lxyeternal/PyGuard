  "purpose": "Automates downloading and executing a remote shell script during post-installation.",
  "sources": "Requests the URL 'https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh' to fetch a script, and uses os.system and subprocess.run to execute commands/scripts.",
  "sinks": "executes the downloaded script with '/bin/bash', runs system commands ('apt update && apt install tmux -y').",
  "flows": "Downloads script from URL -> saves to local path -> makes executable -> runs shell script via bash -> also runs system commands to update system and install packages.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads and executes a remote script without validation or verification, uses os.system for system commands, which can be manipulated or contain malicious instructions, and runs a script from an untrusted source.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a script from a remote URL and executes it without any verification or signature checks. It also runs system update and package installation commands insecurely. The use of os.system and subprocess.run to execute scripts from untrusted sources presents a high security risk. The script URL is hardcoded, and no input validation is performed. The script could contain malicious commands that execute arbitrary code on the host system, including data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by downloading and executing a remote script without verification, posing a significant security threat. It should not be used in production environments without proper validation and security checks.",
