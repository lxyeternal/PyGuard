{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote script from an untrusted URL, saves it locally, makes it executable, and executes it without validation. It also runs system commands to update the package list and install 'tmux'. This pattern indicates potential malicious activity or supply chain attack behavior.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh' via requests.get(), reading from the network; no validation or checksum verification is performed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.run() and os.system(); system commands 'apt update && apt install tmux -y' executed directly, potentially affecting system integrity.",
  "flows": "Remote script fetched through requests.get() → saved to local file → permissions set → executed via subprocess.run() and os.system(); system commands run directly after download, enabling potential malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unvalidated remote code download and execution; no checksum or signature verification; running system commands during package installation; writing script to user's home directory without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a script from an external URL and executes it without any validation, creating a significant security risk. It also runs system commands that modify the system state. The absence of validation, combined with execution of untrusted code, indicates a high potential for malicious activity. The straightforward code structure and lack of obfuscation confirm that the behavior is intentional and suspicious. Given the high risk of supply chain attacks, the malware score should be set high, and the overall security risk is severe.",
  "conclusion": "This code pattern is highly insecure and potentially malicious, enabling remote code execution without validation. It should be considered a serious security concern, with a high likelihood of malicious intent or behavior. The scores reflect this risk, with malware at approximately 0.85 and security risk at 0.9.",
