{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to download a shell script from a remote URL, save it locally, make it executable, and then run it with specific arguments. Additionally, it updates the system and installs a package (tmux).",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh') via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script is executed via subprocess.run() and os.system(). The system commands 'apt update && apt install tmux -y' are also executed, potentially affecting system configuration.",
  "flows": "Input from the URL flows into a local file, then is executed as a shell script. System update and package installation commands are run directly via os.system().",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads and executes a remote shell script without validation, which is risky. The URL used is obscure and not a well-known source. Running arbitrary scripts from the internet during post-installation is highly suspicious. The script also installs system packages without user consent. There is no verification of the downloaded content's integrity or authenticity.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defines a function that downloads a shell script from a specified URL. It writes this script to a file in the user's home directory, sets executable permissions, and then runs system update and package installation commands. The script then executes the downloaded shell script with specific parameters. Downloading and executing remote scripts without validation poses a significant security risk. The use of os.system for critical system commands further increases risk, as it is prone to command injection if inputs are compromised. The overall behavior suggests potential malicious intent, especially given the lack of verification and the automatic execution of remote code during post-installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its automatic download and execution of remote scripts, system modification commands, and lack of validation. It could be used to execute malicious code or backdoors during package installation. The behavior aligns with malicious supply chain activity.",
