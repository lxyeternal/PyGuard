  "purpose": "Template project for developing new Python packages, intended as a cookie-cutter scaffold.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only descriptive docstring and comment lines, with no executable logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module-level docstring and a comment header indicating its purpose as a package template. There are no functions, classes, imports, or executable statements. No data inputs, sinks, or flows are present. This minimal code does not perform any operations, nor does it contain any hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual features. Given the lack of actual logic, no security risks or malware behaviors can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple template or placeholder for a Python package, containing no executable logic or security concerns. It does not pose any malware or security risks.",
