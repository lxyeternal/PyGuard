{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal template or scaffold for developing new Python packages, primarily consisting of descriptive comments and docstrings without executable logic.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources, input reads, or external data interactions present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks exist, since the code lacks any executable or data-processing components.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a module-level docstring and comments, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a descriptive comment block with no functions, classes, imports, or executable statements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, as is the security risk score. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward, static nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal template with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
