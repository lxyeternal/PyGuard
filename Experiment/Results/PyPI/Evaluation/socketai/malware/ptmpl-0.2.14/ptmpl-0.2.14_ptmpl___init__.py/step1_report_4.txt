  "purpose": "A package template for developing new Python packages, intended as a cookie-cutter or boilerplate.",
  "sources": "No data input, user input, environment variables, or external data sources used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network transmission, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only a descriptive comment and a string assignment; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a multi-line string describing the package purpose and a brief docstring comment. There are no functions, no data processing, no external calls, and no potentially malicious constructs. The code functions as a template or placeholder with no active code, making it inherently safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static comment and string assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears as a boilerplate template, with no active or suspicious code present.",
