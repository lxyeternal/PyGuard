{
  "purpose": "This code imports 'console' from the 'conio' module, which is a non-standard, third-party package. There is no malicious activity evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'conio' module; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are observable beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard 'conio' module; no other anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, with no further logic or data manipulation. The 'conio' module is not part of Python's standard library and could be third-party or platform-specific. Given the minimal code, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, considering the non-standard package usage but lack of malicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), as the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign with no malicious behavior detected. The use of 'conio' warrants verification in the broader context, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain risk is minimal. Scores are consistent with the evidence.",
