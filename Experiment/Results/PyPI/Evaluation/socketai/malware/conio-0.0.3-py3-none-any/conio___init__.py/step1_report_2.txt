{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'console' module from the 'conio' package, likely intended for console I/O operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'conio' package; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing a module without further actions. 'conio' is a third-party package that can be used maliciously if misused, but here, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of 'console' from 'conio'. There are no inputs, no data processing, no output or network activity. The minimal nature of the code reduces suspicion, but the 'conio' package has historically been used for console UI interactions; without additional context, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward import without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security risks are evident based on this snippet alone.",
