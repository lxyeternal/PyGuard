{
  "purpose": "Import the 'console' object or module from the 'conio' package, likely for console-based input/output operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement reads from the 'conio' package, which is a third-party module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink in this isolated statement.",
  "anomalies": "The 'conio' package is known for console I/O functions; however, the presence of this import alone is not suspicious. No code executes or manipulates data yet. 'conio' is less common and could be used for malicious input handling, but no malicious behavior is evident here.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports 'console' from 'conio', which is a package used for console input/output. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues in this single line. Without additional context or code, it cannot be determined if the imported module contains malicious code or if its use is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import of a console module. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this line alone. Further code review is needed to determine if malicious activities are present.",
