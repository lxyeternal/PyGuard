      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential theft, remote control, and data exfiltration. It employs multiple techniques to conceal its activities and execute malicious commands. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score is maximal. The obfuscation level is moderate, and the code should be flagged and prevented from execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing token theft, data exfiltration, remote access setup, and concealment techniques. The malware score should be 1, the obfuscation score around 0.2 due to minimal obfuscation, and the security risk score should be 1, reflecting the high threat level."
