  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration file for a Python package, primarily used to define package metadata, dependencies, and test commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'pyquest/__version__.py', reading 'README.md', reading input from command line arguments, importing modules, reading package data files.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands via os.system (for publishing the package), executing code read from '__version__.py', executing code indirectly through setup() and subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Version info and metadata are read and executed, then used to configure package setup. Command-line arguments may trigger system commands for publishing. Data read from files is executed or passed into setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of '__version__.py' (potential for code execution if malicious code is present in version file). Reading files with 'open' and specifying encoding is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code uses os.system() to run shell commands for publishing, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but in this static context, it's safe. No obfuscated code or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package. It reads version info and readme content from files, with exec() used to execute version info—potentially risky if the version file contains malicious code, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. The os.system calls for publishing are typical in setup scripts but could be exploited if inputs are tampered with, though in this static script they appear safe. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The script's main functions are metadata setup, dependency declaration, and test command configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with typical practices. The only potential concern is the use of exec() on a version file, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but this is common in setup scripts. No malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Overall, the code does not contain malware or security risks beyond the noted exec() usage.",
