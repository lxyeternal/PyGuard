  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, handling dependency management, version checks, and testing configuration.",
  "sources": "sys.argv, os.system calls, file reading with open, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing shell commands, exec() reading version info from a file, file read operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) trigger os.system commands; version info is read from files using open(), then executed with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on file content poses a potential security concern if the file contents are maliciously modified. os.system calls are used for packaging commands but appear standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The script's primary purpose is package setup, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks, dependency setup, and packaging commands typical for a Python project. The exec() function dynamically executes code read from a local version file, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but in typical usage, this is controlled and not malicious. os.system commands are used for publishing the package, which are standard in setup scripts. No evidence of data leakage, malware, or malicious network activity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns found.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script with a potentially risky exec() call for reading version info, but this is typical in setup files and not inherently malicious. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is benign in the context of package setup.",
