{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure the setup and installation process for a Python package named 'pyquest', including dependency management, version checks, and test setup.",
  "sources": "Reading package version info from '__version__.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'pyquest/__version__.py' and 'README.md' files.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'os.system' commands for publishing ('publish' command), no untrusted data sinks detected otherwise.",
  "flows": "Input from command line arguments triggers 'os.system' commands; version info read from files is static, no dynamic or untrusted input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'exec' to execute contents of '__version__.py', which could be risky if the file content is malicious or tampered; however, this is a common pattern for dynamic version assignment. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks for Python version compatibility, custom test command configuration, and package setup configuration. The use of 'exec' on a version file could pose a risk if the file is malicious, but this is a standard practice in setup scripts. The 'os.system' call on 'publish' command could execute arbitrary shell commands if manipulated, but it is limited to packaging and uploading, which is typical. No indications of malware such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with minimal risk features. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' on a local version file, which is common but could be risky if the file is malicious. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware signs are detected. Overall, it appears safe, with low confidence that there are malicious elements.",
