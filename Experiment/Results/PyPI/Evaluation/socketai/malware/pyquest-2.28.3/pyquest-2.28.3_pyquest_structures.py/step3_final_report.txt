{
  "purpose": "Defines internal data structures for case-insensitive headers and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data in constructors, key access and modification methods (__setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__), and the copy method.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal storage, with key lookups and modifications operating on the internal OrderedDict; no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is an OrderedDict_values view, not a full copy; this may be unintended but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard dictionary-like classes with no external data processing, network activity, or code execution. The only minor concern is the copy() method returning a view rather than a copy, which could lead to bugs but not security issues. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only minor point is the copy() method, which could be improved for correctness but does not pose security risks.",
