  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides cookie handling utilities, with no signs of malicious activity. It’s a legitimate utility module.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, standard, and well-structured. The low risk score (0.1) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The score is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie utilities with no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code’s purpose. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable given the handling of sensitive cookie data, but no malicious intent is detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a structured, standard cookie management utility with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code’s functions. The risk score remains low, reflecting standard cookie handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie utilities, no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent with the code. The risk score is suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified, given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set at 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation; set at 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), all justifiable given the code’s purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (since the code is a utility library with minimal inherent risk, and no malicious behavior detected)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
