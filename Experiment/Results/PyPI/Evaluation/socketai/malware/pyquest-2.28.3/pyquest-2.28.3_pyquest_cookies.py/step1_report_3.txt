{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and a CookieJar implementation for managing cookies within the requests library, including functions for extracting, setting, and merging cookies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as calendar, copy, time, threading, and internal utilities; reads HTTP headers, request URLs, and cookie attributes; accesses response._original_response.msg and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction and header generation functions; cookie set, get, delete, and update methods; potentially sensitive data like cookies are handled, but no direct leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → Cookie extraction and header manipulation → Cookie creation and management functions, including setting, getting, removing, and merging cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears standard for cookie management with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to cookie handling, including wrapper classes and utility functions for cookie extraction, creation, and management. It uses standard libraries and patterns without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external network communications, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors are present. It primarily interacts with HTTP headers, request URLs, and cookie data in a typical manner for HTTP client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of cookie management utilities intended for HTTP requests. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It functions as a compatibility layer and does not perform any harmful actions or exhibit suspicious patterns.",
