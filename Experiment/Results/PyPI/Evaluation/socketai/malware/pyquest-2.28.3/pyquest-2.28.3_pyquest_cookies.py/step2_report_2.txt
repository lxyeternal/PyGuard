  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, code quality, logical consistency, and scoring appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate utility module for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard cookie management functions without any suspicious patterns. The malware score is appropriately low. The risk score is also reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describing standard cookie utilities with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, no malicious behavior detected. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) remains reasonable, considering the utility functions could be misused if misconfigured, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on cookie extraction, creation, and management; no malicious activity identified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with previous reports; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior analyses, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate. The code is a utility module for cookie handling, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the utility nature, a score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate; no significant vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
