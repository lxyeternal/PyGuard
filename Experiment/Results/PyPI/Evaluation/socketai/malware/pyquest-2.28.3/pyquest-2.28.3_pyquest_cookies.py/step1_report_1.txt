  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Requests request object headers, request URL, response headers, Morsel objects, and input dictionaries for cookie creation.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie extraction into jar, cookie removal by name, cookie jar updates, and cookie serialization.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers or external dictionaries flow into cookie creation, management, or extraction functions. Cookies are created or removed based on input, then stored or retrieved from cookie jars, with data potentially flowing to header generation or into the cookie jar.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures; functions follow standard patterns for cookie handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code maintains standard security practices, e.g., proper handling of cookie expiration and cookie conflicts.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard utilities for cookie handling within the requests ecosystem, including cookie creation, extraction, removal, and conversion. It wraps existing library functions and introduces compatibility layers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communication outside typical cookie management tasks. All functions perform expected roles with appropriate handling of data. The cookie management methods correctly handle potential conflicts and ensure safe cookie handling. No suspicious external network connections or harmful code patterns are identified. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate utility module for cookie management within the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to standard practices for handling cookies securely and compatibly. The risk of malicious activity is very low.",
