  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. It manages cookies, extracts them, creates them, and converts formats, all within expected patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard cookie utilities, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, justified by the benign utility functions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cookie management functions, no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, with no suspicious or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie utilities, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, utility functions for cookie management with no malicious behavior.\n\n- The malware scores are all 0, matching the analysis.\n\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — very low, as all reports suggest.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie handling within the requests ecosystem, with no malicious intent or security concerns evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The scores assigned reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.",
