  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie handling, extraction, creation, and management within the requests library, ensuring compatibility with cookie policies and formats.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, request URL, cookie attributes (max-age, expires), response headers, and cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Cookie creation, setting cookies in CookieJar, extracting cookies into CookieJar, and generating Cookie headers for requests.",
  "flows": "Input data from request headers and cookie dicts flow into cookie creation and setting functions; cookies are extracted from responses and stored; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, and cookie jar manipulation. It does not contain obfuscation, network activity, or malicious patterns. The functions handle cookie attributes safely, with no signs of data leakage or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for cookie handling with no malicious intent or security issues. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code poses no significant security threat.",
