  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities and extensions for handling cookies in requests, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, and cookies; accesses response headers and message objects; reads cookie parameters and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie headers, modifies CookieJar and cookies, potentially affecting cookie handling behavior.",
  "flows": "Input request data (URL, headers, cookies) -> processes and potentially modifies cookies or headers -> outputs cookies or headers for requests.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes custom cookie management functions, extensive handling of cookies with potential for hardcoded or manipulated cookie attributes, but no obvious malicious code patterns like network exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a compatibility layer for cookie handling within the requests library, including creating, extracting, and managing cookies. It converts cookies to and from different formats, manipulates CookieJar objects, and handles cookie attributes. No code is present that exfiltrates data, establishes malicious network connections, or manipulates system files. Functions like 'extract_cookies_to_jar' and 'get_cookie_header' are standard cookie processing utilities. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. Overall, the code is standard for cookie management, with no clear malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cookie management utility for the requests library, providing necessary functions for handling cookies compatibly. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
