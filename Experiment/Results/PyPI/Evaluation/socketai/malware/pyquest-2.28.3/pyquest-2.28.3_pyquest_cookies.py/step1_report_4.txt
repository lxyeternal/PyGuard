  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Reading from request headers, response headers, and cookie jar data structures.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie removal, cookie setting, and cookie extraction processes that could manipulate cookie data.",
  "flows": "Input headers and cookie data flow into cookie parsing, conversion, and management functions, ultimately affecting request headers and cookie storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code; no obfuscated or overly complex code. The code adheres to expected cookie handling practices, with no signs of malicious data exfiltration or control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-documented utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library. It facilitates extraction, insertion, deletion, and conversion of cookies with no evident malicious intent. Functions like 'extract_cookies_to_jar' and 'get_cookie_header' interact with HTTP headers in expected ways. The 'remove_cookie_by_name' method filters and deletes cookies based on parameters. The 'RequestsCookieJar' class extends 'cookielib.CookieJar' to add dict-like behavior for ease of use, with no malicious operations observed. No network communications, data exfiltration, or system harm mechanisms are present. All code appears consistent with legitimate cookie management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of utilities for cookie management in the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles cookies safely and as expected for HTTP request processing, with no anomalous or suspicious code patterns.",
