  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reported purpose, and the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides compatibility utilities for cookie handling in requests, including extraction, creation, and management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code performs standard cookie management tasks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's purpose. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on compatibility utilities and cookie conversion.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for cookie handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) remains reasonable given the utility nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on cookie extraction, setting, and merging.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or backdoors detected. The code interacts with HTTP headers and cookies in expected ways.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie extraction, deletion, and conversion.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns or suspicious code. The code handles cookies safely.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities for cookie handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The code is standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified given the utility nature of the code, which handles cookies but does not perform network or system operations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Low, primarily due to the code's role in cookie handling, which could be exploited if misused, but no such issues are evident here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a legitimate utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
