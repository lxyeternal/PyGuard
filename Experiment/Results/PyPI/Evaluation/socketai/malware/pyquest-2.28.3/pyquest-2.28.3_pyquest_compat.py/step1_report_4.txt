{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility shims for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing imports for dependencies such as 'chardet', 'json', and various URL and cookie handling functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', 'json', 'simplejson', 'sys', and various standard library modules such as 'collections', 'http', 'io', and 'urllib'.",
  "sinks": "None of the import statements are sinks; they merely load modules. No execution of untrusted data or sensitive operations occurs here.",
  "flows": "The code flows through import resolution, conditional imports, and compatibility assignments without any untrusted data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and focused on compatibility and import handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles import compatibility for Python 2 and 3, with fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies like 'chardet' and 'simplejson'. It also sets up type aliases and compatibility flags. The use of try-except for optional imports is standard and safe. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code does not process any user input, network data, or execute dynamic code. It is a typical compatibility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim for supporting multiple Python versions and optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and benign.",
