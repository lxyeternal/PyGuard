{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for Python 2 and 3, mainly handling module imports and type definitions.",
  "sources": "System modules (sys, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request). External package 'chardet' (optional).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks that would cause security concerns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports with fallbacks for compatibility. It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', detects Python version, imports JSON or simplejson, and defines type aliases. All operations are standard for compatibility modules. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The import logic and variable definitions are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply manages imports and type definitions without processing sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
