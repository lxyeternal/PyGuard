  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code performs standard compatibility imports and handling, which is typical for a package maintaining cross-version support.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility issues for different Python versions and optional dependencies. It uses straightforward try-except blocks for imports and version checks to assign flags. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. All imported modules are standard or widely used third-party libraries. No external data sources or network interactions are involved. The structure and content indicate typical compatibility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard compatibility layer for the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages imports and version compatibility, following best practices for such tasks.",
