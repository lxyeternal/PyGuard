{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues across different Python versions and manages imports for JSON handling and HTTP utilities, primarily to support the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, import errors for chardet and simplejson, standard library modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that process untrusted input or data; the code mainly performs imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets up environment compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code performs standard compatibility imports and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules conditionally based on availability, manages version differences (Python 2 vs 3), and defines some compatibility variables. All operations are standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, unsafe input handling, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for handling differences between Python versions and optional imports. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are detected. The module's purpose appears legitimate and safe.",
