  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, manages fallback imports for certain modules, and defines some compatibility aliases and constants.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns observed. The code is primarily compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import handling, version checks, and compatibility assignments. It uses try-except blocks to conditionally import modules. No dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or network activity is present. The code does not contain any backdoors, credential handling, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a typical compatibility shim for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer without any malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious patterns are present.",
