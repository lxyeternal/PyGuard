  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for handling import issues and version differences between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, try-except blocks for optional dependencies, and alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version checks do not process untrusted data; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility shim that manages imports, version detection, and defines aliases for cross-version support. It uses straightforward try-except blocks and version info checks, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is well-understood and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
