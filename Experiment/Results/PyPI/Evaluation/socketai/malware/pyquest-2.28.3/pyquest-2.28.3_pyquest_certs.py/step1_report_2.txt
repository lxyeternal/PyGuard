  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly for use in configuring HTTPS requests.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, called in the main block to output the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where()' function, which is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "User runs the script, which calls 'where()' from certifi, then prints the returned path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code simply outputs a standard certificate bundle location with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other suspicious activities. The code is straightforward, intended for configuration or informational purposes. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is that it relies on certifi, a common and trusted package, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to display the CA bundle path from certifi. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is safe and standard in functionality.",
