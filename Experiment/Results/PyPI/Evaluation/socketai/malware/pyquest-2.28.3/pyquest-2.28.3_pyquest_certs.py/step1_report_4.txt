  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only prints a static path retrieved from a trusted library.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code simply outputs the path returned by 'where()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no unusual or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function to locate CA certificates and prints the path when run directly. It contains no user input, no external data sources, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. Its purpose is purely to output a known static resource location.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for displaying the CA bundle path and does not contain any malicious behavior. It is safe and serves a legitimate purpose.",
