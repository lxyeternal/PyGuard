{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly for use in establishing secure connections.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' library.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path and outputs it directly via print(), with no external data input or influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with a simple function call and output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed as a script. There is no data input, no external network communication, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The purpose aligns with providing CA bundle info, typical in HTTP request contexts. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely to output the path to the default CA bundle provided by 'certifi'. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
