  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The certifi.where() function call which retrieves the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The script calls certifi.where() and outputs the result directly to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only performs a simple function.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the certifi package and outputs the path to its CA bundle when executed. The code is minimal, with no user input, data processing, or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or obfuscated code present. Its purpose appears to be providing configuration information for packaging or environment setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply outputs the certifi CA bundle path and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is a benign utility script with no security concerns.",
