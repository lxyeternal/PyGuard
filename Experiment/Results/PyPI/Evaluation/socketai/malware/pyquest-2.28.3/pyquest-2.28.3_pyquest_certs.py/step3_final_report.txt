{
  "purpose": "Returns the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi', executed when the script runs directly.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints a trusted resource path without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> print(where()) when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and performs a benign operation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted function to retrieve the CA bundle path and prints it. It contains no user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The purpose is purely informational. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code relies on a well-established package, and its operation is transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
