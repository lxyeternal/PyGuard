{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle path from the certifi package, primarily for use in requests or packaging environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to the console.",
  "flows": "Code imports 'where' from 'certifi' -> executes 'print(where())' to output the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward function without unusual constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi' and prints the path to the CA bundle. It is a simple utility script with no user input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no obfuscation. The purpose appears to be to inform the user of the CA bundle location, which is a common, benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from the 'certifi' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the code.",
