  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim with no evidence of malicious intent. Its module remapping is unusual but benign, primarily serving to maintain package structure. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. The scores across reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments reflecting the unconventional module handling."
