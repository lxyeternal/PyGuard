  "purpose": "Declare package metadata for the 'pyquest' Python library.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments defining metadata such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this code solely assigns static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments at the beginning, which are harmless and often used for branding; no suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining static metadata variables for the package. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. The ASCII art comment is benign and used for visual branding. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activities are observed. The code follows typical conventions for Python package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely informational, defining package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe and standard for Python package setup files.",
