  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'pyquest' Python library.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables that assign strings and numeric values, such as __title__, __description__, __url__, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no functions or external calls that handle untrusted input or perform critical operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the metadata appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and some Unicode characters. There are no functions, input handling, external calls, or complex logic. The content appears to be typical package metadata without obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set package metadata for distribution. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
