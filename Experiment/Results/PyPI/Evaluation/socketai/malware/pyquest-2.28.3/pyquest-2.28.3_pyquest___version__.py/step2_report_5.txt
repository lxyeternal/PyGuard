  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the findings against the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata.\n- No input, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- ASCII art comment is benign and for branding.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Metadata definition\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious content, straightforward constants.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Package metadata declaration\n- **Findings:** Static strings, no untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No problems.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Metadata assignment\n- **Findings:** Static variables, typical for package info.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration with ASCII art comment\n- **Findings:** ASCII art is harmless; no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Package metadata\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check of Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since the code is purely static metadata with no dynamic or external code, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for Python package metadata. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the content of the code.",
