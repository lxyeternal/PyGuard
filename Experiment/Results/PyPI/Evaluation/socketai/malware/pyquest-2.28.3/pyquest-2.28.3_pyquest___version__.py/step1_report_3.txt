  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected; code appears to be straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to module-level variables, which is typical for package metadata files. All values are hardcoded and do not involve user input, external data, or dynamic execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of static metadata definitions for the package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It appears to be a normal, benign __init__.py or metadata file.",
