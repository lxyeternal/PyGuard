{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata variables for the 'pyquest' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments at the module level, including string and numeric literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static assignments with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the ASCII art comment is benign and commonly used for branding purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of static metadata variables defining package information. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All signs point to benign, static content typical of a Python package's metadata file. The ASCII art comment is harmless and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified by the evidence. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
