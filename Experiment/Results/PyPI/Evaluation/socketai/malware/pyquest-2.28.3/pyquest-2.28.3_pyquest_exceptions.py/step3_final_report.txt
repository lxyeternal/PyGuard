{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the requests library, but contains embedded obfuscated code that executes during import, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), located in the __import__ block.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded code, which could run arbitrary malicious payloads such as system commands or data exfiltration scripts.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, decodes a base64 string, compiles it, and executes it during module import, enabling potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64 decoding and exec() call embedded within standard exception class definitions; the code executes automatically upon import, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily consists of standard exception class definitions for the requests library. Embedded within is obfuscated code that decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec(), a common malware tactic to hide malicious payloads. The obfuscated code is triggered during import, posing a high security risk. The rest of the code appears benign, but the embedded obfuscated segment is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: near 1, obfuscated: 1, security risk: near 1) are justified given the malicious potential of executing arbitrary code during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded obfuscated code that, if decoded and executed, could perform malicious actions such as remote code execution or data theft. The presence of such code in a core library module indicates a serious security breach. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate. Immediate investigation and removal are recommended.",
