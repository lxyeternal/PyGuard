  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and connection-related errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements: urllib3.exceptions, .compat.JSONDecodeError; inline obfuscated code segment that decodes and executes base64-encoded malicious script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code via exec, potentially executing malicious payload; attribute access and error handling do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated code: base64 decode -> compile -> execute; other exception classes do not process untrusted data or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code that decodes and executes a base64-encoded string from a non-obvious source, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The rest of the code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard exception class definitions used in the requests library, which are not inherently malicious. However, there is a clearly malicious code segment embedded within the file: an obfuscated block that decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec. This behavior indicates an attempt to conceal malicious payload execution. All other parts of the code are normal exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated code appears intentionally hidden, which is highly suspicious. The rest of the code is boilerplate exception handling for a HTTP request library.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload executed through obfuscated base64 decoding and dynamic execution. This indicates a high probability of malicious intent. The remainder of the code is standard request exception class definitions and does not contribute to malicious activity.",
