  "purpose": "This code provides a Python HTTP library 'Requests' for making HTTP requests, handling dependencies, compatibility checks, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, compatibility assertions, dependency imports, and warnings configuration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; primarily performs dependency validation and warning management.",
  "flows": "Imports and dependency checks occur at startup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive version and dependency validation, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles dependency imports, version compatibility checks, warnings configuration, and setup for the requests library. No input or untrusted data sources are processed, and no network connections are initiated outside standard requests functions. All version assertions are safe assertions for dependencies, not related to malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears standard, well-structured, and intended for library setup. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python HTTP library with dependency management and warning configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
