  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and SSL fallback mechanisms for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Version variables from imported libraries, environment variables used in assertions, SSL module import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network activity, no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Version variables are checked via assertions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for version checks could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously manipulated, but this is a common pattern in dependency validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version assertions, SSL fallback injection, and warning configurations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The assertions are standard for dependency validation but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set, which is unlikely in typical use. No obfuscation or malicious network activity is detected. The security risk score should be low, with a slight increase due to reliance on assertions, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup module for a Python HTTP library, performing dependency checks and environment configuration without malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
