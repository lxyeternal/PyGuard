      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The silent error handling and suspicious comment reinforce malicious intent. Scores should reflect this high risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.9, and overall security risk also at 0.9."
