{
  "purpose": "Detects execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory 'tahg' and executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or exfiltrating data.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, runs the encoded PowerShell payload -> silently continues to setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated (Base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently with hidden window flags; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; conditional execution based on directory existence.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a conditional, silent execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, which is suspicious. The payload is encoded to conceal its purpose, and error handling is broad, hiding failures. This pattern is typical in supply chain attacks or backdoors. The setup process appears normal but is exploited as a vector for malicious code. The obfuscation level and stealthy execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package installation. The high obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution indicate malicious or backdoor behavior. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until payload decoding and further analysis confirm its intent.",
