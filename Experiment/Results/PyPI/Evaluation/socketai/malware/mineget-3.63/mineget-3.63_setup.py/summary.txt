  "conclusion": "The code embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package installation. The high obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution indicate malicious or backdoor behavior. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until payload decoding and further analysis confirm its intent."
