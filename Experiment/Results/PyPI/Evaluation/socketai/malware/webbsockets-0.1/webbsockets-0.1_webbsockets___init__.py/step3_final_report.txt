  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security for an open source Python dependency based on provided code or reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based solely on report descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports indicate missing code, so no suspicious patterns can be observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code, leading to no analysis of malicious behavior. Malware scores are appropriately zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and security risk scores are minimal or zero. Slight overconfidence in Report 3's confidence score (0.5) is noted; reducing it to around 0.2-0.3 aligns better with the lack of evidence. Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious, reflecting the missing data.",
  "conclusion": "Given no code is present, all reports correctly conclude that no malicious activity or security issues can be identified. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to confidence levels in some reports to better match the evidence. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is found, and security risks are minimal.",
