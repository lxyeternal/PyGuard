  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without the actual code content, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input data could be read from user input, environment variables, or external files; however, no specific sources are identifiable without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code; no explicit sinks can be identified without the code.",

  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code are identifiable in the absence of the code content. The description does not suggest unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of provided code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The initial review indicates no obvious malicious patterns or security issues based solely on the structure of the prompt.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of actual code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or undetermined due to insufficient information.",
