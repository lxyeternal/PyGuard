  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicative of potential malware or malicious activity. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified based on the obfuscated payload, silent execution, and concealment tactics. Further decoding of the command is recommended for definitive analysis, but the current evidence warrants treating the package as potentially malicious."
