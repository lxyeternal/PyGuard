  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The use of encoded commands, stealth flags, and potential external resource access warrants a malware score of 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.8. Further decoding of the payload is necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence strongly suggests malicious intent."
