  "purpose": "A trivial Python script defining and calling a function that prints 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, environment variables, or data flows; the code only contains a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output effects; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a simple print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints a static message 'installed' and calls it immediately. It is a straightforward, static script with no external inputs, network activity, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
