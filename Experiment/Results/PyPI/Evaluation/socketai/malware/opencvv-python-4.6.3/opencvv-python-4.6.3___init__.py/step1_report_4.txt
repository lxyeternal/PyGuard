  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function 'ina' that prints a message indicating installation, then calls the function.",
  "sources": "The function does not read any external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to the console, but this is not a sink that leads to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No external data sources are read; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function definition that prints a message, followed by an invocation of that function. There are no input handling, external data reads, or network operations. It is very minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no malicious intent. It performs a basic print operation with no security risks or suspicious behavior.",
