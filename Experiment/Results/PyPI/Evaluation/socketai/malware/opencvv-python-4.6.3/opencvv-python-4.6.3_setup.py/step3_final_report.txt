{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads external URLs for downloading executable files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers; execution of downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> HTTP GET request; Downloaded file -> os.system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling; downloading and executing remote payload during setup; hardcoded URLs; exfiltration of system info.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment info and exfiltrates it via a GET request. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it silently, all during package installation. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors. These behaviors match typical malware patterns, indicating malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and uses external URLs known for suspicious activity. The activities are clearly malicious, involving data theft and remote code execution, with no benign explanation. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks and malware distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits explicit malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution during installation. The malicious activities are well-supported by the code structure and behavior. The scores should reflect maximum malicious intent and high security risk.",
