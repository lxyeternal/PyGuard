{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'opencvv-python' with custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetching remote URL, downloading and executing a file from a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded file via 'os.system', sending data to an external URL with environment info.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request to 'linkedopports.com' -> Downloaded executable from 'python-release.com' -> Execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except without handling errors, fetching and executing remote code during installation, dynamic URL and filename, unsolicited data transmission, executing external executable.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and other libraries, then defines a 'send' function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes a GET request to a suspicious domain. It also downloads an executable from a questionable URL and runs it using 'os.system'. This operation occurs during the installation process via a custom 'PostInstallCommand' class. The code aims to transmit the environment name and execute potentially malicious code during package installation, indicating malicious intent and suspicious behavior. No legitimate purpose for such behavior is apparent, and it appears designed to compromise the host system or exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior such as transmitting system info and executing remote files during package installation, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. It should be considered unsafe for use.",
