{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'opencvv-python' package with a post-installation step that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and download URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a downloaded executable, and network requests sending environment info.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via GET request, then a script is downloaded and executed based on the platform.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves environment data, contacts external URLs, and executes a downloaded file silently, which is suspicious behavior. The download URL points to a script with a potentially malicious intent. The use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to an external server. It also downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious URL if running on Windows. This behavior resembles malware due to data exfiltration and remote code execution. The 'PostInstallCommand' class ensures this malicious behavior occurs post-installation. The overall code structure attempts to disguise malicious intent within a setup script, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior including data exfiltration and remote code execution, indicating a high risk. It appears designed to secretly send system information and run untrusted code after installation, constituting malicious activity.",
