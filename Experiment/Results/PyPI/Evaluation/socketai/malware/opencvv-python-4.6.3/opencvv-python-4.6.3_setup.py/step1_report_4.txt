  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also performs post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs via requests.get, os.system call to execute downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a potentially downloaded executable, network requests to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> request to 'https://linkedopports.com/...'; URL request -> download executable -> execute via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Code downloads and executes an external executable during installation, uses broad exception handling, and sends environment info to a suspicious URL.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It also downloads an executable from a domain 'python-release.com' and executes it without user consent or verification, which indicates potentially malicious behavior. The use of os.system to run the downloaded file, combined with network requests to external sites and environment data transmission, are suspicious actions commonly associated with malware or malicious payload delivery. The code is embedded within a setup script, which could trick users into unknowingly executing malicious code during package installation. No obfuscation is present, but the behavior itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation and exfiltrating environment data. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
