{
  "purpose": "To create a Python package that, upon installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to '104.248.19.57' on port 3334 during the custom install step.",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 calls redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawning a shell with pty.spawn('/bin/sh').",
  "flows": "During installation, socket connects to remote server -> file descriptors are duplicated to redirect I/O -> a shell is spawned, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The setup script includes code that initiates a network connection and opens a shell during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, when run, connects to a specific IP address and port, then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket, and spawns a shell. This behavior effectively creates a reverse shell, allowing remote control of the host system. The code is embedded within the setup script, which is executed during package installation, indicating malicious intent. No legitimate setup functions require such behavior, confirming malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell during installation. It is highly suspicious and should not be used or trusted.",
