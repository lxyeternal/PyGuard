  "purpose": "Custom installation script that exfiltrates a shell to a remote server upon package installation.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to external IP address during installation.",
  "sinks": "Spawned shell over network, duplicated file descriptors for stdin, stdout, stderr.",
  "flows": "During installation, connects to remote IP and spawns a shell, potentially allowing remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port, immediate socket connection during install, spawning a shell with network redirection.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'run' method of the install command, establishing a socket connection to a specified IP address and port. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a shell (/bin/sh). This behavior is suspicious because it enables remote control of the machine during package installation, which is a typical characteristic of malicious code. No other legitimate setup purpose is evident, and no user interaction is handled. The code does not utilize any of the imported modules for legitimate purposes in the context of setup. The hardcoded IP address and port strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the context of data exfiltration or remote control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and appears malicious, implementing a covert remote shell activation during package installation. It does not serve a legitimate purpose related to setup or package management and resembles a backdoor or exfiltration mechanism.",
