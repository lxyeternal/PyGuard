  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during package installation, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The behavior is explicit, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's actions."
