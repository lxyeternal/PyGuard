  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, user input, network connections, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, subprocess execution, potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment/user sources flows into network connections, subprocesses, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs/domains, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, unclear variable naming, inconsistent documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple suspicious behaviors including dynamic code execution, hardcoded malicious endpoints, and obfuscation patterns. These behaviors suggest potential backdoors, data exfiltration, or command injection. The use of eval/exec combined with network activity and obfuscation increases the likelihood of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0.65, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.8, confidence=0.75) are justified by these indicators. The absence of code in other reports justifies their low scores and confidence levels.",
  "conclusion": "The code likely contains malicious behaviors, especially in report 5, with high suspicion supported by multiple indicators. The overall security risk is high, and further code review or analysis is recommended to confirm malicious activity.",
