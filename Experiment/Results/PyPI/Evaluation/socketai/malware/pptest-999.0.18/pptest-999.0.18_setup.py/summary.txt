  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behaviors, including covert data exfiltration via DNS, system info gathering, and system file manipulation. The high malware score (0.9) and security risk score (0.9) are justified. The obfuscation score (0.2) is appropriate given the code's straightforward encoding. Overall, this code should be flagged as malicious and reviewed for removal or further investigation."
