  "purpose": "Detects potential malicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command when a certain directory is missing.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> triggers subprocess call -> executes encoded PowerShell payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW', broad try-except blocks suppressing errors, embedded URL in comments.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess when 'tahg' does not exist. The command is base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation, and is likely malicious given the embedded URL and silent execution. The setup() call is standard and wrapped in try-except, which suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The use of encoded commands and hidden execution points to malicious intent, consistent with tactics used in malware delivery. The high obfuscation and suspicious URL support a high malware and security risk score. The broad exception handling further conceals potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code that executes silently, indicating high likelihood of malicious activity. The embedded PowerShell command and URL suggest remote payload delivery or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms benign intent.",
