      "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code that executes silently, indicating high likelihood of malicious activity. The embedded PowerShell command and URL suggest remote payload delivery or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms benign intent."
