  "purpose": "Execute package setup for 'httpmine' and conditionally run a hidden, encoded PowerShell command if 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor establishment.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; if condition met, encoded command runs silently in hidden window, potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command run in hidden mode; broad try-except blocks silently suppress errors; execution during package setup is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup but includes a conditional, silent execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during installation. The command is encoded, run with hidden window flags, and the exception handling is broad, which can conceal errors or malicious failures. The suspicious behavior—obfuscated, hidden execution—aligns with common tactics in malicious packages. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.85) are justified given the evidence. Without decoding the payload, certainty about malicious intent cannot be absolute, but the pattern strongly suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, representing a significant security risk. The package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious pending further analysis of the payload.",
