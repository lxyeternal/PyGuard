  "flows": "hostname used to construct URL -> HTTP GET request -> response text executed via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically executing code retrieved from an external URL without validation, potential remote code execution risk.",
  "analysis": "The code imports socket to get the current hostname and constructs a URL incorporating this hostname. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL using requests, and executes the retrieved code directly with exec(). This pattern is highly suspicious because executing remotely fetched code without validation or sandboxing can lead to arbitrary code execution, remote command injection, or malicious payloads. The absence of any validation, sanitization, or authentication mechanisms further increases the risk. There are no other obfuscated parts or hidden behaviors; the main concern is the remote code execution via exec() based on external content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is potentially malicious as it executes remote code dynamically without validation, posing a high security risk. It is highly likely to be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors, remote control, or other harmful actions.",
