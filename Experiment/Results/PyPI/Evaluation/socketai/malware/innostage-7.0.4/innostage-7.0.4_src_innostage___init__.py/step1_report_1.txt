  "purpose": "Retrieve the hostname, construct a URL with it, fetch code from that URL, and execute it dynamically.",
  "sources": "The hostname via socket.gethostname(), the URL constructed with the hostname, and the content fetched from that URL.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing arbitrary code fetched over the network.",
  "flows": "hostname -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request -> fetched code -> exec() execution.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic execution of code retrieved over the network without validation; use of exec() on external input poses high risk.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the system's hostname and appends it to a specific URL. It then performs an HTTP GET request to fetch code from that URL. The fetched code is executed directly with exec(), which is highly dangerous as it can run any arbitrary code supplied by the server. There are no checks, validation, or sandboxing, making this setup potentially malicious or backdoored. The use of exec() with external data is a critical security concern, especially since the content source is controlled externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches and executes external code dynamically without validation, representing a high security risk. It could be used to run malicious code on the host system, indicating malicious intent.",
