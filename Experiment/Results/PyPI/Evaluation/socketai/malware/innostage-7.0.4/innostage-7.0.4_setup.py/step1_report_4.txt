{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'innostage', reads dependencies from a 'Pipfile.lock', and installs them during setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getenv), network requests via requests.get, and reads a JSON file ('Pipfile.lock') from disk.",
  "sinks": "The network request (`requests.get(url_check)`) executes code dynamically via `exec()` on the response text, which could lead to code injection. Reading environment variables may expose sensitive data if used improperly, but not necessarily malicious here.",
  "flows": "The code fetches a URL based on the hostname, executes code from the URL's response (`exec()`), then reads a local JSON file and returns dependencies. These dependencies are used in `install_requires`.",
  "anomalies": "The key anomaly is executing arbitrary code fetched from an external URL (`exec()` on network response). The URL includes the hostname, potentially for tracking or malicious updates. Use of `exec()` on external data is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup process, but introduces a significant security risk by executing code fetched over HTTP without validation. The external URL 'http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/' + hostname may deliver malicious code, leading to remote code execution. The reading of dependencies from 'Pipfile.lock' is typical, but combined with the unsafe exec call, this could allow remote command execution during package setup. No hardcoded credentials are present. The environment variable is used for versioning and not sensitive data. The overall flow indicates malicious potential due to the `exec()` of external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-security risk due to executing arbitrary code from an external URL during setup. This constitutes a supply chain attack vector and could lead to remote code execution on systems installing this package. The presence of `exec()` on untrusted network data is a critical security concern.",
