{
  "purpose": "The code fetches remote code from a URL constructed with the hostname and executes it directly, during package setup, to determine dependencies.",
  "sources": "The URL 'http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/' + socket.gethostname(), fetched via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "The fetched code content executed with exec()",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code from remote URL -> exec() executes the remote code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on remote content without validation, broad try/except hiding errors, URL constructed with hostname for potential tracking or malicious payload delivery",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL using the hostname, fetches code via requests, and executes it with exec() without validation. This pattern enables remote code execution, a severe security vulnerability. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The dependencies are read from a local Pipfile.lock, but the remote code execution introduces a critical supply chain risk. All reports correctly identify this pattern as malicious, assigning high malware (0.9) and security risk (0.9) scores, justified by the severity of executing arbitrary remote code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through remote code execution, representing a severe security vulnerability and supply chain attack vector. The high scores are justified, and the pattern should be considered highly dangerous. Immediate review and removal are recommended.",
