{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, user, current directory), encodes it into JSON, then hex, splits into chunks, and sends DNS requests embedding this data during package setup routines (install, develop, egg_info). The purpose claimed is research and non-malicious testing.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - data sources for system info; json.dumps() and encoding functions for data serialization.",
  "sinks": "socket.sendto() over UDP sockets, transmitting crafted DNS query names to a specified domain, potentially leaking data covertly.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, serialized into JSON, encoded into hex, split into chunks, then embedded into DNS query subdomains, and sent via DNS requests during setup commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by embedding system info into DNS queries during package installation routines, which is suspicious despite the research claim.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs DNS packets manually and sends system info during setup commands, indicating covert data transfer. No hardcoded credentials or destructive payloads are present. The behavior resembles malicious exfiltration techniques. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The network activity during installation routines is unusual and potentially malicious. The technical implementation is correct, and the signals point toward covert data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Although the package claims to be for research and non-malicious purposes, its behavior of covertly transmitting system information via DNS during setup routines strongly suggests malicious intent or at least high security risk. The technique is characteristic of malware used for data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, but given the high suspicion, the malware score should be elevated to reflect the malicious potential.",
