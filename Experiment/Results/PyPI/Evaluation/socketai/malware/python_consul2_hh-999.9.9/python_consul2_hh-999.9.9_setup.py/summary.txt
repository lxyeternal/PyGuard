  "conclusion": "Although the package claims to be for research and non-malicious purposes, its behavior of covertly transmitting system information via DNS during setup routines strongly suggests malicious intent or at least high security risk. The technique is characteristic of malware used for data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate, but given the high suspicion, the malware score should be elevated to reflect the malicious potential."
