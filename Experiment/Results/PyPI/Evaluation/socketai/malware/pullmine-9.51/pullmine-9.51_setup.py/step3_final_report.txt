{
  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command; package setup data.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command; silent subprocess creation; error suppression blocks.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess execution if 'tahg' is missing; subprocess runs encoded command with hidden window; errors suppressed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; use of broad try-except blocks hiding errors; stealthy process creation flags.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess with hidden window and suppressed errors. The setup() call is wrapped in try-except, hiding potential failures. The encoded command's obfuscation and stealthy execution strongly suggest malicious intent, typical of payload delivery or system compromise tactics. The high scores assigned in reports (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are justified by these indicators, with the stealth and obfuscation techniques indicating high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload execution during package setup, with stealthy parameters and error suppression, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised pending further decoding of the payload.",
