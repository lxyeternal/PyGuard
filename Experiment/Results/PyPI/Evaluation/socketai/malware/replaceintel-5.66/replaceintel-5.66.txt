      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, representing a significant security threat. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. This pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics, and the code should be treated as malicious until further analysis of the payload is performed."
