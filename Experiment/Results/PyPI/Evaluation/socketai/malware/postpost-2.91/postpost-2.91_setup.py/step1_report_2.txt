  "flows": "os.path.exists('tahg') check -> subprocess.Popen executes encoded PowerShell command if condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command that appears to be malicious or obfuscated. The code attempts to run hidden commands potentially without user awareness. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding failures.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core. It then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. If a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, it executes an encoded PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, which is suspicious as the command is encoded, likely to hide malicious intent. The setup() function defines package metadata for 'postpost' and is wrapped in a try-except, suppressing errors. The combination of obfuscated command execution and silent error handling suggests malicious activity, such as executing hidden or malicious PowerShell scripts during package installation. No other malicious behavior, like data exfiltration or hardcoded credentials, is directly visible but the obfuscated PowerShell command is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden PowerShell command executed during setup if a file does not exist, which is a strong indicator of malicious or sabotage behavior. The script suppresses errors, hiding potential failures. The package's primary setup appears legitimate but is compromised by the embedded obfuscated malicious code.",
