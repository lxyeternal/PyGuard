  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating likely malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth execution, and conditional trigger suggest sabotage or payload delivery. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis (e.g., decoding the command) confirms its intent."
