  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL 'https://api64.ipify.org?format=json' to get the IP address; POST request to 'https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com' to send data; socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to remote server with collected system info",
  "flows": "System info is collected via get_originating_ip() and socket/os calls, then sent directly via send_data_to_server() to the external URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and transmits potentially sensitive system data (public IP, hostname, current directory) during installation without user consent; no clear documentation or warning provided",
  "analysis": "The CustomInstallCommand class overrides the run() method to gather system details: external IP address via requests.get(), hostname via socket, current directory via os.getcwd(). It then sends this data to a remote server through a POST request, potentially executing during package installation. This behavior is hidden within the setup script, which is unusual for typical package installs. The server URL is hardcoded and the data collection occurs automatically, indicating possible privacy invasion or malicious tracking. No user notification or opt-out mechanism is present. The code appears to perform data exfiltration without user knowledge, which can be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs hidden collection and transmission of system information during package installation, indicating potentially malicious privacy-invasive behavior. It is a security concern due to unauthorized data exfiltration, with no apparent user consent or transparency.",
