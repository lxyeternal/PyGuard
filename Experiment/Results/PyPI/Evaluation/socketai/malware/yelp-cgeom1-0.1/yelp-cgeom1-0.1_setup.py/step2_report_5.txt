  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code exfiltrates system info during install without user consent, sending data to a suspicious URL.  \n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No significant errors; the reasoning aligns with the code.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0.9, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9.  \n  These seem reasonable given the behavior.  \n- **Justification for high scores?**  \n  The activity is covert, involves external data exfiltration, and is highly suspicious.  \n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code's purpose is clearly malicious or privacy-invasive, justifying near-max malware score.  \n- **Overall:**  \n  The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Yes. Similar to report 1, with exfiltration during install.  \n- **Errors?**  \n  No.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0.75, SecurityRisk: 0.8.  \n  Slightly lower than report 1, which is acceptable, given similar behavior.  \n- **Justification:**  \n  The behavior is malicious, but perhaps slightly less severe than report 1, hence the score of 0.75.  \n- **Overall:**  \n  The scores are reasonable.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Yes. Same pattern of data exfiltration during install.  \n- **Errors?**  \n  No.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 1.  \n  These are appropriate given the aggressive malicious activity.  \n- **Justification:**  \n  Complete exfiltration without user consent, suspicious URL, and high confidence.  \n- **Overall:**  \n  Scores are justified.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Yes. Similar behavior.  \n- **Errors?**  \n  No.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0.7, SecurityRisk: 0.75.  \n  Slightly lower than previous, reflecting perhaps less severity or confidence.  \n- **Justification:**  \n  Still malicious, but perhaps less aggressive or less certain.  \n- **Overall:**  \n  Reasonable.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Yes. Same pattern.  \n- **Errors?**  \n  No.  \n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0.75, SecurityRisk: 0.8.  \n  Consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Overall:**  \n  Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify malicious exfiltration during setup, with consistent reasoning.\n- The scores are generally aligned with the severity of behavior.\n- The malware scores are high, reflecting malicious intent, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code performs covert data exfiltration during installation, with no user notification.\n- The external server URL is suspicious.\n- The behavior is highly malicious and privacy-invasive.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.9 (consistent with the reports, slightly more confident due to clear exfiltration)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.9 (high, due to privacy violation and potential malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in identifying malicious behavior. The scores are reasonable and justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis package exhibits serious malicious activity—covert data exfiltration during installation—requiring immediate removal and further investigation.",
