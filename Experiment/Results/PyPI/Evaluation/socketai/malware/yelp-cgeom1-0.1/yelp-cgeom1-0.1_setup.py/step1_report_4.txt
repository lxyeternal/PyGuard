{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (`https://api64.ipify.org?format=json` and `https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com`), socket information (hostname), and current directory via `os.getcwd()`.",
  "sinks": "The `requests.post()` call sends data to the specified server URL, potentially transmitting collected system info to an external entity.",
  "flows": "The `run()` method gathers system info, then calls `send_data_to_server()` to transmit it. The data flow is from source (system info collection) to sink (HTTP POST request).",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and transmits potentially sensitive system data (IP address, hostname, current directory) during package installation without user consent or notification. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but the behavior is suspicious for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the `install` command in setuptools to collect system information (public IP, hostname, current directory). It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a remote server during the installation process. This behavior could be used for tracking, monitoring, or exfiltration without user awareness. The remote server URL appears obscure, possibly to evade detection. The rest of the setup code appears standard and does not contain other suspicious elements. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs apart from the hidden data transmission during install.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes potentially malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The rest of the code is standard setup code with no other suspicious elements.",
