{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup command that, during installation, collects system information (external IP, hostname, current directory) and exfiltrates it to a suspicious external server, without user consent, indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org?format=json' for IP, socket.gethostname() for hostname, os.getcwd() for current directory, and the hardcoded server URL for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() call sending data to the external server, which transmits potentially sensitive system info outside the user's control.",
  "flows": "Source functions (get_originating_ip, socket.gethostname, os.getcwd) collect data; this data flows into send_data_to_server() which transmits it via HTTP POST to the hardcoded URL during the run() method of the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "Covert data collection during package installation without user notification, sending data to a suspicious, hardcoded server URL, with no opt-out or transparency; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection (IP, hostname, current directory) during package installation and exfiltrates this data to an external server, indicating malicious intent. The server URL is suspicious, and the activity is privacy-invasive. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the behavior is covert. All reports correctly identify this malicious activity, assigning high malware and security risk scores (near 1.0), justified by the privacy violation and covert exfiltration. The activity aligns with supply chain attack patterns or privacy breaches. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the clarity of behavior and lack of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, with high security and malware risk scores justified by the privacy invasion and suspicious server communication. All reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
