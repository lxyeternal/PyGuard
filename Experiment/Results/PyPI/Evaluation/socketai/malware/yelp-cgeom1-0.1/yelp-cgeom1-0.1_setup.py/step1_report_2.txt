  "purpose": "The code customizes the setup installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org?format=json' to get IP address; POST request to 'https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com' to send data; reading hostname, current directory, and network info.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST to an external server; printing output messages.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> Sends data via HTTP POST to external server during install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive system data and exfiltrates it without user consent during package installation; uses a suspicious external server domain; no user prompt or disclaimer; sends hostname, IP, current directory.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the standard setup process by defining a custom install command. During installation, it gathers system information such as the originating IP, hostname, and current working directory. It then attempts to send this data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The data collection and exfiltration happen silently during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a Python package and could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The server URL appears suspicious and unrelated to the package's functionality. No obfuscation or encryption is used; the code runs straightforward requests. There are no apparent data validation or user prompts, making this behavior potentially malicious or privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation to an external server without user consent. It poses privacy and security risks, potentially enabling tracking or data theft.",
