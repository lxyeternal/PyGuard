{
  "purpose": "Customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external IP service (https://api64.ipify.org?format=json), and to the specified server (https://hj4r3z33cahfqit5kmmh1mgn3e95x4lt.oastify.com).",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP POST request with system data to remote server, printing messages based on response status.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (IP, hostname, directory) is gathered and sent via POST request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Data collection during package installation, sending potentially sensitive information (public IP, hostname, current directory) to external server without user consent. Use of hardcoded server URL. No validation or obfuscation of data. The server URL is suspiciously obscure and may be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into the installation process via a custom command class. During installation, it collects system information including external IP, hostname, and current directory. It then attempts to send this data to a remote server over HTTP POST, printing success or error messages. This behavior is not typical for open-source packages and indicates potential malicious intent, such as tracking or data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard server URL and immediate data sending during setup are suspicious. No obfuscation or encryption is used, and no user notification is given about this data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of covertly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or privacy violation. It should be flagged for removal and further review. Overall security risk is high due to data exfiltration, with a malware score close to 1.",
