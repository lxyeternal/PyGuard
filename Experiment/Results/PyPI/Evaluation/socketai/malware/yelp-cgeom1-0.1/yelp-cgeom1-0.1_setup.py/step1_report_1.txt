{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the setup process to collect system information and send it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to external services (https://api64.ipify.org and the specified server) to gather IP address and transmit data; reading system info like hostname and current directory.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to an external server; printing messages to the console.",
  "flows": "Data collected from get_originating_ip() and system info is assembled into a dictionary and sent to the server_url through requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs system info collection and exfiltrates it during package installation without user consent or notification. The server URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious. No user prompts or opt-out mechanisms are present. The module uses setup.py, which is a standard build script, but the side-effect during install is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that executes during package installation, collecting system details such as IP address, hostname, and current directory. It then attempts to send this data to a hardcoded external URL. The use of requests to contact external IP lookup and data exfiltration domains indicates malicious intent or at least intrusive behavior. The code does not inform the user, nor does it provide an option to decline. This behavior is atypical for legitimate package setup scripts and indicates a potential privacy violation and malicious activity. The code appears obfuscated in intent but is straightforward in implementation, with no malicious obfuscation techniques present.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. The activity is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. The code's purpose is covert data collection, making it potentially harmful.",
