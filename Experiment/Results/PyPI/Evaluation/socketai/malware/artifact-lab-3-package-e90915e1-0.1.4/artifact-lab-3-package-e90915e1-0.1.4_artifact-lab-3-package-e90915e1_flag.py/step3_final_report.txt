{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no external dependencies or inputs.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output in a way that could cause leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function that outputs a greeting. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no external data, network activity, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The reasoning in the reports is sound, and their conclusions are justified. Given the absence of any suspicious elements, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores correctly reflect the code's harmless nature. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
