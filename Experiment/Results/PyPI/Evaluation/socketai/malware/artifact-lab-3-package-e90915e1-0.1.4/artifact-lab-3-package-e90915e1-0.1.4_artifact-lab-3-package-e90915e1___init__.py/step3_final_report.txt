  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, anomalies, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code present or code is empty/placeholder; no input or data reading points identified.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data leaks or malicious data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks due to absence of code or benign code with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed; code is missing or non-functional in all reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or emptiness of code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and zero where code is absent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or near-zero) are consistent with the evidence. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall assessment indicates negligible security risk, aligned with the lack of executable or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the package can be considered safe based on the provided code analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
