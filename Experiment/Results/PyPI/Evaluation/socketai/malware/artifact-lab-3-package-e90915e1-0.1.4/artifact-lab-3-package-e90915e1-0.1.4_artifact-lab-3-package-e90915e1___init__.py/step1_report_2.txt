  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script designed for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent based on its visible structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if executed, but none are explicitly visible or invoked in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to variables or functions that may perform further processing or output, but no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors, are detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows that the code performs typical Python operations without any signs of malicious behavior. No dangerous function calls, obfuscated strings, or suspicious imports are present. The code does not contain any network activity, system modifications, or credential harvesting routines. The structure is standard, and no anomalies are detected that would suggest tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears safe, with no security risks identified. The confidence level is high due to the clarity and straightforward nature of the code.",
