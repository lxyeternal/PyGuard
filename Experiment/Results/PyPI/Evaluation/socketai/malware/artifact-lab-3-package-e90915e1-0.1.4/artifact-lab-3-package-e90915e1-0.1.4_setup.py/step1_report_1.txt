  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for a Python package with custom install and develop commands that send environment data to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ, executed during the install/develop process",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to 'https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app' sending URL-encoded environment data",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> urllib.parse.urlencode -> urllib.request.Request -> urllib.request.urlopen to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends sensitive environment data to an external server during installation and development, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules for packaging. It defines a function 'notmalfunc' that encodes all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL. This function is invoked during both the custom 'develop' and 'install' commands, meaning that whenever the package is installed or developed, environment data (potentially sensitive) is transmitted to an external endpoint. The URL appears to be an ngrok tunnel, which is often used to expose local servers and could be suspicious if used for data exfiltration. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or malware behavior, is present beyond this data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The package is designed to exfiltrate environment variables during installation and development processes by sending them to an external server. This behavior is suspicious and could indicate malicious intent or a security breach. The code's core functionality is benign in appearance but includes a significant privacy and security concern due to automated data leakage.",
