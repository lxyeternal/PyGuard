{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and install a Python project, with custom behavior during installation and development.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read via os.environ in the function notmalfunc().",
  "sinks": "The collected environment data is encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent to the specified URL (sink) during post-install or post-develop steps.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is invoked during both install and develop commands, which is unusual. It transmits environment data to an external URL without any explicit user consent or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines custom command classes for install and develop processes. The function notmalfunc() collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via HTTP POST to a specified ngrok URL. This function is called automatically after installation or development setup, potentially leaking environment data to an external server. The URL is hardcoded and appears suspicious, as it is an ngrok endpoint that could be used for malicious data exfiltration. There are no other malicious behaviors such as backdoors, system damage, or covert operations, but the unprompted data transmission raises security and privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting environment variables to an external server during package installation or development. This could be a privacy violation or part of a malicious supply chain attack. No benign purpose for this behavior is evident, and the external URL is suspicious.",
