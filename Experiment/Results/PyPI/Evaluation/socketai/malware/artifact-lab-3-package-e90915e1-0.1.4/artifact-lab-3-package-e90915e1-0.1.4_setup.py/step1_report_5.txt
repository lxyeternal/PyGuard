  "purpose": "Setuptools-based package setup script that modifies install and develop commands to send environment data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() reads environment variables and encodes them for transmission.",
  "sinks": "The urllib.request.urlopen(request) sends the encoded data to a remote URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive environment data.",
  "flows": "The environment variables are collected in notmalfunc(), then encoded and sent via HTTP POST request during package install or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a function (notmalfunc) that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during setup commands, which is unusual and suspicious. The remote URL uses an ngrok domain, indicating a potentially malicious or testing server. No other malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines a function (notmalfunc) that gathers environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a remote URL using an HTTP POST request. This function is invoked during both 'develop' and 'install' commands by overriding the respective classes. The remote URL is an ngrok address, which is commonly used for tunneling and can indicate malicious activity such as data exfiltration. The code does not perform any other actions, but the purpose of exfiltrating environment data suggests malicious intent or at least malicious behavior if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during installation or development setup, which could compromise user or system security. The remote server URL and the context of data exfiltration point to potentially malicious intent.",
