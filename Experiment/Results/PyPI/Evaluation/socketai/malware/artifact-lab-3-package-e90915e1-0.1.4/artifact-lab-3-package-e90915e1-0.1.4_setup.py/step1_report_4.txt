  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that modifies installation and development commands to execute additional code.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc' function called during 'develop' and 'install' commands, which accesses environment variables and sends them via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to a remote URL with environment data, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "On package install or development, 'notmalfunc' gathers environment variables, encodes them, and sends to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: code automatically sends environment data to a remote URL during setup procedures, which is atypical and suspicious. The URL points to an ngrok endpoint, often used for tunneling during testing or potentially malicious exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and overrides 'develop' and 'install' commands to include a function 'notmalfunc'. This function collects all environment variables, encodes them, and makes an HTTP POST request to a specified URL. This behavior occurs automatically during installation or development setup, without user awareness or explicit consent. Sending environment data (which may contain sensitive credentials, tokens, or configuration details) to an external server indicates potential data exfiltration and malicious intent. No other malicious code or obfuscated code is present. The URL is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, possibly for data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates environment data to an external server during package installation or development, which is unusual and indicates potential malicious intent. This could lead to data leakage and compromise user or system security.",
