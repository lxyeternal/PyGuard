{
  "purpose": "The code executes a shell command via os.system() that outputs a message indicating malicious activity, specifically '恶意代码执行成功' (Malicious code executed successfully).",
  "sources": "The function malicious_function() calls os.system() with a static command; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the command, which outputs a message to the system shell; potential for command execution if input were dynamic, but currently static.",
  "flows": "The flow is direct: function call to os.system() execution, leading to output of the malicious message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with a hardcoded message indicating malicious activity; comments hint at potential for additional malicious behaviors; code is straightforward with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that executes a static shell command outputting a malicious message. The command is hardcoded, with no external input or obfuscation. The use of os.system() with a fixed string is a common pattern in malicious scripts. The comments suggest potential for further malicious behaviors, but none are present. The code's simplicity makes malicious intent clear. The analysis confirms the code's malicious nature, with high confidence that it is intentionally harmful. No obfuscation or benign purpose is evident, and the direct execution of a command signaling malicious activity warrants a high malware and risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, executing a command that outputs a message indicating malicious activity. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the comments suggest potential for further malicious actions. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be set to 1 to reflect the clear malicious intent.",
