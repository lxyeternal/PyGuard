{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation hook intended to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The reverse_shell function is called during the install process; it reads hardcoded base64-encoded host and port data, which are decoded at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call are potential sinks where data is sent to or received from external systems, executing a shell with network communication.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers run(), which calls reverse_shell() with hardcoded encoded data; this establishes a network connection and executes a shell, creating a flow from code to external system control.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a reverse shell function activated during post-install, use of hardcoded base64-encoded host and port, which are decoded at runtime. No legitimate functionality justifies these actions. The description explicitly states malicious intent. The code directly executes a system shell after connecting to an external IP.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connecting to a specified external server. It uses base64 encoding to obscure the server address and port. The reverse_shell() function opens a socket, connects to the remote server, redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns an interactive shell. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at remote command execution and system compromise. The use of standard libraries like socket, subprocess, and os to facilitate remote access indicates clear malicious intent. The code’s structure, placement within a package setup script, and explicit comments suggest an attempt to embed malicious functionality within a seemingly legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, when installed, creates a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled server, allowing remote command execution. The use of encoded addresses, automatic execution during installation, and shell spawning confirm malicious intent. It poses a severe security threat if used in a real environment.",
