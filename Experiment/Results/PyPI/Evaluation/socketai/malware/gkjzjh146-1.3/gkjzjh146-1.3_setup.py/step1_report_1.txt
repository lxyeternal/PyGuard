{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup script that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "The reverse_shell function, called during post-install, reads hardcoded base64-encoded host and port values, which are decoded and used to establish a socket connection.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call execute a shell (/bin/sh -i), providing remote control access to the attacker.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code decodes the base64-encoded host and port, creates a socket, connects to the remote server, duplicates socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, and then spawns an interactive shell, effectively giving remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The reverse_shell function is invoked unconditionally during the post-install process, and it uses hardcoded, base64-encoded network parameters. The purpose of the package is labeled as 'malicious,' and the code executes a reverse shell without any user consent or warning.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, when run, initiates a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address and port encoded in base64. The socket is set up to redirect input/output/error streams to the remote connection, and an interactive shell is spawned. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, specifically remote code execution and backdoor installation. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup tasks; its sole purpose appears to be to establish unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains deliberate malicious behavior by executing a reverse shell during package installation, indicating high malicious intent. The package is designed as a backdoor tool, compromising the security of any system that installs it.",
