{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute a reverse shell during package installation, establishing a remote backdoor connection to a hardcoded IP and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded base64-encoded strings for IP and port, and during the run method of the custom install command, it calls reverse_shell() which initiates network communication and spawns a shell.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection and subprocess call act as sinks, enabling remote command execution and control, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "flows": "The source is the decoded IP and port; the flow proceeds through socket connection establishment, file descriptor duplication, and spawning a shell, leading to remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded base64-encoded network parameters, executes a reverse shell during installation without user consent, and is explicitly labeled as malicious in the package description.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that, during installation, runs a reverse shell by decoding base64-encoded IP and port, connecting via socket, redirecting standard IO, and spawning an interactive shell. The behavior is malicious, providing remote control access. The base64 encoding offers minimal obfuscation. All indicators point to intentional malicious activity with high severity. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation beyond base64, and the malicious activity is explicitly triggered during setup, making it a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, executing a reverse shell during package installation, representing a high security threat. The malware score is 1, obfuscation is minimal (around 0.2-0.3), and the security risk score is 1. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
