  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "No concrete code snippets provided; analysis based on summaries indicating minimal or no code content.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable due to lack of code; no data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows can be established without actual code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets limits analysis; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected or indicated.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence or minimal nature of code, leading to low suspicion. Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate given the limited information. Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal threat. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are reported or inferred. The reasoning in each report is cautious and consistent, avoiding overinterpretation of missing data.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent. No further action or adjustments are necessary unless actual code becomes available for review.",
