      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits behaviors consistent with malware, including obfuscation, system modifications, privilege escalation, and covert execution paths. It should be considered malicious, and its use is unsafe without thorough static and dynamic analysis. The malware score is set to 1 due to the high likelihood of malicious intent, and the security risk score is similarly high. The obfuscation score is also high, reflecting the heavy concealment techniques employed."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate obfuscation but no concrete malicious behavior. The supply chain security risk is low, with a slight suspicion due to obfuscation. The code is likely benign but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation is used intentionally to hide malicious code."
