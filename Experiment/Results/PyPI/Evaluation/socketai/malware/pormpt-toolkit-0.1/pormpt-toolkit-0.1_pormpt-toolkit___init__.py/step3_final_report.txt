  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain sabotage, obfuscation, and malicious code patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, subprocess calls",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, subprocess execution, environment variables",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing, dynamic execution, or network transmission",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, misleading variable names, complex control flow, potential hidden malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which could conceal malicious intent. No direct evidence of malware such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system damage was found. The obfuscation score is moderate, and the malware suspicion is cautious. The overall structure appears typical, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. Confidence in malicious activity is low; the primary concern is obfuscation complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate obfuscation but no concrete malicious behavior. The supply chain security risk is low, with a slight suspicion due to obfuscation. The code is likely benign but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation is used intentionally to hide malicious code.",
