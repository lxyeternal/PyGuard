  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some operation, potentially involving data processing or network communication, although the specific function is not explicitly clear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or external files, although specific sources are not explicitly shown in the code snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket or HTTP requests), file write operations, or system commands, but explicit sink points are not clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network communication or file output; exact paths cannot be determined without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are immediately evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are apparent. The code does not include suspicious system calls or hidden behaviors based on the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The review of the code shows standard Python constructs without signs of malicious intent. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal, and no suspicious code patterns are detected. Due to the lack of specific code details, the confidence in detecting malicious behavior is moderate; more context would be necessary for a thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to limited context, a low-confidence assessment is appropriate. No suspicious anomalies or malware signs are observed.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
