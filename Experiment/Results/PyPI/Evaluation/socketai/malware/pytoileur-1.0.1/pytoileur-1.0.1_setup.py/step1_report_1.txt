{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'pytoileur' with specified metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the file system (reading 'README.md'), environment variables, and possibly user input via setup parameters. The obfuscated base64 code may execute additional hidden code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes decoded base64 code which could perform malicious actions such as network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading the README file, then executing the decoded base64 string within the 'try' block before proceeding with setup configuration. The decoded code appears to perform dynamic code execution and potentially malicious network or system activities.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64 encoded string executed via 'exec', which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The code does not clearly specify its purpose and the decoded payload suggests malicious intent. The 'exec' call is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, further obscuring behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. However, it contains an obfuscated base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed at runtime within the 'try' block. This code decodes to a complex script that likely performs dynamic code execution, possibly including network operations or other malicious activities. The execution is hidden behind base64 decoding and suppressed exceptions, which is suspicious. The rest of the setup code appears benign and typical for Python packaging, but the embedded obfuscated code poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious obfuscated code executed during installation, which could perform harmful actions such as code injection or system compromise. Due to the presence of hidden payload and obfuscation, this package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
