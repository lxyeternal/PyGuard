{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package but contains an embedded obfuscated payload executed during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' normally, then decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload via exec() within a try-except block.",
  "sinks": "The decoded payload is executed with exec(), potentially performing malicious system commands, network activity, or code injection.",
  "flows": "The base64 payload is decoded and executed during the setup process, enabling malicious actions during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated base64-encoded code executed via exec(), suppression of errors, complex payload designed to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules like os, sys, subprocess within the payload, and runs system commands or network operations. The obfuscation and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious intent. The payload's complexity and hiding mechanisms are typical of supply chain attacks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing obfuscated payloads during installation that can perform system-level malicious activities. The evidence supports a high malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and high security risk.",
