  "purpose": "Setuptools-based setup script for the 'pytoileur' package, configuring installation details and custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata (name, version, description, etc.), reading README.md for long description, reading input for package setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of base64-decoded code via exec(), potential file system or network interactions within the decoded code, and package setup functions.",
  "flows": "The setup script runs normally, but during execution, it executes obfuscated code decoded from base64, which then may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code executed via exec() containing base64-encoded payload, which upon decoding runs suspicious code. Hardcoded version, author info, and the obfuscated code itself are suspicious. The obfuscated code appears to import 'os', 'subprocess', and other modules, and executes system commands or network activity, which is typical for malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, such as defining package metadata and configuration. However, it contains a try-except block where it executes base64-decoded code via exec(). The decoded code is heavily obfuscated, likely intentionally, and includes system module imports and potentially malicious behaviors (e.g., executing system commands, potentially stealing data or connecting to malicious servers). This obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The script's design to hide payloads within the setup process suggests malicious purpose, especially since such code can run during package installation or import. The overall structure appears legitimate at first glance but is compromised by the embedded malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code disguises malicious behavior behind obfuscated base64-encoded payload executed during setup, indicating an attempt to embed a backdoor or perform malicious actions during package installation. This constitutes a high security concern. The rest of the script is standard, but the embedded payload significantly raises the risk level.",
