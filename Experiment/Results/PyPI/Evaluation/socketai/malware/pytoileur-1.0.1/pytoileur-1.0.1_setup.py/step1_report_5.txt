  "sinks": [
    "exec() function executing decoded code, which may execute arbitrary code.",
    "Potential network activity or file manipulation if malicious code is executed.",

  "flows": [
    "Reading long description from 'README.md' -> stored in 'long_description'.",
    "During install, 'run()' method executes, attempts to decode and run base64 string.",
    "Decoded code runs potentially malicious commands or imports potentially malicious modules.",
    "If the decoded code executes system commands or network connections, untrusted data flows could occur."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of 'exec()' with dynamically decoded base64 string, which is highly suspicious.",
    "The base64 string decodes to code that appears to import 'os', 'sys', 'subprocess', and perform actions like 'Set WshShell' and 'Run', indicating possible malicious intent.",
    "Code uses obfuscated and dynamic execution methods, likely to hide malicious payloads.",
    "The base64 string may include commands that execute system or network operations without clear purpose.",
    "No legitimate reason for such obfuscation or dynamic execution in a setup script."
  ],
  "analysis": "The setup script appears normal at first glance, but the presence of a base64-encoded string decoded and executed within the custom install command is highly suspicious. This string, when decoded, runs code that imports system modules and likely executes system commands, indicating malicious intent such as backdoor installation, system control, or data exfiltration. The use of 'exec' with a decoded string is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads. The rest of the code is standard package setup boilerplate, but the embedded payload overrides normal behavior. This pattern strongly suggests intentional malicious behavior hidden behind obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to obfuscated, dynamically executed code that could perform unauthorized system actions or exfiltrate data. The setup script is designed to hide malicious payloads within the install process, posing a significant security risk.",
