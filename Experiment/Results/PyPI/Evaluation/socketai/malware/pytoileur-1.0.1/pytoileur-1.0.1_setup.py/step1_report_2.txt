{
  "purpose": "The script is primarily for setting up a Python package named 'pytoileur' with metadata and dependencies, using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the file system (reading README.md for long description), and decodes and executes embedded base64 code during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The embedded base64 code, once decoded, is executed directly with exec(), which can potentially run malicious code, data exfiltration, or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> Decodes base64 string -> Executes code via exec() during install -> Executes embedded code that may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a base64-decoded string is highly unusual and suspicious, especially in an installation script. The code within the base64 string appears complex and obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other obvious malicious behavior is evident outside this embedded code execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script performs standard package configuration but includes a clandestine operation: it imports base64, decodes a lengthy string, and executes it during the installation process. The embedded code is highly obfuscated, likely aiming to hide malicious behavior. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is hidden within package installation routines. The rest of the script appears benign, focusing on package metadata. Given the execution of external code during install, this is highly suspicious and could compromise the user's environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor embedded as base64-encoded script executed during package installation. This behavior poses a significant security risk, as it can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user installing the package. The rest of the code is standard setup logic, but the embedded code is the primary concern.",
