  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pytoileur' with an embedded obfuscated code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading README.md file, embedded base64-encoded code executed in the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded base64 code which contains further code execution commands.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code decodes and executes obfuscated code, which then executes system commands and potentially malicious scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated base64-encoded code executed during install, use of exec() with decoded code, and the code appears to perform further code execution tasks. Hardcoded package info is benign, but the embedded code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package and overrides the install command to include executing obfuscated code via exec() after decoding a base64 string. The base64 code, when decoded, imports modules like os and subprocess, and appears to run a series of system commands. The code is intentionally obfuscated, likely to hide malicious intent. The usage of exec() with decoded code is a common technique in malicious package scripts to execute hidden payloads during installation. The embedded code seems to perform system-level operations, possibly malicious, including running shell commands and creating objects, which could be used for various harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, malicious-looking code executed during installation, which could lead to malicious activities on the host system. The code is intentionally hidden and suspicious, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent.",
