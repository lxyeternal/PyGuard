{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes a decrypted Fernet-encrypted payload during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the os module, and from the encrypted Fernet key and ciphertext within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "The code imports os; during installation on Windows, it decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it via exec(), leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads with Fernet, dynamic execution via exec(), and the execution of potentially malicious code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install class that, on Windows, decrypts an encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it with exec(). The payload is encrypted with a hardcoded key, indicating obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The presence of encrypted payloads and runtime code execution during package installation pose significant security risks, potentially allowing malicious code to run silently during installation. The overall structure suggests malicious intent or sabotage, especially since the payload is encrypted and only decrypted at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() indicates high malicious intent, posing a severe security threat. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
