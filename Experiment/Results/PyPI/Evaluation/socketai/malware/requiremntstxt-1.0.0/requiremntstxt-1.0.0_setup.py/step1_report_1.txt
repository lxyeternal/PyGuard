{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, primarily to install the package and run a custom installation step that includes decryption and execution of potentially sensitive code.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing modules (os, requests, fernet), environment variables (os.name), and executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() of decrypted code, which can execute arbitrary Python code received at runtime.",
  "flows": "The script conditionally decrypts and executes code during installation if on Windows (nt). The decrypted code is run via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hard-coded Fernet symmetric key and encrypted payload that executes during installation. The code performs decryption and then executes the result directly, which is highly suspicious. Also, the obfuscated variable and class names are unusual and typical of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata with obfuscated and meaningless descriptions. The core concern is within the custom install class 'lxFTKRPgHVYfsgpIKlhWWzIVrMzbFncLmDcevyefMYfhXjjYUsNBgdqsresZmegCIVZquLqMbXlaxwDRpqBbUxrVRyLgxqDlkGvNPDgHERgUezfneJtCzJDMAkscVYcopvZnGr'. During execution, if the OS is Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with a hard-coded key and executes it with exec(). This payload could be malicious, as it is fetched or embedded in encrypted form and executed without verification. The use of 'exec' with decrypted code is a common tactic for malicious activity. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious code that executes during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious decryption and execution mechanism that runs during package installation on Windows. The use of hard-coded keys and exec() indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or backdoor functionality. It appears designed to run arbitrary code during installation, representing a serious security risk.",
