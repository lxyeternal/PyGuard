      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth flags, silent error suppression, and suspicious comments. These factors strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a high malware score and security risk assessment. The package should be considered malicious or at least highly risky, and further investigation is recommended."
