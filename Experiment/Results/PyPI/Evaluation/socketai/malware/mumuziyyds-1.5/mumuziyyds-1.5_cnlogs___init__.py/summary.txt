  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores. Report 5 shows obfuscation and dynamic eval, raising suspicion. Adjusting the malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and the security risk from 0.6 to 0.7 better reflects the observed indicators. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants caution due to obfuscation techniques that are often used in malicious scripts."
