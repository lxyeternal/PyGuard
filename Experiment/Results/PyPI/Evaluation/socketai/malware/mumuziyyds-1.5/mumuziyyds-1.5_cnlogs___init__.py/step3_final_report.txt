  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network data, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or environment variables flow into data handling or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, complex control flow, indirect data handling, potential code hiding techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code in report 5 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. No explicit malicious actions are confirmed, but the presence of obfuscation and eval suggests potential covert behavior. Other reports are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The scores in reports 1-4 are consistent with benign code. For report 5, the suspicion is moderate; the obfuscation score of 0.8 is justified, and the malware suspicion of 0.4 is reasonable but could be slightly increased to 0.5 to reflect higher concern due to obfuscation and dynamic eval. The security risk score of 0.6 aligns with the potential threat level, but a slight increase to 0.7 could be justified if further evidence emerges.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with appropriate low scores. Report 5 shows obfuscation and dynamic eval, raising suspicion. Adjusting the malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and the security risk from 0.6 to 0.7 better reflects the observed indicators. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants caution due to obfuscation techniques that are often used in malicious scripts.",
