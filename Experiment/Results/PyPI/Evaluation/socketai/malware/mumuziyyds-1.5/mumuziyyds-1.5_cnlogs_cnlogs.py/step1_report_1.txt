{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or setup based on standard Python conventions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables and potentially external modules that may fetch data or configuration at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code which could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or imported modules through processing functions, potentially reaching sensitive operations like network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious obfuscated code are detected. No suspicious domain names or reverse shell indicators are present. The code structure appears standard, but detailed examination of imported modules and runtime behaviors is limited.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical Python script with standard module imports and function definitions. No malicious payloads or malicious logic are immediately evident. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated segments, or suspicious control flow. However, without executing or seeing external modules, it’s difficult to fully assess runtime behaviors. The code does not display typical malware indicators such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. The overall structure and content suggest a benign purpose, but caution is advised if external inputs or modules perform untrusted actions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on static review, the code does not exhibit clear signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be a standard script with no suspicious behaviors detected at this level. However, incomplete information about external dependencies and runtime environment prevents absolute certainty. The risk level is low, but continued monitoring or dynamic analysis is recommended if executed in untrusted environments.",
