  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a standard Python module or script potentially intended for general use.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, function inputs, and possibly external modules or libraries imported at the top.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or outputs data via print statements, writes to files, or network calls if present, but none are explicitly evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through functions and methods; untrusted inputs could reach output or external calls if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, importing standard libraries, defining functions or classes, and performing expected operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious system modifications. The absence of explicit network calls, file operations, or obfuscated sections suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. However, without seeing the full code context or external interactions, some uncertainties remain.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code seems benign with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. Confidence is high that this is a safe, standard script or module.",
