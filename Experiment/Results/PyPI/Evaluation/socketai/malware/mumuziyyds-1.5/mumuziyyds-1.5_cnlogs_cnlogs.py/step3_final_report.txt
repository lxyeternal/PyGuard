  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, external dependencies, runtime behaviors, control flow structures, environment variables, network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable usage, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like network transmission or file modification, possibly via control flow paths involving obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation signs, complex control flows, signs of dynamic code execution, inconsistent or suspicious patterns, but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no malicious indicators, consistent with static analysis. Obfuscation suspicion is minimal, primarily in report 4, which notes complex control flows and potential obfuscation signs. External dependencies are unknown, limiting certainty. The scores across reports are generally aligned with their summaries, with low malware (0 or 0.2), moderate obfuscation (up to 0.4), and low security risk (0.2–0.3). Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting static analysis limitations. No concrete malicious activity is detected, but obfuscation signs warrant cautious scoring. Dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign with minimal obfuscation concerns. The scores are justified based on the evidence, with a slight suspicion in report 4. No significant adjustments are necessary; ongoing monitoring and runtime testing are advised for comprehensive assurance.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
