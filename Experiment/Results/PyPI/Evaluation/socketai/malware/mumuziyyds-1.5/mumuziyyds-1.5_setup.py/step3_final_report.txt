{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and contents of /flag, encodes this data, and exfiltrates it to a remote server immediately upon module import, indicating malicious data theft activity.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), platform.node(), platform.platform(), socket connection for IP, os.popen('cat /flag')",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to http://124.70.159.15:60006/?token=... with encoded data",
  "flows": "Data gathered from system info and /flag → base64 encoding with prefix → HTTP request to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Reads /flag, silent exception handling, immediate exfiltration at import, hardcoded IP, minimal obfuscation with base64 prefixes",
  "analysis": "The code performs active collection of sensitive system data and /flag contents, encodes and exfiltrates it immediately upon import, with silent error handling and simple obfuscation. This behavior indicates covert malicious activity aimed at data theft. The exfiltration to a fixed IP and the silent failure handling further suggest malicious intent. The code lacks any benign purpose and functions as a data exfiltration backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration of sensitive system information and /flag contents immediately upon module load. The activity is clearly malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
