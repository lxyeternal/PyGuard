{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports os, requests, and fernet modules; reads environment (os.name); uses hardcoded decryption keys and encrypted payloads.",
  "sinks": "exec() function decrypts and runs code, which can execute arbitrary code; potential network activity via requests (though not explicitly used here).",
  "flows": "On Windows, os.name triggers import of requests and fernet, decrypts data with hardcoded key, then executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and execution via exec() during installation; hardcoded decryption key; code executed is not visible, suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package setup parameters and includes a custom install command class that, on Windows, imports modules, then decrypts and executes encrypted code using hardcoded cryptographic keys. The use of exec() on decrypted content is highly suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code. The encrypted payload and keys are obfuscated, indicating potential malicious intent. The package appears to perform malicious code execution during installation, which is a supply chain security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden backdoor that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious behavior. The use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded keys, and dynamic execution points to malicious intent, posing a high security risk.",
