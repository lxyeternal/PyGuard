      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, exhibiting typical malware obfuscation techniques such as dynamic import, eval/exec, and encoded payloads. While the current payload is benign, the structure allows for malicious code execution. The high obfuscation and dynamic behavior justify classifying this as malicious or at least very high risk. It should be treated as malicious, and further dynamic analysis or deobfuscation is recommended before any execution."
