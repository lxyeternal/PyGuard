  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and the 'install_requires' list specifying dependencies",
  "sinks": "Dependencies specified; no direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks indicating malicious intent; dependencies are standard",
  "anomalies": "Author fields are empty, which may indicate incomplete or intentionally obfuscated metadata; dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests' - some could be used for malicious automation or data exfiltration if misused, but are common in benign projects",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It defines a package with a name, version, author info, and required dependencies. The dependencies are popular Python packages, some of which could be exploited if misused, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious behavior. The empty author fields are unusual but not malicious per se. No code execution, input handling, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The inclusion of certain dependencies warrants cautious usage, but their presence alone does not imply malicious intent.",
