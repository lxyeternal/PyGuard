{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines a Python package with an obfuscated name and dependencies, but contains no embedded malicious code or behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; dependencies are specified but not used within this script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks are present; the script only sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'xolomayflwnfmy' and missing author information; no code obfuscation techniques or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration with no embedded malicious logic. The only suspicious aspects are the nonsensical package name and missing author info, which could be attempts at concealment but do not constitute malicious activity. Dependencies are common and not inherently malicious but could be misused if the main package code were malicious. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is around 0.2 due to the package name, and security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary concerns are the obfuscated package name and missing author info, which are not sufficient to classify the package as malicious. Overall, the package is considered low risk.",
