  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package including its name, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "The install_requires list, which specifies external dependencies that are installed with the package.",
  "flows": "The setup() call uses the install_requires list to determine which packages to install.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook', which could be used for user tracking or data collection, but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies. No malicious code or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies could potentially be used for tracking or network communication, but this is typical in many packages. The absence of author info is noteworthy but not suspicious on its own. Overall, the script appears benign and standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration with no clear indicators of malicious intent. The dependencies could be used for malicious purposes depending on their usage within the package, but the script itself does not contain malicious code.",
