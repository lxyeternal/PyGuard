  "conclusion": "All reports appropriately acknowledge the absence of code and assign low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Risk scores are conservatively low, and confidence levels are generally reasonable but could be slightly lowered where no code is provided. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the overall security posture appears benign based on available information."
