  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or code-related signals within the dependency.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, malicious network connections, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or critical operations), indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code snippets in all reports, the analysis relies on the descriptions provided. All reports correctly identify the lack of code and refrain from unwarranted suspicion. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero across the board. Risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), reflecting the limited information. Confidence scores are sometimes high despite no code being present; these should be adjusted downward to better represent the uncertainty. Overall, the assessments are cautious and consistent with the evidence, or lack thereof.",
  "conclusion": "All reports appropriately acknowledge the absence of code and assign low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Risk scores are conservatively low, and confidence levels are generally reasonable but could be slightly lowered where no code is provided. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the overall security posture appears benign based on available information.",
