{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign utility script performing file and network operations without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads from command-line arguments, files, environment variables, and imported modules that access system resources.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file I/O, environment variable access, and command-line argument processing that could potentially leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as command-line args, environment variables, and files flow into processing functions, which may send data over the network or write to files, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets described are typical utility scripts with no signs of malicious activity. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The data flows involve standard input/output and network operations without evidence of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting limited but sufficient information. Overall, the code is benign, and the low security risk score is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no malicious or obfuscated traits. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
