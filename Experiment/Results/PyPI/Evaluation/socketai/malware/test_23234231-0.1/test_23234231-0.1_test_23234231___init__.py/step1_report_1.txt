  "sources": "Reads input data from variables or external data sources such as files, environment variables, or network requests, if any are present (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout, files, network connections, or other external systems. Specific sink points are not detailed in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but no explicit source-to-sink paths are visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code structure appears typical; no obfuscated language features or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code does not contain any obvious security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, well-structured Python script with no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. Without further context or additional code, no anomalies are identified.",
