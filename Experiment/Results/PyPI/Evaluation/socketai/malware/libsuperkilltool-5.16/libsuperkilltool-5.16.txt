      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, which is a common tactic in malware. The silent error handling and presence of a suspicious URL comment increase the likelihood of malicious activity. The scores assigned are justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further analysis of the payload."
