{
  "purpose": "Provides wrappers around Windows API functions for console manipulation, such as getting buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, filling output, and setting the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads system handles via _GetStdHandle; accesses console buffer info; accepts parameters for console control functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions accept parameters but do not process external untrusted input internally.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve handle -> perform API call -> modify console state; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minor logical restriction in SetConsoleCursorPosition preventing setting position (0,0); no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of Windows console API wrappers, conditionally importing ctypes and defining functions for console info, text attributes, cursor positioning, output filling, and title setting. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is well-structured, with proper argument types and API usage. Minor logical checks may restrict setting cursor to (0,0), but this is not malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Windows console utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low risk score is justified, and the code's purpose is purely system API interaction for console control.",
