{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for interacting with the Windows console, including retrieving console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, filling output, and setting console title.",
  "sources": "Reads standard output handle, standard error handle, and console buffer info via Windows API functions such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions that modify console display properties and title. No data is sent over networks or written to files. No external input is processed directly.",
  "flows": "Retrieves console info from handles -> modifies console display attributes or position -> optionally sets console title. No untrusted data flow or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Windows API calls directly, which is unusual in simple scripts, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious loops or code injections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports and defines functions to interact with Windows console, such as retrieving buffer info, changing text attributes, cursor position, and console title. These are standard Windows API interactions. The code checks for platform compatibility and handles the absence of Windows API gracefully by defining no-op lambdas. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious modifications. All functions appear to be utility functions for console manipulation. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate module for console management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Windows console utility library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It interacts with the Windows API to perform standard console operations. No malware, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities are evident in this code segment.",
