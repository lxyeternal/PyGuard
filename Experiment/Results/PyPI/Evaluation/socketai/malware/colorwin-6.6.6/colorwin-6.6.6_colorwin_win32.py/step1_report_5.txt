{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functionalities such as changing text attributes, cursor position, and console title using ctypes to interface with the Windows API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard handles (STDOUT and STDERR) via _GetStdHandle and obtains console screen buffer info through GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the console (via functions like _SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitleW).",
  "flows": "Input streams (stdout/stderr handles) are used to get console info and set console properties; functions modify console output and appearance based on data received.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on standard Windows API calls; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Windows console control functions using ctypes. It conditionally imports Windows DLLs and defines functions to get and set console properties. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data theft, remote control, or stealth activities. The code appears to be utility functions for console UI management, which is common in CLI applications. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate utility for Windows console management without any malicious features or malicious behavior. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks.",
