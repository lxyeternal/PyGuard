  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'colorwin' Python package, intended to package and distribute a terminal text coloring library.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' and long description from 'README.rst'; user input sources are not present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is being processed or written to external systems; setup configuration uses static data.",
  "flows": "Reads package version from '__init__.py' and description from 'README.rst' to feed into setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of 'try-except' for optional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration, loading package metadata from files and configuring the package setup() call. It performs no network, file modification, or data processing beyond reading static files. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
