  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the original reports are accurate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, the risk score could be considered 0 for simplicity, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate."
