  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' module for import",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ attribute, importing sys and os.path modules",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification could influence module import resolution",
  "flows": "The code reads __file__, constructs a path, and inserts it into sys.path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard path manipulation and import setup",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to ensure that the local source of 'colorama' is imported over any installed version. It reads the script's directory, constructs a path to its parent directory, and prepends this to sys.path. This is a common practice in development or testing environments. No input data from external sources is processed, and there are no sensitive or untrusted data flows. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or access control bypasses.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard setup for local module import prioritization during development. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
