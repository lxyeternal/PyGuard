{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console manipulation functions such as setting text attributes, cursor position, and screen clearing via win32 API calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (e.g., title, position, style), system calls to win32 API functions",
  "sinks": "win32 API functions that modify console state and output, potentially affecting console display or title",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API calls like SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle; no untrusted data processing detected",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard API usage",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows console APIs, managing attributes, cursor, and screen content. It accepts parameters for customization but does not process untrusted external data internally. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs expected console control functions with proper API calls, and the design appears standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily potential misuse if external input is passed unchecked, but this does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk due to potential misuse.",
