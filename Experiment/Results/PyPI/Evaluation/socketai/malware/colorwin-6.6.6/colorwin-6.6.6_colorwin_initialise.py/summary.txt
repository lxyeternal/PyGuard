  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing console output streams with ANSI support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects reliance on external libraries but no inherent threat."
