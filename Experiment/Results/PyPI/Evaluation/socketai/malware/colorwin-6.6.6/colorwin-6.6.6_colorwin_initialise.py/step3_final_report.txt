  "purpose": "Manage ANSI to Win32 console output streams, providing initialization, cleanup, and context management for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout and sys.stderr, replacing them with wrapped streams via wrap_stream function.",
  "sinks": "Replaced sys.stdout and sys.stderr with wrapped streams; no untrusted data flows evident.",
  "flows": "Source: original sys.stdout/sys.stderr; Sink: wrapped streams used for output; flow occurs during init, reinit, and deinit functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. External class AnsiToWin32 is used but appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a utility for handling ANSI sequences on Windows consoles by wrapping standard output streams. It uses straightforward functions for initialization, cleanup, and context management, with proper registration of cleanup routines via atexit. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. External dependency 'AnsiToWin32' is standard for this purpose and does not indicate malicious intent within this context. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs a benign function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing console output streams with ANSI support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects reliance on external libraries but no inherent threat.",
