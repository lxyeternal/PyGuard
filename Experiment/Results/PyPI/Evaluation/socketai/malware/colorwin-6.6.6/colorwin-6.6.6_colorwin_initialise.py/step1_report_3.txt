{
  "purpose": "This code initializes, wraps, and manages ANSI to Windows console conversion for stdout and stderr streams, providing context management for colored output handling.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and potentially input arguments for initialization and stream wrapping functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially replaces sys.stdout and sys.stderr with wrapped streams that handle ANSI conversion; no direct sink for untrusted data is apparent.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions modify sys.stdout/sys.stderr, possibly wrapping streams; context manager ensures temporary setup and teardown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of global variables is standard for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard stream handling for ANSI escape sequence conversion, with functions to initialize, reset, deinitialize, and wrap streams. No data leakage, injection, or malicious network activity is present. It carefully manages stream redirection with cleanup via atexit. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling console color output and stream management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
