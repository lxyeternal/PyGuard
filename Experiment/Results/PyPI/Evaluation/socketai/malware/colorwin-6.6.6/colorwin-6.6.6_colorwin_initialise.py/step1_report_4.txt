{
  "purpose": "The code initializes, wraps, and manages standard output and error streams with ANSI to Win32 conversion, providing support for colored output in Windows terminals.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout and sys.stderr during initialization and wrapping functions.",
  "sinks": "Reassigns sys.stdout and sys.stderr to wrapped streams; no external data sinks or network connections present.",
  "flows": "Input is captured from sys.stdout and sys.stderr; flows through wrap_stream and AnsiToWin32 for potential modification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution are observed. Use of atexit for cleanup is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages stream wrapping for colored output. It uses standard libraries and a third-party module 'ansitowin32' to handle ANSI sequences. The code registers cleanup functions with atexit, handles context management for temporary modifications, and provides functions to reinitialize or reset stream states. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code operates within expected parameters for terminal stream management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling colored terminal output in Windows, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious payloads.",
