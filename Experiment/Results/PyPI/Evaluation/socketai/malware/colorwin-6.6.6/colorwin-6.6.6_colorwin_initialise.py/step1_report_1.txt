{
  "purpose": "This code initializes, wraps, and manages the standard output and error streams, particularly for ANSI to Windows console conversion and color management.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.stdout and sys.stderr during init, and input arguments to functions like init and wrap_stream.",
  "sinks": "Replacing sys.stdout and sys.stderr with wrapped streams, potentially influencing output behavior.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> wrap_stream -> sys.stdout/sys.stderr replacement -> output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret data. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. The use of external class AnsiToWin32 may have internal behavior, but within this code, its use appears standard. No suspicious code flows or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages the ANSI to Win32 stream wrapping process, ensuring proper initialization and cleanup of stdout/stderr. It registers cleanup functions with atexit, but does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. External dependencies are used, but they are typical for console stream management and do not indicate malicious intent. The logic is straightforward and focuses on safe stream handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for handling console output styling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages stream wrapping and cleanup without any suspicious or malicious logic involved.",
