  "purpose": "A CLI demonstration tool that styles terminal output using colorama based on user-specified command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text; colorama module dictionaries for style codes.",
  "sinks": "Concatenation of style codes with user input text; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "User input (via argparse) -> find() function retrieves style codes -> concatenation with text -> output to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with controlled choices; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign demonstration of colorama styling, accepting controlled inputs and applying styles without any malicious or suspicious behavior. Dynamic attribute access via __dict__ is safe here due to choice restrictions. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward CLI styling utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
