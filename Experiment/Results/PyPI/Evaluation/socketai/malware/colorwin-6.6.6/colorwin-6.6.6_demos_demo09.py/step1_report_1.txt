  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code demonstrates usage of the colorama library for styling terminal output based on command-line arguments.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input data comes from command-line arguments (-c, -b, -s, -t).\",\n  \"sinks\": The final print statement outputs styled text to the terminal, using arguments provided by the user.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Command-line inputs are parsed, used to look up style and color codes via 'find', then concatenated with the text and printed.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of command-line arguments for styling is typical. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Function 'find' accesses module dictionary with uppercased keys, which is standard usage.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script accepts user input via command-line options for text styling (color, background, style). It then retrieves corresponding style codes from the colorama library's attributes by dynamically accessing module __dict__ entries, after converting them to lowercase and uppercase as needed. The input parameters are directly mapped to style codes without sanitization or validation beyond choice constraints. The final output concatenates style codes with the user-provided text and resets style after printing. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or any suspicious behavior. It also does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malware-related logic. All operations are safe and typical for terminal styling demos.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code is a benign demonstration of using the colorama library with command-line arguments to style terminal output. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are present.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
