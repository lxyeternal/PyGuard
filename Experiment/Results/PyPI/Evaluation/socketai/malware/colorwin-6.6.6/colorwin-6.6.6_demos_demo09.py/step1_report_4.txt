{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate the use of the colorama library for colored command-line output based on user input arguments.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command line arguments: --colour, --background, --style, and --text.",
  "sinks": "The final print statement outputs formatted text to the console using colorama escape sequences.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed; arguments determine the style, foreground, and background colors; the formatted string is printed to the terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of dynamic attribute access with user input is controlled by choices, reducing risk of code injection. No network operations, file operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama for terminal coloring and argparse for argument parsing. It defines functions to list available style attributes and to find specific attribute values. Arguments are validated against choices derived from the module's attributes, ensuring controlled input. The final output concatenates color codes and text, resetting styles afterward. No untrusted data flows to insecure sinks, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code's functionality is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of colorama's capabilities for colored output. It employs safe practices such as validated user input and controlled attribute access, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
