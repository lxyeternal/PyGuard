{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the use of the colorama library to format terminal output with colors, styles, and backgrounds based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (--colour, --background, --style, --text).",
  "sinks": "The final print statement outputs styled text to the terminal, utilizing arguments provided by the user.",
  "flows": "Input is taken via command-line arguments and used directly to select color, background, and style; then concatenated with the text and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard library functions and well-known third-party library (colorama).",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line options for color, background, and style, defaulting to 'RESET' values if unspecified. It uses helper functions to list available styles and to find corresponding style codes from colorama. The user-provided style, color, and background are directly mapped to colorama's dictionary entries and concatenated into a styled string, which is printed. No external data sources, network connections, or insecure practices are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal styling using colorama. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
