{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Code reads from class attributes and a base64-encoded string for dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic execution functions such as exec and compile with decoded base64 content, which could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded string is decoded and compiled, then executed via exec, which may run malicious code embedded in the encoded payload.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (exec and compile) combined with base64-encoded payload is suspicious. The code embeds an encoded payload that, when decoded, appears to import modules and execute code dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for ANSI escape sequences for text color, background, styles, and cursor movement, which are typical for terminal formatting. The critical anomaly is the use of a base64-encoded string that, once decoded, is compiled and executed dynamically. This string appears to import modules, including 'templet', 'NamedTemporaryFile', and others, then executes code. This pattern is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads or execute hidden code. The rest of the code appears benign and consistent with terminal formatting utilities. The dynamic execution of the decoded payload is the primary concern and the main indicator of potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "While the core functionality of generating ANSI escape sequences is harmless, the presence of dynamically decoded and executed base64 payload is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. This pattern is often used to hide malicious code. The overall security risk is elevated due to this obfuscated code, warranting caution before trusting this package.",
