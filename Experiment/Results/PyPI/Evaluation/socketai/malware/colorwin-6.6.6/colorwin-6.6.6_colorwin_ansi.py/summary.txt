  "conclusion": "The static ANSI formatting code appears benign, but the embedded base64-encoded payload executed during class initialization is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The dynamic code execution pattern is a red flag for supply chain security, indicating possible malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified; however, the risk should be considered high until the payload is verified safe."
