      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the original reports are accurate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, the risk score could be considered 0 for simplicity, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate."

The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects reliance on external libraries but no inherent threat."

      "conclusion": "The static ANSI formatting code appears benign, but the embedded base64-encoded payload executed during class initialization is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The dynamic code execution pattern is a red flag for supply chain security, indicating possible malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified; however, the risk should be considered high until the payload is verified safe."

It poses minimal security risk, primarily potential misuse if external input is passed unchecked, but this does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting very low risk due to potential misuse."
