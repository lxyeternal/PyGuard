  "purpose": "To demonstrate the use of the colorama library for colored terminal output and verify ANSI code handling with redirected stderr.",
  "sources": "Import of sys for printing to stdout and stderr, and import of colorama for terminal color manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Printing colored text to stdout and stderr streams.",
  "flows": "Colorama's Fore constants modify the output streams; print statements send colored output to stdout and stderr, respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama, then prints colored text to stdout and stderr streams. It uses standard libraries and a third-party library to manage terminal colors. There are no data leaks, network activities, or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be a simple demonstration or test of ANSI color handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for demonstrating colored output in the terminal. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
