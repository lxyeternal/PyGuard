  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of colorama for colored terminal output and verifies that stderr redirection does not affect stdout.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys.stdin, sys.stderr, and colorama initialization.",
  "sinks": "Print statements to stdout and stderr with colored output.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama -> print colored message to stdout -> print colored message to stderr -> subsequent stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'fixpath', but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, then prints colored messages to stdout and stderr to test ANSI escape sequence handling and redirection. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The 'fixpath' import is unused but harmless. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are detected. The code is straightforward and serves a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of ANSI color handling with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
