{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing, potentially involving external input or data sources.",
  "sources": "Input data might come from external files, user input, or environment variables (not explicitly shown but typical in such scripts).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, or executing dynamic code (none explicitly identified).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching output functions or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads data (possibly from files or user input), processes it using standard functions, and outputs results. No evidence of malicious payloads, such as network exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors, is present. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical for data processing. No suspicious behaviors like code injection, credential theft, or privacy violations are detected. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code segments.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script with no indications of malicious intent.",
