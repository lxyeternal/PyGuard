      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, exfiltrating sensitive wallet files and system info via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials and operates without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9-1, securityRisk: 0.9-1) are justified. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall threat level is high. I recommend classifying this as malware with maximum severity."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a setup for ASCII art rendering with no malicious intent. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports and the unknown behavior of initialize(), which warrants further inspection but does not currently justify higher malware or security risk scores."
