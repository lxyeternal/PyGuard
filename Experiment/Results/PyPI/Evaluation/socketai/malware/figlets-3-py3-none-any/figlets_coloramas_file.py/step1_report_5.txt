{
  "purpose": "The script collects sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files, zips these files, and exfiltrates them via Telegram messages, potentially for malicious data theft or espionage.",
  "sources": "User input data includes username (via getpass), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), and files from specific directories. Network requests fetch IP info and send data to Telegram.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Telegram API for sending messages and files; file system operations including creating, writing, and deleting zip files; reading sensitive files from user directories.",
  "flows": "User and environment data are collected, sensitive wallet files are added to a zip archive, which is then read and transmitted over the network via Telegram API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, direct access to user wallet files and passwords without validation, exfiltration of potentially sensitive files, use of try-except blocks with broad exception handling, no user consent, and potential malware behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system username and environment variables, then constructs paths to exodus wallet files. If these files exist, it creates a zip archive and adds various wallet-related files and passwords without user consent, indicating data theft. It then fetches the public IP address and country code, creates a flag emoji, and composes a message with collected info. The script sends this message and the zip file over Telegram, then deletes the archive. Hardcoded credentials and direct access to sensitive files point to malicious intent, primarily aimed at covertly exfiltrating private wallet data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for malicious data exfiltration by collecting sensitive wallet files and personal information, then sending it to an external Telegram account. It exhibits clear signs of malicious intent with hardcoded credentials, unauthorized file access, and network communication to suspicious endpoints.",
