{
  "purpose": "The script collects potentially sensitive user data from Exodus wallet directories and files, compresses them, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram, indicating malicious intent aimed at stealing wallet information.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), wallet-related files and directories, and external IP address via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data as a file to a Telegram chat via bot API; performs file writes and deletions; makes network requests to external IP geolocation service and Telegram API.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and wallet files -> Data packaging into zip -> Data transmitted to Telegram API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of wallet and sensitive files without user consent, exfiltration of data via Telegram, use of try-except blocks to suppress errors, and dynamic IP and country info collection for potentially malicious tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by collecting environment variables and user-specific wallet files from the Exodus directory. If such files exist, it creates a ZIP archive including sensitive files and some password files. It then retrieves the external IP address and country code for geolocation, replacing a placeholder in the message with country flag emojis. Subsequently, it sends a detailed message and the ZIP file to a hardcoded Telegram bot, indicating data exfiltration. The code demonstrates typical data theft behavior with minimal obfuscation, using hardcoded tokens and indirect network calls, which could be used maliciously. No legitimate functionality or user interaction is evident, strongly suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data stealer targeting Exodus wallet files, exfiltrating user data to a Telegram bot. Its behavior, including hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive files, and network exfiltration, classifies it as malicious with high security risk. It exhibits straightforward malicious patterns without obfuscation, confirming intentional malicious activity.",
