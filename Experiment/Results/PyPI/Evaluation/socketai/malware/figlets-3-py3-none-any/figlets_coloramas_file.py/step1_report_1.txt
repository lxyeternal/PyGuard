{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather sensitive information related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the user's system, compress it into a zip file, and exfiltrate it via Telegram messages.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, file system paths (e.g., wallet files, config files), and external HTTP requests for IP info.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and files, file write operations, and file deletion.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is read from system files and environment variables, compressed into a zip archive, and then uploaded via Telegram API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; extensive access to user wallet files and configuration files; exfiltration of data without user consent; manipulation of system files; use of environment variables for user data; lack of any user prompt or permission checks.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by collecting user-specific wallet and configuration files from the system, then creates a zip archive containing these files. It constructs a message that includes the user's IP address and geolocation, which it retrieves via external API calls. The code then sends this message and the archive to a Telegram bot specified by hardcoded credentials. The code operates silently, without user consent, and deletes the archive after sending. The presence of hardcoded credentials, unsolicited data collection, and data exfiltration activities strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data stealer targeting Exodus wallet files and configuration data, exfiltrating sensitive user information via Telegram. It contains hardcoded credentials, accesses sensitive files, and performs covert data transmission, indicating malicious behavior.",
