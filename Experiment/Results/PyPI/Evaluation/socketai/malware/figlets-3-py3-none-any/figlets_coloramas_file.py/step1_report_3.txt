{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather and compress sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files and send them to a Telegram bot, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for paths, checking file existence, accessing specific wallet-related files, and performing HTTP GET requests to retrieve external IP and country information.",
  "sinks": "Writing wallet files into a ZIP archive, sending messages and documents via Telegram API, and deleting ZIP files after transmission.",
  "flows": "Sensitive files are collected and written into a ZIP archive, then this archive is read and sent over the network to a remote Telegram bot endpoint. External IP and country info are also fetched and included in the message.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, direct collection and transmission of potentially sensitive wallet files, use of multiple try-except blocks without specific error handling, and the automated exfiltration of user data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves user-specific directories and wallet files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and uploads both the archive and a message with IP and country info to a Telegram bot. The presence of hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive wallet data, and automated exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any validation or user interaction, and the operations are geared towards surreptitious data theft. No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward but designed for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and demonstrates malicious behavior aimed at stealing and transmitting sensitive wallet files and user information to an external party. The hardcoded credentials and automated exfiltration make it dangerous for end-users, indicating it should be considered malicious malware.",
