{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect specific user data related to the Exodus wallet application, compress it into a ZIP archive, and then send this data to a Telegram bot, likely for malicious purposes such as data theft or unauthorized monitoring.",
  "sources": "User input includes the username obtained via getpass.getuser() and environment variables for directories; data files are read from predefined paths related to the Exodus wallet; network requests to IP geolocation API and Telegram API for sending data.",
  "sinks": "Sending a ZIP file containing sensitive wallet data over Telegram; requesting IP geolocation information; posting messages and documents to Telegram chat ID.",
  "flows": "Collect user data from specific paths, package into ZIP, then upload ZIP to Telegram via POST request; also, fetch IP and country code and include in message.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of wallet-related files (potentially sensitive) without user consent; use of requests to send potentially sensitive data externally; code does not verify existence of files before attempting to write; constructing message with potential placeholders; potential misuse of environment variables and file paths.",
  "analysis": "The script first gathers user-specific directories and wallet-related files, packages them into a ZIP archive, and then sends this archive to a Telegram chat. It also fetches external IP address and country code, embedding the country flag into the message. The presence of hardcoded credentials, collection of wallet files, and automatic uploading to a remote server suggest malicious intent aimed at data exfiltration. The code does not contain any obfuscation, but it performs suspicious activities such as gathering sensitive files, collecting IP data, and transmitting data to an external service without user approval or transparency. The logic is straightforward, with no evasive techniques or malicious payloads beyond the exfiltration process.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior: it collects sensitive user wallet files, packages them, and transmits them to an external Telegram bot, likely for theft or unauthorized monitoring. Hardcoded credentials and the nature of data collection strongly indicate malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscated code, but its activities are suspicious and pose significant security risks.",
