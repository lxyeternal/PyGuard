{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive wallet and configuration files from the user's system, creates a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via Telegram, effectively stealing wallet data without user consent.",
  "sources": "Wallet files, configuration files, environment variables, external IP and geolocation APIs",
  "sinks": "Telegram API (sending message and document), file system (creating and deleting ZIP archive), network requests to IP API",
  "flows": "Reads wallet and config files -> creates ZIP archive -> retrieves IP and geolocation -> constructs message -> sends message and ZIP via Telegram API",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, silent operation without user prompts, broad exception handling, inclusion of sensitive files",
  "analysis": "The script accesses user wallet files and configuration data, packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials. It also fetches external IP and geolocation info to include in the message. The code operates covertly, with no user interaction, and deletes the archive after transmission. The straightforward structure and use of hardcoded secrets indicate malicious intent, typical of malware designed for data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, exfiltrating sensitive wallet data via Telegram with hardcoded credentials and no user consent. It exhibits clear malware behavior with high severity, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores.",
