{
  "purpose": "This script collects user data related to Exodus wallet files and sends them to a specified Telegram chat, effectively exfiltrating sensitive wallet information.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser() for username; environment variables for paths; requests.get() for IP and country code; file existence checks; reading wallet-related files; opening zip files.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to Telegram API for sending messages and files; writing files to zip archive; deleting files; potential network communication for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "User data and wallet files are collected based on user directory; sensitive files are added to zip archive; exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST to Telegram API, sending wallet info and IP details.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; direct collection of wallet-related files without user consent; combining data collection with network exfiltration; minimal error handling; use of try-except blocks that suppress errors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules, then initializes by gathering user-specific paths and sensitive wallet files. If certain files or directories exist, it zips these files and appends status messages. It retrieves the external IP and country code via HTTP requests, and prepares a message including this info with a flag emoji representing the country. The zip archive and message are then sent to a Telegram bot, with the archive being deleted afterward. The presence of hardcoded bot credentials, collection of wallet files, and network transmission of potentially sensitive data strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at wallet theft and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a wallet stealer by collecting sensitive Exodus wallet files and sending them to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. It employs obfuscation tactics such as hardcoded credentials and indirect data exfiltration, indicating malicious behavior.",
