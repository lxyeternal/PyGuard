{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive wallet files and configuration data related to Exodus, packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram API to a hardcoded chat ID, along with system IP and country info.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), specific wallet and configuration files, network requests to IP API for geolocation.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents, file system for creating and deleting ZIP archive.",
  "flows": "Reads wallet/config files and environment info → creates ZIP archive → retrieves IP and geolocation → sends message and ZIP via Telegram → deletes ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of sensitive files without user consent, transmission of sensitive data over network, minimal error handling, no encryption or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script targets specific wallet files and directories, packages them into a ZIP, and exfiltrates via Telegram API. It also retrieves external IP and country code to include in the message. The use of hardcoded credentials and direct network exfiltration without user consent indicates malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs data theft of valuable wallet information. The network requests to IP API and Telegram API are used to gather system info and send data externally. Error handling is minimal, but this does not mitigate the malicious nature. The behavior aligns with typical wallet-stealing malware, designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, exfiltrating sensitive wallet files and system info via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials and operates without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9-1, securityRisk: 0.9-1) are justified. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall threat level is high. I recommend classifying this as malware with maximum severity.",
