  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and our understanding.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script collects sensitive wallet files, system info, and exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- The code contains hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which is suspicious.\n- The script targets specific Exodus wallet files and directories.\n- It creates a ZIP archive of these files and sends it over Telegram, indicating malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n- The reports assign high malware scores (~0.9 to 1) and high security risk (~0.9 to 1), which seems appropriate given the malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code does indeed perform data exfiltration of sensitive wallet files, IP info, and configuration files.\n- It uses network requests to IP APIs and Telegram API to send data.\n- The files are collected from specific paths related to Exodus wallet.\n- The code does not obfuscate itself but is straightforward.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- No factual inaccuracies are apparent in the reports. They correctly identify the malicious intent.\n- The reports mention the use of try-except blocks that suppress errors, which could hide failures but also hide malicious failures—this is correctly noted.\n- The reports sometimes mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" based on assumptions, but in this case, behavior is clearly malicious.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- The malware scores are high (~0.9 to 1), which aligns with the confirmed malicious exfiltration.\n- The security risk scores are also high (~0.9 to 1), consistent with the malicious activity.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports seem to base their conclusions on observable behavior, not assumptions.\n- No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:** Given the data exfiltration of wallet files, the malware score should be **close to 1**. The reports' scores of 0.9 to 1 are reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** High, as the script exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is clearly malicious, acting as a wallet stealer.\n- The reports correctly identify this behavior.\n- The high malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 1.0 (definite malware behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 1.0 (high security risk due to data theft)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No significant revisions are necessary.",
