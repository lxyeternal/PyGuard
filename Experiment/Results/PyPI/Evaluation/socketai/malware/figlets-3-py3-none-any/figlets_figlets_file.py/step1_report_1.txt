{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather specific user data, particularly from the Exodus wallet application, compresses it into a zip file, and then sends the data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, specific file paths related to Exodus wallet, and network requests to retrieve IP address and country code.",
  "sinks": "Sending data through Telegram API (both message and document), reading sensitive files, and creating zip files with sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and sensitive files are collected, packaged into a zip archive, and then transmitted via Telegram bot API. IP and location data are also fetched and included in the message.",
  "anomalies": "The script collects potentially sensitive wallet data, then sends it over the network without user consent. Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are suspicious. The code writes sensitive files into a zip archive and uploads them, which indicates potential credential theft or data exfiltration. Usage of try-except blocks without handling exceptions properly could hide errors, but it might also hide malicious failures.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves user-specific wallet data and related files, packages them into a zip archive, and then exfiltrates this data to a Telegram account. It also queries the external IP and country code, embedding a country flag into the message. The presence of hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID, combined with data collection and exfiltration, strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since it targets wallet files, which are highly sensitive. No obfuscation is apparent; the code is straightforward, but the behavior is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to harvest sensitive wallet data and transmit it to an external server (Telegram). It collects user data without consent, packs it into a zip file, and exfiltrates it, which is consistent with malicious behavior aimed at data theft. The hardcoded credentials and targeted file collection confirm its malicious intent.",
