  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code and my own assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code behavior:**\n- Collects user-specific wallet and configuration files related to Exodus.\n- Packages these files into a ZIP archive.\n- Retrieves external IP and country code.\n- Sends a message and the ZIP archive via Telegram API to a hardcoded chat ID.\n- Deletes the ZIP archive afterward.\n- Uses hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID.\n- No obfuscation; straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Data exfiltration of Exodus wallet info via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, specific wallet files.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API (message + document).\n- **Flow:** Collect files → zip → send → delete.\n- **Anomalies:** Sensitive files collected without user consent, hardcoded token/chat ID, exfiltration behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Strongly indicates malicious intent, data theft.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious, data exfiltration confirmed.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **Security risk:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues here. The report correctly identifies malicious exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—collect and exfiltrate wallet data via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, wallet files, IP API.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API, file system.\n- **Flow:** Data collection → zip → send.\n- **Anomalies:** No user consent, hardcoded credentials, exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; behavior is malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious exfiltration.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **Security risk:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Collects sensitive wallet data, exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, files, IP API.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API, file system.\n- **Flow:** Gather data → zip → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded token, no user consent, exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—clear malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malicious data theft.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0.9 (slightly less, but still high)\n- **Security risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. Slightly lower malware score, but still very high.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—collect and send wallet info/IP to Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, files, IP API.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API, file deletion.\n- **Flow:** Data collection → zip → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded token, no consent, data exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion—malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Data exfiltration, malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **Security risk:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Collects and exfiltrates Exodus wallet files via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, wallet files, IP API.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API.\n- **Flow:** Gather → zip → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded token, no consent, direct exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Same malicious pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Wallet stealer, malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0.9 (again slightly less, but very high)\n- **Security risk:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree on the malicious nature of the code: exfiltration of sensitive wallet data, use of hardcoded credentials, and network transmission to an attacker-controlled Telegram account.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0.9 or 1, securityRisk: 0.9 or 1) are appropriate given the behavior.\n- The malware score of 1 in reports 1 and 2 is justified; even 0.9 in others reflects high risk.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flow descriptions are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 1 (full malicious intent confirmed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 1 (high severity due to sensitive data exfiltration)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code’s behavior is clearly malicious, targeting wallet files and transmitting them without user consent.\n- The use of hardcoded credentials and direct network exfiltration confirms malicious intent.\n- No false positives or assumptions are present; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable. I agree with the overall assessment that this is a malicious, high-risk data exfiltration script targeting Exodus wallet users.",
