{
  "purpose": "The script collects sensitive user data related to the Exodus wallet and exfiltrates it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), file existence checks, and network requests to IP geolocation API.",
  "sinks": "The code writes sensitive wallet files to a ZIP archive and sends it over Telegram as a document. It also sends a message with geolocation info and a constructed message including user data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and files lead to collection of sensitive data; this data is packaged into a ZIP file and then exfiltrated via Telegram APIs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token, construction of ZIP archive with potentially sensitive files, and sending user information and wallet files to an external server without user consent. The code also retrieves and sends IP location info and constructs a message with user details.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by gathering system info, such as username and environment paths, and sets hardcoded paths to sensitive wallet files. If any wallet-related files or directories exist, it creates a ZIP archive including these files and some specific files on the desktop, downloads, and documents. It then constructs a message containing user info, including geolocation obtained via an IP API, and replaces a placeholder with a country flag. It sends this information and the ZIP file to a Telegram chat via a bot token embedded in the code. The code exfiltrates sensitive wallet data, potentially without user awareness, indicating malicious intent. The code does not obfuscate itself but uses straightforward file operations and network requests. The hardcoded token and the nature of data collection strongly suggest malicious behavior intended for theft or spying.",
  "conclusion": "The script acts as a data stealer targeting Exodus wallet users by collecting wallet files and user info, then exfiltrating them via Telegram. It is malicious in intent, designed to steal sensitive user data, and should be considered dangerous.",
