{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user information, such as wallet files and configuration data related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet, compresses these files, and then transmits them to a remote server via Telegram API.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, file system paths for wallet and configuration files, network requests to IP and country APIs, and the Telegram API for sending messages and documents.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and files, and file system operations such as creating ZIP archives and deleting files.",
  "flows": "Sensitive files are gathered from user directories, added to a ZIP archive, then the archive and a message with IP and location info are sent to a remote Telegram chat ID.",
  "anomalies": "The script accesses and copies potentially sensitive wallet data and configuration files without user consent. It automatically compresses and exfiltrates these files via Telegram, which indicates malicious intent. The code also constructs a message with IP and country info, and replaces a placeholder with a country flag, all indicative of data exfiltration. No user input validation or authorization checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and defining an initialize() function. It retrieves user info and environment variables, constructs file paths related to Exodus wallet data, and checks if certain files exist. If so, it creates a ZIP archive containing those files. It appends status messages about the added files. It fetches the system's IP address and country code from external APIs, constructs a message including this info and a country flag, then sends this message and the ZIP archive via Telegram's API to a specified chat ID. Finally, it attempts to delete the ZIP archive. The behavior indicates an intent to surreptitiously collect and transmit sensitive wallet data and system info to an attacker-controlled Telegram account.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by stealthily exfiltrating sensitive user wallet data and system information through Telegram. It operates without user consent, accessing private files and transmitting them externally, which qualifies as a severe security risk. The overall design and actions strongly suggest malicious intent.",
