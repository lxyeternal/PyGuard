{
  "purpose": "The code collects specific user data files related to Exodus wallet, compresses them into a zip file, and sends the data and user's IP information to a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser() for username; environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP); filesystem checks for specific files; HTTP GET requests to IP-API endpoints; reading files for zipping; Telegram API calls.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to Telegram API with message and document; os.remove to delete zip file.",
  "flows": "Username and environment variables used to construct file paths -> checking existence of files -> zipping files if found -> fetching IP info from external API -> sending data and files via Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token; collection of sensitive wallet files without user consent; sending potentially sensitive user data over network; no authentication or encryption for data transmission; no clear user consent indication.",
  "analysis": "The script targets specific Exodus wallet files, which are sensitive and private. It zips and exfiltrates these files to a remote Telegram bot, indicating malicious intent or a supply chain attack. The hardcoded token and targeted file paths suggest intentional data theft. The code does not perform any validation, authentication, or obfuscation, and it actively sends user data without user awareness. This behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration, constituting clear malware behavior. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or evasive techniques, but the intent and actions are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet data and user IP info to a remote server via Telegram. It operates without user consent, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscation, but its actions are harmful.",
