  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, exfiltrating sensitive wallet files and system info via Telegram. It uses hardcoded credentials and operates without user consent. The behavior is consistent with malware, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9-1, securityRisk: 0.9-1) are justified. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall threat level is high. I recommend classifying this as malware with maximum severity."
