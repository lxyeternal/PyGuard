      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, indicative of malicious activity or payload delivery. While the package metadata appears benign, the embedded behavior warrants thorough investigation before deployment. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified given the evidence."
