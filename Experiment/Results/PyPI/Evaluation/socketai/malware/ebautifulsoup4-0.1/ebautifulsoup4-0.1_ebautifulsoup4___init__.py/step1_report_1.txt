{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports standard modules and executes basic functions, likely for data processing or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, user input, or environment variables (if any are present). Specific source points are not explicitly identified due to lack of visible input functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network connections, or system commands if such functions are used later in the code (not shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (file/network/system), if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code does not perform any unusual or malicious actions. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears standard, without signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no suspicious data flows, external network connections, or unusual code constructs. The overall structure is straightforward, focusing on basic data handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign and does not exhibit malicious patterns.",
