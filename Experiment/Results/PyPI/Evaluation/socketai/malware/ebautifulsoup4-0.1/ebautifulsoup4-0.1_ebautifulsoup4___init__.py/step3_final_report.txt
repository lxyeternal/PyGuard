  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data, code snippets, or descriptions provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, malicious network activity, or system modifications indicated by suspicious code patterns.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources through code logic to sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious network calls not justified by benign code descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with assessments consistently showing no malicious or obfuscated patterns. Malware scores are uniformly 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risks are low (around 0.2), reflecting cautious but justified uncertainty due to limited code context. Confidence levels are high where code exists, low when absent. The reasoning in each report aligns with the scores, and no inconsistencies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code is benign with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture appears safe.",
