  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files, but specific sources are not identifiable without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be determined without concrete code segments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns can be identified without code content. Lack of code prevents detection of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of actual code content, no step-by-step analysis is possible. All evaluation relies on code content, which is missing.",
  "conclusion": "No specific code provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. Without code, confidence in assessment is low.",
