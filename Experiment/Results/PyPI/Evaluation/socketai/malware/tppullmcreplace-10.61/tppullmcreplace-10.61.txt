      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The package appears legitimate in metadata but contains embedded payloads that pose significant security risks. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified; further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive assessment."
