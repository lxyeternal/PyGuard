{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download, rename, and execute remote executable files from untrusted sources, specifically from Discord CDN URLs, as part of a malicious payload delivery mechanism embedded within a package setup script.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/.../ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe'), file write operations, and subprocess execution commands.",
  "sinks": "Writing executable files to 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', renaming them, and executing via os.startfile() which can run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code fetches content from URLs, writes to disk, renames files, then executes them, followed by cleanup of temporary files and directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system-like directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' to disguise malicious files, broad exception handling suppressing errors, and immediate execution of downloaded payloads without verification.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a benign setup configuration but then proceeds to download two executable files from Discord CDN URLs. It saves these files with misleading names in a disguised system directory, then executes them immediately. The code attempts to delete the files and directory afterward, likely to evade detection. The URLs are suspicious, and the behavior aligns with malware delivery tactics. The code does not perform any validation of the downloaded files, indicating malicious intent. The straightforward nature of the code, with no obfuscation, suggests deliberate malicious activity embedded within a seemingly benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent, actively downloading and executing remote payloads without verification, with cleanup procedures to hide traces. The behavior is characteristic of malware, warranting a malware score of 1, a high security risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score of 0. The overall assessment confirms it as a high-severity supply chain malicious payload.",
