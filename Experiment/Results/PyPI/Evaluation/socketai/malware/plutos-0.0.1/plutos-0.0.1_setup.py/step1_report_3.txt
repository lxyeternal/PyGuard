{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package but also contains malicious behavior that downloads and executes external files from a Discord CDN, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": [
    "URL variables 'url' and 'url2' that point to external executable files.",
    "Requests library calls to fetch remote files.",
    "File operations such as open, write, and rename that handle downloaded files.",
    "os.startfile calls to execute downloaded files.",
    "os.mkdir and shutil.rmtree for directory manipulation."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "Executing downloaded files via os.startfile.",
    "Writing files to the system directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK'."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Requests fetch executable files from remote URLs.",
    "Downloaded files are written locally as 'ZYXMN.exe' and 'ZYRBX.exe'.",
    "Files are renamed and moved to system directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK'.",
    "The system executes these files immediately with os.startfile."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of hardcoded URLs pointing to executable files on Discord CDN.",
    "Downloading and executing external binaries, which is unusual and suspicious.",
    "Writing files into a directory with a name resembling a temporary or system directory but with a suspicious name.",
    "Using broad exception handling that suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
    "Package 'keywords' contains 'hack', which is suspicious for a benign package.",
    "Importing modules twice, indicating unoptimized or obfuscated code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script starts with a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including benign-looking metadata. However, it then proceeds to perform malicious actions: it downloads two executable files from a Discord CDN, saves them locally, renames them to appear as system files, and executes them immediately. The use of hardcoded URLs and direct execution of remote files indicates malicious intent, likely to install malware or backdoors. The directory used is suspicious, and the broad exception handling prevents detection of errors. The presence of the keyword 'hack' in setup hints at potentially malicious purpose. Overall, the code exhibits typical malicious behaviors associated with malware delivery via Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior by downloading, renaming, and executing remote executable files, likely as part of a malware delivery mechanism. The setup metadata may be misleading or used to disguise the intent, but the core actions are highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
