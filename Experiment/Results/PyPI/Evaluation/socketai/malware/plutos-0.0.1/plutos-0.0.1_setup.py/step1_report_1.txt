{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package configuration and then downloads and executes potentially malicious executables from external URLs.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/...'), file system operations (reading/writing files, creating directories), and execution of downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.startfile, writing files to system directories, and removal of files/directories.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() downloads content -> saves as files -> renames files -> executes files -> deletes files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading executables from suspicious Discord CDN URLs, saving to system directory with a disguised folder name, executing downloaded files directly, and cleaning up files/directories immediately after execution.",
  "analysis": "The code initially contains setup configurations for a Python package, which is benign. However, the core logic involves downloading two executable files from Discord CDN links, saving them in a system directory with a name that mimics Windows system folders, then executing these files. The removal of files and directory cleanup suggests an attempt to hide activity. The external URLs and the behavior of executing downloaded files indicate malicious intent, potentially malware designed for remote control or persistence. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate, user-focused functions; rather, it focuses on stealthy download and execution, typical of malware delivery mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and cleaning up executable files from untrusted sources, indicative of malware activity. The initial setup code is unrelated but not suspicious by itself. Overall, this code is highly malicious and should be considered unsafe for use.",
