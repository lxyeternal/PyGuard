  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a setup script for a Python package, but it also contains malicious behavior involving downloading and executing files from external sources.",
  "sources": [
    "The URLs from which executable files are downloaded (`https://cdn.discordapp.com/...`) in the middle of the code.",
    "The `requests.get` calls that fetch external content.",
    "The hardcoded file paths and commands that execute downloaded files."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The `open().write()` functions saving executable files.",
    "The `os.startfile()` calls executing the downloaded files.",
    "The `shutil.rmtree()` removing directories."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "From the URLs in `requests.get()` (source) to the `write()` functions (sink) writing files locally.",
    "From writing files to the `os.startfile()` functions executing these files.",
    "From directory removal (`shutil.rmtree`) to cleaning up traces."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing potentially malicious executables from Discord CDN URLs.",
    "Use of hardcoded paths (`C:\\$Windows.~SXK`) to store files.",
    "Obfuscated and misleading setup code, such as the package setup mixed with malicious payload.",
    "Repackaging malicious intent within a setup script."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins with a typical setup script, but then proceeds to download two executable files from external URLs, saves them to a suspicious directory, and executes them. The files are stored in a directory named `$Windows.~SXK`, which mimics system directories, possibly to evade detection. The script then deletes the directory, leaving minimal traces. The presence of direct `requests.get` calls, writing executable files, and immediate execution indicates malicious behavior aimed at delivering payloads or backdoors. These actions are inconsistent with standard package setup procedures and strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior involving downloading, saving, and executing external executables from untrusted sources. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, with a malware score close to 1. It is designed to surreptitiously run potentially harmful files, indicative of supply chain attack tactics.",
