{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package configuration and then downloads and executes potentially malicious executable files from remote URLs, subsequently cleaning up temporary files.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe), reading environment variables, and file operations including creation and deletion of files.",
  "sinks": "Writing to disk ('ZYXMN.exe', 'ZYRBX.exe'), renaming files, executing downloaded files via os.startfile, deleting directories.",
  "flows": "Code downloads content from remote URLs, writes content to files, renames files to system-like paths, executes these files, and then removes temporary directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Discord CDN URLs to fetch executable files, renaming files to system-like paths, immediate execution of downloaded files, cleaning up directories after execution. The code also includes package setup code that is irrelevant to the malware activity but may serve as obfuscation or distraction.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical malicious behaviors such as downloading and executing remote payloads, disguising files within system directories, and cleaning up traces. The package setup code is benign but seems to be included as a cover or to avoid suspicion. The download URLs are suspicious, pointing to Discord CDN, which is often used to host malicious payloads. The code does not check the content of the downloaded files, nor does it verify their integrity, increasing risk. The immediate execution of downloaded files indicates malicious intent to compromise the system. Overall, the code exhibits clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing unauthorized download and execution of remote executables, likely to compromise or control the system. The package setup code appears unrelated but may serve to mask the malicious activities. The overall risk is high, and this code should be considered malicious.",
