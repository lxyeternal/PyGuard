      "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent, actively downloading and executing remote payloads without verification, with cleanup procedures to hide traces. The behavior is characteristic of malware, warranting a malware score of 1, a high security risk score of 1, and an obfuscation score of 0. The overall assessment confirms it as a high-severity supply chain malicious payload."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by stealthily downloading and executing external code without validation, using disguising techniques. It should be classified as malware with high severity. The scores are consistent with this assessment, though the obfuscation level is minimal and could be rated lower. Overall, it poses a severe security threat and should be flagged accordingly."
