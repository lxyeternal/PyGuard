  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, a common tactic in malicious supply chain components. The high obfuscation and execution pattern justify elevated malware and risk scores. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this as potentially malicious."
