{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'py-pyintelcpu' with specified metadata, possibly to distribute or install this package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system to check for the existence of 'tahg' and reads environment and system data during setup; it also imports modules such as subprocess and os.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could potentially be used to run malicious code or establish hidden processes.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> If not exists, executes encoded PowerShell command -> Proceeds to setup package configuration; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded, which is suspicious; it runs without user interaction and is hidden; the setup code is standard but combined with the encoded command suggests possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing distutils.setup and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It then checks for the existence of a file/directory named 'tahg'. If not present, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts. The PowerShell command, when decoded, likely performs a network or system operation, potentially malicious. The setup function is called afterward to configure a Python package with specified metadata. The use of a base64-encoded command to run hidden PowerShell commands is a red flag for malicious activity, especially since the command is executed without any user consent or verification.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated PowerShell code executed in a hidden process, which is suspicious and could be malicious. The setup portion appears legitimate but is preceded by potentially harmful behavior. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious potential due to the encoded payload executed silently.",
