  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during installation, strongly indicating malicious activity. The high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.85), and risk (0.9) are justified based on the evidence. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious."
