{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically creates a temporary Python script that fetches and executes content from a remote URL, then attempts to run that script using the current Python interpreter.",
  "sources": "Reading from tempfile to create a script; reading the system executable path; reading environment and system commands.",
  "sinks": "Executing the downloaded remote content via exec; running a system command to execute the temporary file.",
  "flows": "The temporary file contains code that requests and executes remote code; the system command runs the temporary script, executing remote code on the local machine.",
  "anomalies": "The code fetches and executes remote code without validation, uses a hardcoded URL, writes malicious code directly into a temporary file, and attempts to run it unsafely. The remote URL appears suspicious, and the code is obfuscated in a way that hides its malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python snippet that performs a network request to a suspicious URL, then executes the retrieved content dynamically. It then attempts to run this file using a system call, which could execute arbitrary malicious code. The use of 'exec' on data fetched from a URL is highly risky, as it allows remote code execution. The URL 'https://discock.netlify.app/discock/nigger' is suspicious and potentially malicious. The code also uses system commands to run the temporary script, increasing the risk of code execution. Overall, the script is designed to run remote code without validation, representing a serious security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, as it downloads and executes remote code without validation, posing a high security risk. It appears to be designed for malicious remote code execution, making it unsafe to run.",
