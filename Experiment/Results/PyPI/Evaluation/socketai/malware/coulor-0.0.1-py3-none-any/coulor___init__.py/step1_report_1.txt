{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python package, possibly configuring environment settings or preparing for execution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, and reads configuration files or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, makes network requests, executes system commands, or stores data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or user input → imported modules/functions → system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure appears straightforward, with no unusual dynamic code execution or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks such as importing modules and reading environment variables. No indicators of malicious activities like data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network connections are evident. The lack of external network requests or file modifications raises low suspicion. The code structure is standard with no obfuscated segments. The overall behavior suggests legitimate initialization without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal setup routine with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
