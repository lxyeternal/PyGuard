      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently based on filesystem state, with embedded malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify these issues, and their scoring aligns with the evidence. The package poses a significant security threat and should be considered malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
