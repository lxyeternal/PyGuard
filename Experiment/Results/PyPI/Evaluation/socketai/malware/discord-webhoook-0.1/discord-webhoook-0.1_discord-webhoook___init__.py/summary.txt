  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates low to moderate risk with no confirmed malicious code. The scores should be slightly lowered for Report 1 to reflect the lack of concrete evidence. The assessments are aligned with the descriptions, and no significant obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The supply chain security posture appears acceptable with cautious suspicion in some cases."
