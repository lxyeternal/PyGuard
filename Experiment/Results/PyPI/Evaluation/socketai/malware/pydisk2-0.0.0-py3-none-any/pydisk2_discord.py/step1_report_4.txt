{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from web browsers, messaging applications, and other installed programs, then exfiltrating that data via Discord webhooks and file hosting services. It functions as a stealer or malware aimed at collecting and transmitting user data without consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser storage files (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord local data, browser log and leveldb files, login data databases, cookies, local state files, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into requests to Discord webhooks (for exfiltration), requests to upload files to external file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), and possibly via network requests to external APIs for geolocation, token validation, and user data retrieval.",
  "flows": "The code extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files; then it encodes or copies them into files; subsequently, it uploads these files or sends data directly to webhooks, forming source-to-sink paths that exfiltrate sensitive user data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent, including hardcoded webhook URL, functions for extracting tokens and sensitive data, bypassing security measures (e.g., decrypting stored passwords and cookies), attempting to kill processes, zipping and uploading files, and extensive data collection from user directories. The presence of functions that target specific browser and application data, coupled with automated data exfiltration, is suspicious. Additionally, obfuscation signals are minimal, but the nature of data harvesting and exfiltration strongly suggest malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a data stealer, extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal information from browsers, Discord, and user directories. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs and crypto libraries, then uploads collected data via HTTP requests to external services. The code also attempts to kill processes associated with wallet and browser applications before creating zip archives of targeted files and uploading them. It uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks simultaneously. The inclusion of hardcoded webhook URLs and external file hosting links further confirms its malicious intent. The code exhibits no signs of obfuscation but is structured for covert data collection, exfiltration, and possibly later use for malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a comprehensive info stealer targeting browsers, messaging apps, wallets, and personal directories. It exfiltrates sensitive user data covertly via Discord webhooks and file hosting services. Its behavior, methods, and intent classify it as malware with a high security risk and malicious potential.",
