  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser information, and files from various applications and browsers. It then exfiltrates this data to remote servers, primarily via webhooks and file uploads, indicating malicious intent to steal personal information and files.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), local files (e.g., browser storage, 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'Local State', log files), user input via regex patterns, and reading directories and files related to browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve sending collected data through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, uploading files to file hosting services ('gofile.io', 'anonfiles'), and writing data into temporary files before exfiltration. Also, executing system commands to kill processes and zip files for upload are sink points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like browser files, environment variables, and local application data; it then processes and decrypts sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies); the data is stored temporarily; then, it is sent via webhooks or uploaded files, indicating exfiltration. For example, tokens are extracted from logs, decrypted, and then sent to the webhook; passwords and cookies are extracted and uploaded or sent; files are zipped and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "The code exhibits several suspicious behaviors including: extensive data collection from multiple applications, decryption of encrypted data, use of hardcoded webhook URL, process termination commands (taskkill), multiple threading for concurrent execution, and uploading data to external servers. The code also includes functions for token validation, which could be used maliciously. It also contains various comments, obfuscated variable names, and repetitive patterns typical of malware. The presence of data exfiltration functions and active process termination are strong indicators of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info-stealer designed to harvest tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and other sensitive data from browsers and applications like Discord, Steam, and crypto wallets. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts tokens from logs, and uploads these to external servers. It uses threading to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, including zipping and uploading files. It also actively kills processes related to browsers or wallets to prevent interference. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates where the stolen data is exfiltrated. The code demonstrates obfuscation-like patterns with ambiguous variable names and repeated code blocks. The overall behavior aligns with typical malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration, with multiple points of suspicious activity including process termination, data collection, and external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious in nature, functioning as a data-stealing malware. It collects and decrypts sensitive user information from browsers, crypto wallets, and other applications, then exfiltrates the data via webhooks and file uploads. The use of process termination, decryption, multi-threading, and hardcoded webhook strongly indicates malicious intent. It is not safe to use or execute, as it poses a significant security risk to user systems.",
