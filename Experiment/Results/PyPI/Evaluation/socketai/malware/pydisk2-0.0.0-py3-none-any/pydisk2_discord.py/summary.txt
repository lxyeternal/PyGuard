  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for active data theft and exfiltration, with routines to decrypt stored credentials, extract tokens, terminate processes, and upload data to external services. The reports correctly identify these behaviors, assign maximum malware and security risk scores, and acknowledge minimal obfuscation. The scores are justified given the active malicious routines and data exfiltration activities."
