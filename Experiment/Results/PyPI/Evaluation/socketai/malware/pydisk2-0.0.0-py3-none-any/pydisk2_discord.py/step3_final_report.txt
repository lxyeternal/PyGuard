{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer targeting browser data, Discord tokens, credentials, files, and system info. It decrypts stored data, extracts tokens via regex, terminates related processes, and exfiltrates data through webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser storage files (local storage, cookies, login data), log files, directories, log lines, and user directories.",
  "sinks": "External webhooks, file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles), network requests, and process termination commands.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, logs) -> decryption routines and regex extraction -> data stored in variables -> data sent via webhooks or uploaded -> processes terminated to facilitate data collection.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal obfuscation; regex patterns slightly obfuscated but not heavily encrypted or obfuscated; hardcoded webhook URL; process termination commands; extensive data collection routines.",
  "analysis": "The code actively reads sensitive data from local storage, decrypts passwords and cookies using Windows API functions, extracts tokens via regex, and collects files from user directories. It terminates processes related to browsers and wallets before zipping and uploading data. The routines for exfiltration involve webhooks and file hosting. Threading is used for concurrent data collection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and process kills are typical malicious behaviors. The code shows minimal obfuscation, with ambiguous variable names and regex patterns, but no heavy encryption or code obfuscation techniques. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with known stealer malware, with active data theft, decryption routines, process termination, and exfiltration routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for active data theft and exfiltration, with routines to decrypt stored credentials, extract tokens, terminate processes, and upload data to external services. The reports correctly identify these behaviors, assign maximum malware and security risk scores, and acknowledge minimal obfuscation. The scores are justified given the active malicious routines and data exfiltration activities.",
