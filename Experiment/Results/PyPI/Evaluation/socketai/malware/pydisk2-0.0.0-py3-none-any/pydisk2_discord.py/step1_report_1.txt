{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data stealer targeting browsers, Discord tokens, and various files on the user's system for unauthorized data exfiltration and theft.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, browser data (local storage, cookies, login data), Discord token files, zip files, and user-specified directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. Also reads log files for tokens.",
  "sinks": "Uploads stolen data to external webhooks and file hosting services. Sends data including tokens, cookies, passwords, and files over the network.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from local system paths → collects data → zips files and sends via HTTP requests to remote webhooks or file hosts.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated regular expressions, includes multiple functions for extracting sensitive data, includes a large list of hardcoded keywords for searching files, and has functions for collecting and uploading browser, Discord, and file data. Also terminates processes related to cryptocurrency wallets and browsers before zipping data, which is suspicious. The code actively kills processes and uploads sensitive data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed for malicious purposes, with functions to steal tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications. It uses threading for concurrent operations, employs obfuscated regex patterns, and communicates with external webhooks and file hosts to exfiltrate data. The code includes functions to decrypt encrypted data (e.g., saved passwords and cookies), gather tokens from logs, and identify suspicious files based on keywords. It terminates processes related to wallets and browsers to facilitate data collection, then compresses and uploads the data. There are indicators of malicious intent, such as hardcoded webhook URLs, process termination commands, and data exfiltration functions that operate without user knowledge. Overall, the code's structure, functions, and behaviors are consistent with a remote access trojan or info-stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in nature, designed to steal sensitive user data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files) from browsers, applications, and system directories, and exfiltrate it via webhooks and file hosting services. It actively terminates processes for wallets and browsers to facilitate data collection and employs obfuscation techniques. Given its functions and behaviors, it should be considered highly malicious and dangerous.",
