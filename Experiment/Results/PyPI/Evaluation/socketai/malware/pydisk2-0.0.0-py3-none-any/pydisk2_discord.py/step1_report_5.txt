  "purpose": "This script appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories, and then exfiltrating that data via Discord webhooks and upload services. It also performs zip compression of files and uploads them to external servers, indicating potentially malicious intent for credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "User input is read from environment variables, local files (e.g., browser login data, cookies, local state files), and logs from directories specified in the paths. Data is collected from cookies, saved passwords, tokens, and files in user directories and browser storage.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and upload services (e.g., gofile.io, anonfiles). Zip files containing extracted data are uploaded to external servers, potentially leaking data.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, logs) are read and processed; sensitive data is decrypted and stored in memory; then data is sent through network requests (webhooks, file uploads). Zip archives are created from directories and uploaded; tokens are extracted from logs and used for further API requests.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is used to exfiltrate data. There are multiple functions for decrypting browser data, which are typical in stealer tools. The presence of password, cookie, token extraction, and zip file creation for exfiltration are suspicious. Use of threading for concurrent data collection and uploading, as well as aggressive directory traversal and file collection, indicates malicious intent. The code uses obfuscation-like patterns in variable names and multiple redundant import statements, but no actual obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential stealer targeting browser stored data, application data, and files across user directories. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows API and cryptography libraries. Tokens from Discord are extracted and verified before being sent to webhook URLs. The code aggressively searches directories, captures tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, compresses data, and uploads it to external hosting services. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, data exfiltration routines, and collection of user credentials strongly suggest malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation or evasion techniques are present; the code’s structure is typical of stealer malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer. It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user directories and browsers, then exfiltrates the data via Discord webhooks and upload services. Its behavior aligns with known stealer malware, and it has no legitimate purpose. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and extensive data collection confirms malicious intent.",
