      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent or backdoor activity. The high obfuscation, concealed execution, and error suppression justify high malware (0.8), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.85) scores. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised pending further payload analysis."
