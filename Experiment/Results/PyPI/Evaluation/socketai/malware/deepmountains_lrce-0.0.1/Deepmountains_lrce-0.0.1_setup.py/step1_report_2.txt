{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data but constructs a reverse shell command within the CustomInstall class's run method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded string that runs a reverse shell command, potentially allowing remote code execution and unauthorized access.",
  "flows": "During installation, the reverse shell command is created, base64-encoded, decoded, and executed via os.system, establishing a network connection back to a specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes an IP address and port for reverse shell connection; it constructs a potentially malicious reverse shell command and executes it during installation. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate command execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, when run, immediately initiates a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port. The reverse shell command is built with hardcoded IP and port, encoded with base64, then decoded and executed via os.system. This behavior is malicious, as it provides unauthorized remote access. No external inputs are used, but the execution of such a reverse shell during installation indicates malicious intent, likely a backdoor. The code does not perform any input validation or logging, increasing suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious backdoor that, upon package installation, automatically connects back to a remote host via reverse shell, representing a serious security threat. It is highly malicious and should not be used.",
