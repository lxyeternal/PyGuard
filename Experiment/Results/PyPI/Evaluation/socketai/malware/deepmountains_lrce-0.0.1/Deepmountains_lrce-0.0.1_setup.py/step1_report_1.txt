{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded IP address (LHOST), port (LPORT), and constructs a reverse shell command. It also reads environment variables via os.environ (implicitly), and uses base64 decoding of the embedded reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded reverse shell command that connects to an external IP and port, potentially allowing remote control of the host system.",
  "flows": "The code encodes the reverse shell command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow from hardcoded data to remote connection through system call.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the execution of a reverse shell command during package installation, hardcoded IP and port, and encoding of malicious command in base64 to obfuscate intent. The code is embedded directly in the setup script, which is unconventional and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and overrides the install command to include a malicious reverse shell execution. It constructs a reverse shell payload targeting a specific IP and port, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system, leading to remote access. The payload is designed to connect back and spawn a bash shell, which is a common backdoor tactic. No other benign functionality is present, and the behavior is triggered during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious; it installs a backdoor that connects to an external server during package installation. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and execution of a reverse shell suggest clear malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
