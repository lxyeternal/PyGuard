{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified remote host and port.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command is constructed and executed within the run method of the CustomInstall class, specifically via os.system after base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "os.system executes the decoded base64 string, which runs a reverse shell command, establishing a network connection to the specified LHOST and LPORT, potentially allowing remote control.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow from package installation to remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded IP address and port, constructs a reverse shell payload, encodes and executes it dynamically, which is highly unusual and suspicious for a legitimate package. The description also indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install process to run custom code after installation. It constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes this command in base64, and then decodes and executes it via os.system. This behavior is highly abnormal for standard package setup scripts. The code appears designed to establish unauthorized remote access when the package is installed, which constitutes malicious behavior. The usage of base64 encoding adds obfuscation, and the direct execution of a reverse shell payload is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during installation. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with obfuscated execution, indicate malicious intent, likely for unauthorized remote access or control.",
