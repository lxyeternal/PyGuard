{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python module and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port for the reverse shell; uses base64-encoded command; executes system command via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a decoded base64 string which runs a reverse shell command, connecting to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IP and port -> base64-encoded reverse shell command -> os.system executes the decoded command -> establishes reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a reverse shell payload embedded within the installation process, executed automatically after setup. Hardcoded external IP and port indicate malicious intent. Usage of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after running the normal installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. This command is base64-encoded to avoid immediate detection, then decoded and executed via os.system, leading to a remote connection to the attacker-controlled server. The presence of a hardcoded IP, port, and embedded reverse shell logic within the install routine strongly suggests malicious intent. Such behavior could allow unauthorized access and control of the host system. The script does not perform any benign or intended installation tasks other than executing this reverse shell payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, embedding a reverse shell that automatically executes during installation, connecting to an external server. This constitutes a severe security risk and indicates malicious behavior.",
