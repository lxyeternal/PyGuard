{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and execute a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command is constructed and executed within the CustomInstall.run() method; environment variables and socket connections are involved.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes the decoded base64-encoded string, which runs a reverse shell that connects back to a specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system(), creating a source-to-sink flow from code construction to remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port, direct execution of encoded reverse shell payload during installation, and the obfuscated execution flow are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the package setup process by extending the install command. During installation, it creates a reverse shell command pointing to a fixed IP and port, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it immediately via os.system. The use of hardcoded network parameters, encoding, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent to establish a remote backdoor. No legitimate functionality or benign purpose is evident. The code leverages the setuptools package for installation but embeds malicious code that activates on install, indicating a potential supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden reverse shell that executes during package installation, indicating malicious behavior intended to establish unauthorized remote access. The hardcoded IP, encoded payload, and immediate execution confirm malicious intent.",
