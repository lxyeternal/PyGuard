{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a malicious reverse shell during package installation, connecting to an external IP and port, serving as a backdoor.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP ('121.4.154.240') and port (4501), constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded base64 payload via os.system, establishing a network connection back to the attacker-controlled server, leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded IP and port are embedded into the reverse shell command, which is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed during the run() method, resulting in a reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious payload, execution during setup, hardcoded external IP and port, no benign functionality present.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. It constructs a shell command with hardcoded network parameters, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system, establishing a remote connection. The obfuscation is minimal but effective in hiding intent. The behavior is unequivocally malicious, providing remote control access. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated≈0.8) are consistent with this analysis. The code's actions pose a severe security threat, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing a reverse shell during installation with hardcoded network parameters and obfuscation. It represents a severe supply chain security risk and should be flagged as malicious. The scores are justified and align with the behavior observed.",
