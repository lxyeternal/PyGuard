  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, external data sources, code files, network connections, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, database queries, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via function calls, data assignments, or control flow paths, indicating potential malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, unusual code structures, unnecessary dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports lack actual code snippets, limiting definitive analysis. The reasoning in each is cautious and consistent, noting the absence of suspicious patterns, malicious activity, or obfuscation. Malware scores are uniformly zero, aligning with the lack of evidence. Security risk scores are low (0 or 0.2), but given no code, a score of 0 is more appropriate to reflect minimal risk. Confidence levels vary, appropriately reflecting the limited information. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and consistent, with scores accurately representing the uncertainty and evidence (or lack thereof).",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code snippets, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; however, risk scores should be adjusted to zero for more accuracy. The evaluations are cautious and justified given the limited data.",
