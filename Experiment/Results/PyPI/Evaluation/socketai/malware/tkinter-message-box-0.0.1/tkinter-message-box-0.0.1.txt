      "conclusion": "The code performs covert exfiltration of Telegram user data files without user consent, using hardcoded credentials and transmitting data to an external server. It is clearly malicious, warranting a maximum malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and a non-obfuscated classification. The behavior is consistent with spyware or malware, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. This code should be considered high severity and potentially dangerous."

      "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code snippets, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; however, risk scores should be adjusted to zero for more accuracy. The evaluations are cautious and justified given the limited data."
