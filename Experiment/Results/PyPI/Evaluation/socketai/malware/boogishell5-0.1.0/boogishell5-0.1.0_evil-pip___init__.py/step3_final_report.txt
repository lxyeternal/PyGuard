  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, functions, imports, environment variables, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded secrets, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like network transmission, code execution, or data storage.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec without confirmation, empty or minimal code, lack of code but high confidence assessments, potential dynamic features without evidence.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate no malicious activity, with scores reflecting benign assessments. Reports lacking code are correctly scored with high confidence and zero malware. Report 5 mentions potential risky functions like eval/exec but finds no evidence; scores are appropriate unless such functions are confirmed. The overall scoring aligns with the described code content, with low security risks and no obfuscation detected. If risky functions are present in report 5, malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately scored. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is found. Unless code in report 5 contains confirmed eval/exec or similar functions, current scores are justified. The overall security posture appears benign.",
