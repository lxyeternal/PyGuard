  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation and setup of a Python package, with potential additional functionalities not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, hardcoded strings, and potentially external inputs if present (not visible in the current snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess calls, file writes, or system commands if present in unshown parts of the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network or file system operations, possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are detected in the visible segment. However, incomplete visibility limits full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty, containing no functions, imports, or logic. Without further content, there are no identifiable sources, sinks, or suspicious flows. The absence of code makes it impossible to detect malicious behavior or security issues. Given the lack of content, no anomalies are present. The code is essentially inert and does not exhibit any malicious or insecure characteristics in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks. The code appears benign, but the assessment is limited by the lack of content.",
  "confidence": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0,
