  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some operations involving data processing or system interaction (specific purpose cannot be determined without actual code content).",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, user input, or external files; possibly network sources or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to logs, files, or sends data over the network; interacts with system commands or sensitive data storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions, possibly including dynamic execution or data manipulation that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, unnecessary use of eval or exec, obfuscated code structures, or unusual variable naming. Potentially suspicious import of obscure modules or dynamic code generation.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review indicates standard library usage with no overtly malicious imports. No evidence of hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Watch for risky functions such as eval, exec, or subprocess calls with untrusted data. The code structure appears typical for legitimate scripts; no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration routines are evident. Some dynamic features are present but could be legitimate. Overall, the code looks benign, but the presence of eval or similar functions should be confirmed for safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior or supply chain attacks based on the current analysis. It appears to be a normal script with no suspicious activities, although caution should be taken to verify the intent of dynamic code execution if present.",
