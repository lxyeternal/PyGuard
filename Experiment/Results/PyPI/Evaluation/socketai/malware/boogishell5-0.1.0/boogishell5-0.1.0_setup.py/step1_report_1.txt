  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install process.",
  "sources": "The os.system call within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the system command that opens a reverse shell connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method executes a reverse shell command, connecting to an external IP, which could lead to remote command execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system with a bash command to establish a reverse shell is unusual in standard package setup scripts and strongly indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. After performing a standard install, it executes a system call that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address, which is a common technique for remote control or data theft. This behavior is embedded directly into the package's installation process, suggesting malicious intent or sabotage. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The code's primary purpose appears to be to compromise the system during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a reverse shell during installation, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package is potentially dangerous and should not be used.",
