{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a Python package named 'boogishell5' with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and executes a custom install command via os.system during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method triggers os.system to execute a bash reverse shell, connecting to 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command includes a hardcoded reverse shell payload, which is unusual and malicious behavior. The comment suggests intentional code execution post-install.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package setup. It overrides the install command to run a system command that initiates a reverse shell to an external IP. This behavior is typical of malicious package sabotage or malware, as it grants remote access to the attacker. The code does not perform any other suspicious actions or obfuscation. The presence of a reverse shell in the post-install step is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior: a hardcoded reverse shell initiated during package installation, indicating compromise or sabotage. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
