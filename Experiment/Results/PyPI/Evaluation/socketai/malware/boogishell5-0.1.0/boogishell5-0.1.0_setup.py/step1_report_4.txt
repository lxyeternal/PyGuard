{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation process for a Python package named 'boogishell5' using setuptools, including a custom post-install command.",
  "sources": "The custom post-install command executes a system call via os.system() that runs a Bash reverse shell command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call acts as a sink where untrusted data (the Bash command string) is executed, which could lead to remote code execution or backdoor access.",
  "flows": "The flow begins at the custom run() method, executing the os.system() command after installation, which establishes a reverse shell connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system() to run a reverse shell command during installation is highly unusual and suspicious; this behavior is indicative of malicious intent or backdoor setup. The code comments and structure do not suggest any legitimate purpose for this action.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines a custom install command that overrides the run() method. After performing the standard installation, it executes a Bash reverse shell command, connecting back to a specified IP and port. This behavior is not typical for package installation and is a clear sign of malicious intent. The setup configuration itself appears normal, but the post-install hook is malicious. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior, specifically a backdoor reverse shell triggered during installation. This code is intended to compromise the host system by establishing a remote connection, which is a security threat.",
