{
  "purpose": "The setup script is intended to install a Python package named 'boogishell5' with a custom install process.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and executes a custom install command, specifically the 'os.system' call.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777, which could lead to unauthorized access.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes a reverse shell command, creating a source-to-sink flow from the installation process to remote command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The 'os.system' command runs a reverse shell payload during installation, which is highly unusual and malicious behavior. The comment indicates it is intentionally executing a reverse shell, which is a red flag.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools modules and defines a custom install command. In the overridden 'run' method, after executing the normal installation, it runs a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to a specific IP address and port. This behavior is malicious, as it allows remote attackers to gain access to the system during package installation. The rest of the setup code is standard for package distribution, but the presence of a reverse shell command makes the package malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection during installation. The reverse shell payload is embedded directly in the setup script's custom install command, indicating malicious intent and compromise of supply chain security.",
