  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The custom install command reads no external data but executes a system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code runs os.system with a bash reverse shell command, which connects to 114.116.119.253 on port 7777, potentially exfiltrating data or controlling the system.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install script executes a reverse shell without any user warning or condition, indicating malicious intent. The use of os.system to run a potentially harmful command is suspicious. No other malicious code is present, but this behavior is highly unusual for a legitimate package.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after the standard installation, executes a bash reverse shell connection to a specific external IP and port. This behavior is a common technique for establishing unauthorized remote access. The use of os.system to invoke bash directly is dangerous and indicates malicious activity. The package name and description appear benign, but the reverse shell code reveals malicious intent. No other suspicious or malicious code is detected outside this post-install script.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior in the form of a post-install reverse shell that connects to an external IP. This indicates a supply chain attack or malicious package designed to compromise systems upon installation. The presence of such code warrants immediate review and removal from distribution channels.",
