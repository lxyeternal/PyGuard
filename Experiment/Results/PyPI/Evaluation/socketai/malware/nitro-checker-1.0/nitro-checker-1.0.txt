      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly obfuscated malicious payload that executes arbitrary code, makes network requests to suspicious domains, and manipulates environment variables. All evidence points to a supply chain security compromise. The scores should be set to maximum (malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1). It should be flagged and removed from any environment to prevent harm."

      "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious intent."
