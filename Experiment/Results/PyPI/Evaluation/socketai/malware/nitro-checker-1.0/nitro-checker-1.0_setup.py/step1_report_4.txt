{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'nitro-checker' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads from base64-encoded string executed via an exec call, imports modules (setuptools, base64, sys, os, tempfile, ssl, urllib.request, _ssl, sys, and urllib.parse). It also reads environment variables and makes network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via urllib.request and ssl modules; potentially writes to temporary files; uses environment variables which could leak data or be manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code decodes and executes obfuscated code that imports network modules and environment variables, then performs a GET request to 'https://z3us.online/grab/myOxGLuqZNlRESL'. It also reads environment variables and possibly writes or processes data based on them.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated code executed via 'exec' is suspicious. The decoded code contacts a suspicious domain, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The presence of dynamically executed code and network activity indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The initial code imports standard setup functions, then executes a large base64-encoded string decoded into code that imports network modules and makes a network request to a suspicious domain. It also reads environment variables, possibly for data exfiltration or configuration. The obfuscation via base64 decoding and dynamic execution is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide intentions. The network request to a potentially malicious domain strongly indicates malicious activity. The setup function appears standard but is likely used to mask malicious behavior in the payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that contacts a suspicious external domain, indicating malicious intent. The use of exec and base64 decoding to hide network activity is highly suspicious. The overall security risk is high due to the malicious network request embedded within the setup script.",
