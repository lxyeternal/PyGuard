{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'nitro-checker' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and executed at the beginning of the script; package list and metadata defined in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Decoded code executes dynamic import and execution of potentially arbitrary code, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The initial code is heavily obfuscated via base64 decoding and dynamic execution, which is unusual and suspicious for a simple setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and then executes a decoded base64 string. The decoded string imports 'tempfile' and 'web' modules, executes a request to a suspicious URL ('https://z3us.online/grab/miYOxGLuqZNlRELS'), and manipulates environment variables. It appears to fetch external code and possibly execute it, which is highly suspicious in a setup context. The obfuscation and remote URL indicate potential malicious intent, such as downloading and executing malicious payloads. The remaining setup() call appears standard but is likely overshadowed by the initial malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution that contacts an external server, indicating malicious intent. The initial payload's purpose is likely to download and execute malicious code, which is a supply chain risk. This code is malicious and should not be used or trusted.",
