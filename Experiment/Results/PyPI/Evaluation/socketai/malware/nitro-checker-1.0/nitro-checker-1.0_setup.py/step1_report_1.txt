    "The code appears to import standard modules but then executes an obfuscated payload"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with a straightforward setup() function defining package metadata, which is typical. However, immediately after, it executes a multi-line string containing obfuscated code. This code is base64-encoded, decoded at runtime, compiled, and executed via exec(). This pattern is suspicious because it hides the true nature of the code being run. The decoded payload imports standard libraries but then proceeds to perform potentially malicious operations, such as executing arbitrary code or making network requests. The obfuscation and use of exec() on decoded content strongly suggest malicious intent or malicious payload concealment. No benign or necessary functionality justifies such obfuscation. Overall, this indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior or at least malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed at runtime, which is a common tactic for hiding malicious activities. The initial setup appears normal, but the embedded code suggests the potential for malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, network communication, or data exfiltration. This pattern raises significant security concerns, and the package should be treated with caution.",
