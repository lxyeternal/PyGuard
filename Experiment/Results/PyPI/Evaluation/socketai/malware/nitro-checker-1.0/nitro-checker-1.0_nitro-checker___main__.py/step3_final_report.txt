  "purpose": "A simple function that prints a static message indicating successful installation of a 'nitro-checker'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function only prints a static message without external data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a fixed message. It involves no external inputs, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reviews agree on its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's trivial and transparent nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
