  "purpose": "Initialize module by importing the 'reverse_shell' function from the 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.main' module to bring in 'reverse_shell'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from the 'main' module to the current namespace; no data flow from external input.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'reverse_shell' suggests potential for malicious activity; the name indicates functionality that could be used maliciously, but the code itself does not execute or implement it.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a function named 'reverse_shell' from a local module. While the function name could imply malicious intent, the code itself only performs an import operation without executing or revealing any malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or other suspicious patterns. Without additional context or implementation details of 'reverse_shell', this snippet alone is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior but imports a function whose name suggests potential for malicious use. It requires further context to assess risk fully. Based solely on this, the risk appears low.",
