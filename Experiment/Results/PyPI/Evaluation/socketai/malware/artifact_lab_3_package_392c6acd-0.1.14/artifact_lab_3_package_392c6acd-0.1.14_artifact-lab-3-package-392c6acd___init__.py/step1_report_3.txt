  "purpose": "Import the reverse_shell function from the main module, likely to provide reverse shell capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module",
  "sinks": "Potential invocation of reverse_shell function (not shown in this snippet)",
  "flows": "Importing reverse_shell could lead to execution if called elsewhere, but no direct execution here",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code simply re-exports the reverse_shell function from the main module. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscated code. The presence of a reverse shell function itself could be concerning if invoked improperly, but the code here only shows an import statement with no execution context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code, there is no direct malicious behavior. The presence of a reverse_shell function is potentially dangerous if invoked, but the code itself is benign. No malicious intent or suspicious anomalies detected in this snippet.",
