{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'reverse_shell' function from a local module, likely to be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only makes the function available for later use.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'reverse_shell' is suspicious and suggests potential malicious intent, but no malicious activity is present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with no execution, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code. The function name indicates potential misuse if invoked, but the snippet alone is benign. The malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting potential if the function is called elsewhere. Obfuscation score is 0, as the code is straightforward. Confidence in these conclusions is high, given the simplicity of the code and lack of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not constitute malicious activity. The primary concern is how 'reverse_shell' is used elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, the code is benign. Scores should reflect low malware and risk levels, with high confidence.",
