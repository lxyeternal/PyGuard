  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'reverse_shell' function from the 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import reverse_shell",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'reverse_shell' if invoked elsewhere, but no direct sink in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable in this snippet; no function calls or data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward import statement with no embedded malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a simple import of 'reverse_shell' from the local 'main' module. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code. No data input/output, network connections, or obfuscated code present. The presence of a 'reverse_shell' function suggests functionality related to reverse shells, which could be used maliciously, but in this context, the code itself is just an import statement with no active behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization file with no direct malicious activity. However, the imported 'reverse_shell' could be dangerous if invoked elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.",
