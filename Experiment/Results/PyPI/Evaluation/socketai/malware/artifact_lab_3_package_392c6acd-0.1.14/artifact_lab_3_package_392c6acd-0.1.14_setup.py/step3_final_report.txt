  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file; static data in setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Reading file -> passing content to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file read and setup call",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a README.md file and calls setup() with basic metadata. It does not contain any dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
