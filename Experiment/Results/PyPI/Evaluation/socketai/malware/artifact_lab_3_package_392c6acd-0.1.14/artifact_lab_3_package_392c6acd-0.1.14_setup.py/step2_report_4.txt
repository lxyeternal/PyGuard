  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- It reads a README.md file with no suspicious or malicious content.\n- The setup() parameters are standard, with no dependencies, secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is consistent since there's no obfuscation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified; the code is standard and correct.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0 is appropriate, given the benign nature.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities, as the code is purely for package setup.\n- **Suspicious behaviors:** None observed or claimed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, benign setup script with no security issues.",
