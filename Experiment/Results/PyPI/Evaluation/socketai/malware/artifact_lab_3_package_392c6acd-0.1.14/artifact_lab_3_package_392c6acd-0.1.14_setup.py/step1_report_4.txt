{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; calling find_packages() to identify packages to include.",
  "writes": "No data is written or outputted; no untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README.md file to include as long_description, and calls setup() with standard parameters. There are no external inputs beyond reading a static file, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behaviors. Dependencies list is empty, reducing attack surface. Overall, it appears to be a typical package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
