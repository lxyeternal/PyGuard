  "conclusion": "The code functions as a malicious reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control of the compromised system. It uses hardcoded connection details, no authentication, and straightforward shell invocation, making it a high-severity security threat. The malware score is justified as 1, obfuscation is 0, and overall security risk is 1."
