{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it during installation on Windows systems, likely to run malicious code or backdoors.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information via os.name, imports requests and Fernet modules, and decrypts a hardcoded ciphertext with a hardcoded key.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed directly via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "On Windows (os.name == 'nt'), the code imports modules, decrypts the payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(), leading to potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded cryptographic key and encrypted payload, obfuscated class name, conditional execution only on Windows, and dynamic execution of decrypted code.",
  "analysis": "The code's behavior involves decrypting a concealed payload and executing it during setup on Windows, which is a common pattern for malicious backdoors. The use of encrypted data, obfuscated class names, and runtime execution indicates malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given the high potential for harm. No logical errors are present; the analysis correctly identifies the malicious pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to decrypt and execute hidden code during installation on Windows. The high scores and reasoning are justified, and the package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
