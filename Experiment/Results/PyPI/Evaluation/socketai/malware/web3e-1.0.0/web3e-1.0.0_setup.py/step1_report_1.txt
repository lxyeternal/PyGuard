{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom install command that decrypts and executes code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'requests', 'fernet', reads environment variables, hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially malicious payload.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, 'exec()' runs decrypted code obtained via Fernet from hardcoded key and encrypted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, execution of decrypted code via exec() without validation, custom install command that decrypts and runs code, no checks for the decrypted content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package 'web3e' with a custom install class. During installation on Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code with 'exec()'. The decryption process indicates intentional concealment of code, and 'exec()' allows arbitrary code execution, which can be malicious. The use of 'exec()' with decrypted payload on Windows is a common tactic to hide malicious activities such as backdoors, system modification, or data exfiltration. No other suspicious library usage is detected, but the deliberate obfuscation and execution of decrypted code raise serious security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing code on Windows during installation, which could be used to run malicious payloads. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and encrypted code indicates malicious intent to conceal activities. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
