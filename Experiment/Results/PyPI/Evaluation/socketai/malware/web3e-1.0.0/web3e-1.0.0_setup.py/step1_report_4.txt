{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'web3e' with specific metadata and a custom install command that executes decryption and code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), package setup parameters, and executes decrypted code within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code that could lead to arbitrary code execution, especially during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('nt'), the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom install command that executes decrypted code at install time; presence of encrypted payload and the use of 'exec' with decrypted data; no clear purpose for decryption step other than executing hidden code; encrypted string and key are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package setup parameters with obfuscated class name and encrypted payload. During installation on Windows, it decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using Fernet with a hardcoded key, then executes it with exec(). The decrypted code is unknown but potentially malicious as it is encrypted and executed dynamically, which is suspicious. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data is a common technique for malicious payloads. The code includes potentially malicious behavior such as executing arbitrary code during setup, which could be used for system compromise or malicious actions. The rest of the code involves standard package setup with no suspicious dependencies or behaviors, but the critical concern is the dynamic execution of decrypted code during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern of decrypting and executing code during installation, which indicates malicious intent or malicious payload delivery. The hardcoded encryption key and payload further suggest obfuscation and malicious activity. Overall, this package should be considered highly malicious and unsafe for use.",
