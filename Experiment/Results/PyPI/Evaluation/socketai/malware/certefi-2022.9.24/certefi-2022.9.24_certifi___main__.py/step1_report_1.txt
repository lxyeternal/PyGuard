{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface to access certificate authority bundle information, either printing the contents or the location of the CA bundle.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments to determine user request; imports from certifi module to access 'contents' and 'where' functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the results of certifi functions to standard output, which is generally safe; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "User supplies a command-line argument; depending on the argument, the code calls either 'contents()' or 'where()' from certifi and prints the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and uses standard, well-maintained library functions without obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to handle command-line arguments, and based on a boolean flag, it calls either certifi.contents() or certifi.where(). Both functions are standard parts of the certifi library, designed to provide trusted CA bundle information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The functions used do not accept untrusted input and only return static or internally managed data. The overall structure is simple, with no complex logic or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for retrieving certificate bundle information via certifi. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk within this code snippet.",
