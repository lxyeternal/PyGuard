{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to access certificate bundle information from the 'certifi' library, allowing users to either retrieve the contents of the certificate bundle or its location.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument '-c' or '--contents' to determine which function to call.",
  "sinks": "Printing functions 'print(contents())' and 'print(where())', which output data to the console.",
  "flows": "User provides argument -> 'args.contents' condition checked -> if true, 'contents()' output is printed -> else, 'where()' output is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution; straightforward use of a known library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'argparse' for argument parsing and 'certifi' functions 'contents' and 'where'. It offers a command-line option '-c' or '--contents'. If this option is set, it prints the contents of the certificate bundle; otherwise, it prints the location of the certificate bundle. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The use of 'certifi' functions is standard and safe, serving typical certificate management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility for displaying certificate bundle information, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only interacts with known, trusted library functions and handles user input in a straightforward manner.",
