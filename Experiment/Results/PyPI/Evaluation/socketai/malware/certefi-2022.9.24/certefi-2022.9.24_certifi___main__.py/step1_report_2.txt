{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide information about the 'certifi' package, specifically either its contents or its installation location, based on user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads user command-line arguments via argparse, and uses functions 'contents()' and 'where()' from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The code prints information obtained from 'certifi.contents()' or 'certifi.where()', which are safe functions returning package data and location; these are output functions, not sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line argument '--contents' -> code calls 'contents()' or 'where()' -> results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; usage of standard functions from a well-known library with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'certifi' and its functions 'contents' and 'where'. It sets up argument parsing to accept a '--contents' flag. If this flag is present, it prints the contents of the certifi package; otherwise, it prints the installation path of certifi. Both functions are from the 'certifi' library, which is commonly used to provide SSL root certificates. The code does not process or handle untrusted input data beyond command-line arguments, nor does it perform any network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to display information about the certifi package. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign and safe piece of code.",
