{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line utility to display either the contents of the certifi CA bundle or its installation path, based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments and calls trusted functions `certifi.contents()` and `certifi.where()`.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data retrieved from trusted functions; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line flag) determines which trusted function output is printed; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard, well-maintained library functions to provide static package information. It does not process untrusted input beyond command-line flags, nor does it perform network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The functions used are safe and do not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The minimal security risk score in the reports (0.1) overestimates the benign nature of this code; a score of 0 is more appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe utility that retrieves and displays trusted package information without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature; minor adjustments to the security risk score (setting it to 0) would improve consistency.",
