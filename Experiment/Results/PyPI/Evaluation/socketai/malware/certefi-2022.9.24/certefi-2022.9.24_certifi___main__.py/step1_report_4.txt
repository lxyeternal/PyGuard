{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface to either display the contents of the 'certifi' package or its installation path.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line argument '--contents'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' functions output data retrieved from 'certifi' functions, potentially exposing package contents or paths.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--contents' triggers retrieval of 'contents()' or 'where()', and their output is printed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard 'certifi' functions is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'argparse' to parse a command-line argument. If '--contents' is specified, it calls 'certifi.contents()' and prints the result; otherwise, it prints the installation directory with 'certifi.where()'. Both functions are part of the public API of 'certifi' and are used for retrieving trusted CA bundle data and installation path. No untrusted data sources, no external network communication, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs simple data retrieval and output with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and designed for informational purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
