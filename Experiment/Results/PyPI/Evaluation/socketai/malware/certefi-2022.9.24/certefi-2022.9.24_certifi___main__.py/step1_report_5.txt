{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface to output information about the 'certifi' package, either its contents or its installation path.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line argument '--contents' or its absence, which determines which function to call.",
  "sinks": "The functions 'contents()' and 'where()' are called based on user input; these functions access package data and filesystem paths, respectively.",
  "flows": "User runs script with or without '--contents' flag -> conditional check -> calls either 'contents()' or 'where()' -> outputs result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of 'certifi' functions is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to determine whether to display the contents of the 'certifi' package or its installation path. Both functions are from the 'certifi' package, which is a well-known, reputable library for SSL certificate validation. No input from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments. No suspicious code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors observed. Functions used are read-only and intended for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign utility for inspecting the 'certifi' package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides user information about a trusted library.",
