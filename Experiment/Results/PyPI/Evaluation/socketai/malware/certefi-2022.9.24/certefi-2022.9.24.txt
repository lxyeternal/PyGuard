      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of os.system() for publishing, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but in its current form, it is safe. The typo in the package name should be corrected for clarity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the os.system() usage."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation for locating and reading a static resource ('cacert.pem') within the 'certifi' package. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is justified given the context."

All reports correctly identify its benign nature; minor adjustments to the security risk score (setting it to 0) would improve consistency."
