{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to locate and read the 'cacert.pem' certificate bundle in different Python environments.",
  "sources": "Reads from the package resources 'certifi' to locate 'cacert.pem'; reads the content of 'cacert.pem' from the filesystem or package resource.",
  "sinks": "Reading the certificate content from files; no direct untrusted input handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The functions 'where()' determine the path to 'cacert.pem'; 'contents()' reads the file content after location is determined. No untrusted input is processed; flows are static file access.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Code manages resource cleanup via context managers properly, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages resource locating using 'importlib.resources' depending on Python version, with appropriate handling of context managers and fallback methods. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is evident. The code is straightforward, focusing on locating and reading a static resource, with proper version-specific handling. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign resource locator and reader for 'cacert.pem'. It handles different Python versions appropriately and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
