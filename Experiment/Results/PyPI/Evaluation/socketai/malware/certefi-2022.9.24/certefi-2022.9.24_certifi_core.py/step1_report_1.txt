  "purpose": "Provides functions to locate and read the 'cacert.pem' file within the 'certifi' package, supporting multiple Python versions and environments.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'cacert.pem' resource from the 'certifi' package via importlib.resources or from the filesystem using __file__.",
  "sinks": "Reads the contents of 'cacert.pem' via open() when fallback method is used.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the file path or contents from the package resources or filesystem based on Python version; the fallback reads directly from disk, which could be influenced if 'where()' is manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; the fallback relies on 'where()' to determine file location, which is standard. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching observed. The resource management with __enter__() and __exit__() appears correct.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'importlib.resources' based on Python version to locate 'cacert.pem' within the 'certifi' package, implementing delayed extraction and resource cleanup. The fallback uses file path logic based on __file__, and a read_text function to read the file contents. All operations are standard package resource handling and file I/O with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is reliance on 'where()' for path determination in fallback, but it is consistent with typical package resource access. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate resource locator and reader for 'cacert.pem' within the 'certifi' package. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It employs proper resource management and version compatibility practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
