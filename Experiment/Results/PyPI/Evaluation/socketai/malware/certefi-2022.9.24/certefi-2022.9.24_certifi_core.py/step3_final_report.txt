{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to locate and read 'cacert.pem' within the 'certifi' package across different Python versions, managing resources efficiently.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'cacert.pem' from the 'certifi' package using importlib.resources or filesystem paths, depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "The code reads the contents of 'cacert.pem' into memory; no untrusted data input or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function determines the file path, which is then used by 'contents()' to read the file content into memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Resource management via context managers is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard resource access methods for different Python versions, with proper cleanup and fallback mechanisms. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leakage are present. The resource handling is correct and follows best practices. The minor risk score in some reports reflects the reliance on filesystem paths, but this is typical for such utility functions and does not indicate security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation for locating and reading a static resource ('cacert.pem') within the 'certifi' package. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is justified given the context.",
