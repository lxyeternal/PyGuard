{
  "purpose": "Provide the file path or contents of the 'cacert.pem' certificate bundle within the certifi package, depending on Python version and environment.",
  "sources": "Reading of the 'cacert.pem' file via importlib.resources or filesystem based on Python version; also the 'where()' function that determines the file path.",
  "sinks": "Reading the certificate file contents using open() or importlib.resources functions; no external network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function determines the file path based on the environment, then 'contents()' reads the file contents. The flow is straightforward: path determination -> file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of importlib.resources for resource management is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code adapts its resource access depending on Python version, utilizing importlib.resources where available, and falling back to filesystem paths otherwise. It manages resource cleanup via context managers, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The functions are read-only and relate solely to retrieving the 'cacert.pem' file contents or location. No external network connections or data exfiltration activities are present. The logic is consistent with package resource handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management implementation for accessing 'cacert.pem' within the 'certifi' package. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. It appears safe and aligned with common package resource handling practices.",
