  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation for locating and reading a static resource ('cacert.pem') within the 'certifi' package. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is justified given the context."
