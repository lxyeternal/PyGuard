  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of os.system() for publishing, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but in its current form, it is safe. The typo in the package name should be corrected for clarity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the os.system() usage."
