  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'certifi' Python library, including version extraction and optional publishing.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'certifi/__init__.py'; uses sys.argv to detect 'publish' command.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload' via os.system when 'publish' is invoked.",
  "flows": "Version regex extraction from file → detection of 'publish' argument → execution of static shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a static command; typo in package name ('certefi' instead of 'certifi'); no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with version reading via regex, and conditionally runs a shell command for publishing. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The use of os.system() is a potential security concern if inputs are manipulated, but here it executes a fixed command, minimizing risk. The typo in the package name is a minor issue but not security-related. Overall, the code is straightforward and typical for setup scripts, with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of os.system() for publishing, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but in its current form, it is safe. The typo in the package name should be corrected for clarity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the os.system() usage.",
