  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, with suspicious URL and error suppression. It should be considered malicious or compromised until further decoding of the payload confirms benign intent."
