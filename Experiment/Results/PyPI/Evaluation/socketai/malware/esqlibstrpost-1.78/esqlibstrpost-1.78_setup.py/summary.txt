  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, representing a significant security threat. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The high scores in the reports are justified given the evidence, and the activity warrants caution or removal from distribution until further decoding confirms malicious payloads."
