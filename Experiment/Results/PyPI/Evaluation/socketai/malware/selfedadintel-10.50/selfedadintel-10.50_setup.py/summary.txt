  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious indicators, notably the execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package installation. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, and their scores are appropriate. The package should be treated as malicious, and further analysis of the payload is recommended."
