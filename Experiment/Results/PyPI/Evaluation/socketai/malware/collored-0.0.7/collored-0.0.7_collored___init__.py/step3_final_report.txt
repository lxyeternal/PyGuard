  "anomalies": "Typo in __all__ list ('collored' instead of 'colored').",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module re-export pattern, importing 'init' from a local module named 'collored' and defining __all__ to include 'collored'. The only anomaly is the typo in __all__, which is likely an oversight. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or system modifications. The typo does not impact security but could cause runtime import errors if the module does not exist. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting the minor typo but no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export with a minor typo. No malicious intent or obfuscation is present. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly remains at 0. The typo should be corrected for clarity, but it does not pose a security threat.",
