  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a decrypted code block on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The import statements, the Fernet decryption and exec call within the install class, and the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "The exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...)) line which executes decrypted code, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts and executes an external code payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated long strings in Fernet decryption, execution of decrypted code via exec, dynamic behavior limited to Windows, no visible source of the encrypted payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package named 'PyGamne'. In the custom install class, it checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it. The encrypted string appears intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious. Executing decrypted code during package installation is a security concern as it can run arbitrary malicious code. The use of long, unintelligible strings and conditional execution on Windows indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity. No other malicious indicators like hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or suspicious network connections are directly visible outside the decrypted payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior: decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows systems, which could lead to malicious activity such as remote code execution. The obfuscation and runtime code execution are strong indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
