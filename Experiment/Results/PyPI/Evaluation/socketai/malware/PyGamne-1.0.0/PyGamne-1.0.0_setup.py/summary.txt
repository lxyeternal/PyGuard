  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates highly suspicious behavior, decrypting and executing code during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious backdoors or payloads. The obfuscation and encrypted payloads further support malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores assigned by the reports are justified and accurately reflect the security threat posed by this package."
