{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'PyGamne' with custom installation behavior, including executing decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes dynamically decrypted code using 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec', which could run malicious payloads, especially since the code decrypts and executes potentially obfuscated content.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment info -> decrypts and executes remote or embedded payload during installation if on Windows -> potential execution of malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of encrypted data and its decryption followed by 'exec' is suspicious. The long, random-looking description strings and the complex class name are obfuscated indicators. The code dynamically executes code fetched or embedded within the package, which is unusual for normal setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with an unusual custom 'install' command class. This class decrypts a string using Fernet symmetric encryption and executes it if the target OS is Windows. The code uses a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, which raises suspicion of malicious intent, such as executing hidden backdoors or malicious scripts during installation. The overall structure and encrypted payload usage are atypical for benign setup scripts and indicate obfuscated behavior aimed at executing arbitrary code upon installation on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload execution during the installation process on Windows, which is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious behavior. It may execute arbitrary code during package installation, representing a significant security risk.",
