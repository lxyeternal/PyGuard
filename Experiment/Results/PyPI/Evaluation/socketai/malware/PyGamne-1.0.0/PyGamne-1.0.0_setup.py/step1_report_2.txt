{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'PyGamne', including custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules like os, requests, fernet, and executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via exec() which may be malicious; uses requests and Fernet for cryptography.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it, which could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed at install time, use of exec() on decrypted data, obfuscated strings and long nonsensical descriptions, suspicious import of 'fernet' and 'requests' with setup_requires. The class name and variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to conceal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that includes an obfuscated class and data. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a payload with exec(), which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The use of encrypted data and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The code does not perform any benign setup functions beyond package configuration but primarily focuses on executing hidden code during install.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code at installation time on Windows, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation and use of cryptographic functions further support this conclusion.",
