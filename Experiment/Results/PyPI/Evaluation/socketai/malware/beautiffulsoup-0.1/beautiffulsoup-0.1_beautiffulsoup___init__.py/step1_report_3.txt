{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform data processing or utility functions based on the code structure.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external libraries; no explicit user input or network sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include file writes, console prints, or external API calls via imported libraries; no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs or environment variables through processing functions, with no evident untrusted data reaching critical sinks like network connections or file system writes without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. There are no obfuscated code constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard and justified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Python functions and module usage. There are no signs of malicious logic such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward. No unusual code patterns or suspicious behaviors are detected. The absence of external network activity, encrypted data handling, or system modifications suggests no malicious intent. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, and its operations seem consistent with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It seems safe for use, assuming the external libraries are also trustworthy.",
