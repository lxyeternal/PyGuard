  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, module imports, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and untrusted data to sinks like network or file system, potentially via eval/exec or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/credentials, high obfuscation scores, suspicious data flows, inconsistent comments with code complexity.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no malicious patterns, low obfuscation, and minimal security risk, supported by high confidence scores. Report 4 exhibits signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.8), and security risk (0.7) scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. Minor inconsistency noted in the description of obfuscation in Report 4, but scores are justified by indicators. Overall, the assessments align with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign, with one report indicating potential malicious activity justified by dynamic execution and obfuscation. The scores are consistent and appropriate. Additional dynamic analysis of suspicious code is recommended for confirmation.",
