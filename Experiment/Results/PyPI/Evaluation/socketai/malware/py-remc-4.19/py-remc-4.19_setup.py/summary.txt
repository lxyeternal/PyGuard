  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, likely for malicious purposes such as remote payload download or execution. The obfuscation, silent error handling, and reference to a suspicious URL indicate a high probability of malware. The package should be treated as malicious until further decoding and analysis of the payload confirm its intent."
