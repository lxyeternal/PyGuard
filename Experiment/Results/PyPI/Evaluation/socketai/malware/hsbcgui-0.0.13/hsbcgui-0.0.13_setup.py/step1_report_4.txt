{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'hsbcgui' package that installs dependencies and executes a platform-specific application download and launch.",
  "sources": "The code reads external dependencies via 'requests.get' to download a file from a URL when on Windows platform.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file ('DigitalPulse.exe') is executed directly via 'os.system' which runs the file on the system.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts with the setup, then during installation (PostInstallCommand), it calls 'app()', which downloads an executable from a remote server and launches it immediately.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic downloading and execution of an external executable during package installation, which is highly suspicious and atypical for a legitimate setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally downloads an executable from a remote URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') when run on Windows. It then immediately executes this file using 'os.system'. This behavior resembles malware, as it involves remote code retrieval and execution during package installation, which could be malicious or unwanted. There are no obfuscation indicators, but the act itself is a major security concern. The code does not validate or sandbox the downloaded file, and the URL appears suspicious. The use of try-except without specific error handling masks potential errors, further hiding malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during installation, which is a security risk. It appears designed to silently run potentially harmful software when the package is installed on Windows systems.",
