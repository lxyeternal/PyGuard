{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a post-install action to download and execute an external executable on Windows.",
  "sources": "The 'app()' function which is called during post-install, it makes an HTTP request to download an executable from an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call which executes the downloaded executable ('DigitalPulse.exe') on Windows.",
  "flows": "The code downloads 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a specified URL, saves it locally, and then executes it via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable during installation without any user interaction or validation. The URL used ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') appears suspicious, and the execution of a downloaded file poses a high security risk.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, but it includes a malicious-looking post-install step. When run on Windows, it downloads an executable from a remote server and runs it without verification, which could allow remote code execution or malware installation. The use of 'try-except' without logging or error handling conceals potential errors. The code does not check the content or integrity of the downloaded file, and executing external code in this manner is highly dangerous. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent or at least very poor security practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable during installation without any validation, representing a supply chain security threat. This behavior is typical of malicious or compromised packages attempting to run arbitrary code on the target system.",
