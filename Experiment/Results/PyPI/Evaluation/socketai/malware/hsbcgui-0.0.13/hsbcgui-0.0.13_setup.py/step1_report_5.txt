{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and includes a post-installation script that downloads and executes an external executable file on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network using requests.get() to fetch an executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved locally and then executed via os.system('start ' + filename).",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() retrieves external content -> file write to 'DigitalPulse.exe' -> os.system() executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external binary during installation without user consent or verification, which is suspicious behavior. The URL used ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') could be malicious. The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'hsbcgui'. It includes a custom post-install class that runs the 'app()' function. The 'app()' function, only on Windows, fetches an executable from a remote server and executes it immediately after installation. The download and execution occur silently and without verification, indicating potential malicious intent. This behavior resembles malicious supply chain activity, such as downloading and executing malicious payloads during installation. The code lacks any safeguards like checksum verification or user confirmation, increasing security risk. The URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote binary during installation, which poses a significant security threat. The pattern suggests possible malware delivery or backdoor installation. Immediate review or removal is advised.",
