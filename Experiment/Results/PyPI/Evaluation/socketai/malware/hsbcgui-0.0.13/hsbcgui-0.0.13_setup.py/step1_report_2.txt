  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that also includes a post-install action to download and execute an external executable file on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Requests library call to download external file; code execution via os.system with downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the downloaded 'DigitalPulse.exe' file on Windows.",
  "flows": "requests.get -> write file -> os.system('start '+filename) to execute the downloaded executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of an external executable during installation on Windows; no user prompt or validation; exception handling is broad and silent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process that, upon installation on Windows, fetches an executable from a remote URL and runs it automatically. This behavior is embedded within a custom install command, triggered during package installation. The use of requests to download and execute an external binary without user consent or validation indicates potential malicious activity. The silent exception handling does not alert users to failures. Such actions could be used for malicious remote control, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code does not perform any verification of the downloaded content, making it highly suspicious. No obfuscated code, but the intent to download and execute code dynamically during install is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk behavior by downloading and executing an external executable automatically on Windows systems during package installation. This is indicative of malicious or backdoor functionality, with potential for remote control or malware distribution. The overall security risk is very high, and usage of this package should be avoided.",
