{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an external executable ('DigitalPulse.exe') during Windows package installation without validation or user consent.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' is fetched via requests.get(), and the executable is saved locally as 'DigitalPulse.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The code uses os.system('start '+filename) to execute the downloaded file, which can lead to remote code execution or malware installation.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the executable from the URL; the file is saved locally; os.system() runs the executable immediately, executing remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution during install, silent error handling (try-except: pass), no validation or user prompt, suspicious external URL, embedded within setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a high-risk operation by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation on Windows. The broad exception handling conceals errors, and no validation is performed on the downloaded file. This pattern resembles malicious activity such as malware distribution or backdoor setup. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but it introduces a severe security vulnerability. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics, risking remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code without validation or user consent. It should be classified as malicious, with a malware score of 1, and a security risk score of 1. The package poses a severe security threat and should be avoided or removed.",
