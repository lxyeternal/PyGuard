  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'It Works' with no external data or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign function with no external dependencies, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and lack of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
