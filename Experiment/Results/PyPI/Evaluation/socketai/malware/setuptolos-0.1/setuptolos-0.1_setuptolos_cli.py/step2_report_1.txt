  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. Code Verification:\n- The original code is:\n```python\ndef cli():\n    print(\"It Works\")\n```\n- All reports correctly describe this as a simple function that prints a static message. There are no external inputs, data flows, or complex logic.\n\n2. Presence of Issues:\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- There are no errors, flaws, or mistakes in the code logic or reasoning within the reports.\n\n3. Evaluation of Scores:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only prints a static message with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs, a security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n5. Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n6. Consistency:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n7. Personal Estimate:\n- Based on the analysis, I agree with the provided scores.\n- I would assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - risk: 0\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a trivial, benign function with no security issues.\n- The reports accurately reflect this.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0",
