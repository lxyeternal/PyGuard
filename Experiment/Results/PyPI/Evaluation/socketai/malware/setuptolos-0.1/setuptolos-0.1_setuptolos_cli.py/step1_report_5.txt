  "purpose": "A simple command-line interface function that prints 'It Works'.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the function only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function 'cli' only outputs a static string to the console and does not perform any input/output operations involving external data. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or cause harm, and no complex or suspicious logic. It appears to be a straightforward, benign placeholder or test function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs a fixed message and does not interact with external data sources or perform any suspicious actions.",
