  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward `print(\"It Works\")` statement with no input handling, external dependencies, or dynamic behavior. The code is static and trivial.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- **Code correctness:** No issues; the code performs as described.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. All reports assign `malware: 0`.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; all reports assign `securityRisk: 0`.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate given the code. They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate, as the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justifications for Higher Scores**  \n- Since the code is trivial and static, there is no reason to assign higher scores.\n- The malware score remains 0; no suspicious activity is present.\n- The security risk remains 0; the code does not interact with any external systems or handle untrusted input.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No anomalies or assumptions are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Based on the provided reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**The code is entirely benign and poses no security concerns.**",
