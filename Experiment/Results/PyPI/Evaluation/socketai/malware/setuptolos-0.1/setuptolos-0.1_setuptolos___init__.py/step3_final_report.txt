  "purpose": "This code outputs a static message 'It Works' with no input handling, dependencies, or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is a simple print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no external dependencies, input handling, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring reflects the code's harmless nature.",
