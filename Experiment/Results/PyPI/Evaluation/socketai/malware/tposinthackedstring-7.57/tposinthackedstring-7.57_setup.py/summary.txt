  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell payloads during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression aligns with common malware techniques. While the exact payload is not decoded, the suspicious behavior warrants treating this package as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms its safety."
