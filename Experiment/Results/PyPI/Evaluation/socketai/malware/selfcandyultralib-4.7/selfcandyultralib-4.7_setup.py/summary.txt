  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, covert PowerShell execution during package setup. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.8) are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the package should be treated as potentially malicious and handled with caution."
