  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pypackagescraping'.",
  "sources": "Reads static strings for package metadata and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is standard setup script with no obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, sets static metadata variables, and calls 'setup()' with these values and other package configuration options. No external inputs, network calls, or executable code execution is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe and intended for legitimate package distribution.",
