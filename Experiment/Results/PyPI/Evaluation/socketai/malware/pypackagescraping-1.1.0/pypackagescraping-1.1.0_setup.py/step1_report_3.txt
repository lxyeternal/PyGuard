  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pypackagescraping' intended for scraping other Python packages.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; the code defines static variables and configuration for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; the setup function calls are standard package configuration calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive operations; the script solely configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets; the code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no inputs, no external data processing, and no suspicious logic or malicious behaviors present. The script performs a typical package configuration task without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
