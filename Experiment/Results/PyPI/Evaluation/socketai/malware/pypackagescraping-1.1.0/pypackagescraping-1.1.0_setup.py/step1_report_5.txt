  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pypackagescraping'.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, imported functions, and parameters within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets metadata for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines static package metadata variables, and calls setup() with these parameters. The code is straightforward, typical for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution or external data processing. No indications of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to serve the purpose of packaging the 'pypackagescraping' project without any signs of malware or malicious anomalies.",
