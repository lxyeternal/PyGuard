  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version, description, author info, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables, passed directly to setup() without dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that declares static package metadata and calls setup() with these values. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All signals indicate benign, typical packaging code. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and scores are appropriate and align with the code's simplicity and static nature.",
