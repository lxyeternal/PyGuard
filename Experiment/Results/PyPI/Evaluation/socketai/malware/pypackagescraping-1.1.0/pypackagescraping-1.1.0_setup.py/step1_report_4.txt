  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pypackagescraping'.",
  "sources": "Constants defined at the beginning (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; setup() parameters pass data to packaging tools, not handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Constants are assigned fixed string values and passed directly to setup(), with no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic execution or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines version and description constants, and calls setup() with static parameters. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs expected actions for packaging a Python project without external dependencies or data handling.",
