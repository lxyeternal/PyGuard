  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pypackagescraping'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables for version, description, and author details. It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external inputs. The setup function executes with static parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data. The setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines package metadata variables, and calls setup() with static arguments. It does not include any user input, environment variable usage, or network operations. The code appears to be a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a standard configuration file.",
