{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and steal sensitive user data including browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses, then upload the collected data to a remote server or cloud storage, potentially for malicious exploitation.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input and data from various local system files and directories such as browser data files, local State files, and memory; it also retrieves environment variables, system information, and clipboard contents.",
  "sinks": "The code posts data to external URLs (notably a specified webhook and transfer.sh), writes data to local files, and uploads stolen data (passwords, cookies, tokens) over network requests, effectively leaking sensitive information externally.",
  "flows": "Sources include local browser data files, environment variables, clipboard, and system info; data is decrypted, processed, and then sent via HTTP POST requests to remote servers; stolen credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info flow from sources to sinks through functions that extract, decrypt, and then upload or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, a list of process names for termination (likely anti-debugging or anti-analysis measures), obfuscation-like patterns in function names, attempts to disable certain protections, and extensive use of threading for parallel data collection. It also includes code that kills specific processes and modifies system files (like BetterDiscord files), which are typical of malicious activity. The script also attempts to hide its presence by deleting itself from startup paths.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info-stealer designed for malicious purposes. It collects browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system details, and clipboard data, decrypts sensitive data using system secrets, and uploads this information to external URLs. It attempts to disable debugging and anti-analysis tools, kills processes associated with security or analysis, and modifies or deletes system and application files to maintain persistence or prevent detection. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process termination routines, data exfiltration functions, and obfuscated patterns all point towards a malicious intent. The code's structure and behaviors align with typical malware or spyware operations aimed at data theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including data theft, system sabotage, and exfiltration of sensitive user information. It actively evades detection and analysis, terminates security processes, and transmits collected data to external servers. The intent appears to be to covertly harvest user credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and cryptocurrency addresses for malicious use, classifying it as malware with high security risk.",
