{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data theft and system information collection, including stealing browser credentials, cookies, tokens, screenshots, and system details, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks or uploads.",
  "sources": "User input/output functions (pyperclip.paste, clipboard content), environment variables (os.getenv), file reads (local state files, browser databases), network requests (requests, httpx, urlopen), process enumerations (psutil), and potentially malicious modules (subprocess).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs, file uploads (via requests.post), system commands (subprocess to kill processes), clipboard modifications (pyperclip.copy), and file system operations (creating, deleting, zipping files).",
  "flows": "Data from clipboard, environment variables, local browser and system data (credentials, cookies, tokens, history), flows into exfiltration functions via HTTP POST or file uploads; system information is collected and sent; process management functions kill specific processes; potentially malicious data is gathered from browsers and system files, then transmitted to attacker-controlled URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URLs, obfuscated regex patterns, extensive system and browser data extraction, process termination of security tools, modification of browser files (BetterDiscord), creation of zip archives of sensitive files, and automatic execution of data exfiltration routines without user consent. The code also attempts to disable protections and run at startup, indicating sabotage intent. Additionally, multiple threads run various data theft routines simultaneously.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive info-stealer designed for malicious purposes: it extracts credentials, cookies, tokens, browsing history, credit card info, and screenshots from browsers; it manipulates clipboard data to steal cryptocurrency addresses; it terminates security and debugging processes; it collects system info and geolocation; it creates zip archives of stolen data and uploads or sends via webhook. It also modifies browser files and manages persistence mechanisms. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, process-killing routines, and data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent. The code structure is complex, but the functions all contribute to data theft and sabotage, with no legitimate user-oriented functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware intended for unauthorized data collection, credential theft, system sabotage, and exfiltration. It actively targets browsers, system info, and user credentials, attempting to hide its activities and disable security tools. The overall risk is extremely high, and it should not be used or trusted.",
