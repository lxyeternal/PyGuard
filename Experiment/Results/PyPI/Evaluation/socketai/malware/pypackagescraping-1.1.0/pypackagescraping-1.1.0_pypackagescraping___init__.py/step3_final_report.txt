{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info stealer targeting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, clipboard data, and crypto addresses. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads, terminates security and debugging processes, manipulates browser files, and attempts persistence and evasion.",
  "sources": "Reads from browser Local State files, 'Login Data' databases, cookies, registry entries, environment variables, clipboard, and system commands. Also accesses local files, registry, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Posts data to external webhooks ('https://kekwltd.ru/relay'), uploads files to transfer.sh, and sends network requests with stolen data. Also modifies or deletes files for sabotage and persistence.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser files, registry, environment variables, clipboard, process list) feed into decryption routines, credential/token extraction, and data collection functions, which then transmit data via network requests or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs, extensive process termination routines targeting security/debugging tools, self-deletion from startup paths, manipulation of browser files, threading for parallel data collection, and some obfuscation patterns in variable names and code structure.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware: credential and token theft, system info exfiltration, process sabotage, persistence mechanisms, and active evasion techniques. It decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens from browser and registry data, kills security processes, modifies browser files, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads. The code's structure, routines, and behaviors align with malicious intent, with some obfuscation but no heavy encryption or code obfuscation. Its actions are consistent and deliberate, targeting data theft and system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious info stealer with active sabotage, data exfiltration, and evasion features. It warrants a malware score of 1, high security risk score of 1, and a low obfuscation score (~0.2). The behavior is consistent with active malware, and the scores reflect the severity accurately.",
