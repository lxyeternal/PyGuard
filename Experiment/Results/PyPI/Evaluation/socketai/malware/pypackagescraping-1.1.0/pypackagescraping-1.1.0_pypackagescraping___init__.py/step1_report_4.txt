{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting and exfiltrating sensitive user data such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and potentially wallet details, then uploading these to a remote server. It also includes malicious features like process killing, self-startup persistence, and file zipping for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'COMPUTERNAME', 'APPDATA', 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'TEMP'), local files (browser databases, cookies, history, passwords, wallet files), user clipboard data, and running processes. Network requests also read data from specified URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through POST requests to remote URLs (e.g., 'https://kekwltd.ru/relay') with sensitive data such as credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and files. File uploads are made via requests.post with files parameter. Also, system commands and process termination commands are used to manipulate system behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various sources such as browser databases, clipboard, process lists, and system commands to sinks like network POST requests and file uploads. Extracted tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are collected and then sent to the remote server. Data extraction functions gather information and then invoke upload functions that transmit data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include: attempting to kill common process names (discord, vboxservice, etc.), self-persistence mechanisms, obfuscated or redundant code sections, heavy use of threading for parallel data collection, and extensive data collection from browsers, system, and wallet files. The code also has hardcoded URLs, self-modifying functions, and checks for virtual machine indicators. Additionally, it actively manipulates clipboard data to steal crypto addresses, and obfuscates some functions, indicating attempts to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex and heavily obfuscated-like script targeting Windows OS. It leverages multiple methods to extract sensitive user data, including browser credential theft, cookies, history, wallet files, and system info. It collects Discord tokens and user info, stealing browser data and even Roblox cookies. It employs threading to perform concurrent operations, and uploads collected data via network requests to a remote server, likely for malicious purposes. It includes persistence techniques (startup copying), process termination for security bypass, and self-archiving (zipping and uploading). The presence of hardcoded URLs, obfuscated function names, and processes related to debuggers and VM checks strongly suggest malicious intent. The code’s overall structure and operations align with typical info-stealing malware or spyware tools designed for credential theft, privacy invasion, and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior intended for data theft, system reconnaissance, and exfiltration. It targets browser credentials, cookies, tokens, wallet addresses, and system info, then uploads these to an external server. It includes persistence mechanisms, process killing, and potential evasion techniques, indicating high malicious intent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should be considered unsafe for use.",
