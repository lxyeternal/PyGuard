{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious information stealer and malware payload, designed to extract browser data, system information, tokens, and credentials, and then exfiltrate the data via webhooks or file uploads. It also includes functionality for process termination, file zipping, and data collection from various sources.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, local files (browser databases, Local State, cookies, history, credit card info), clipboard data, running processes, and system information. It also retrieves tokens from Discord, Roblox, and other applications, and reads user input via the Windows registry and subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "The data is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to specified webhooks, file uploads to anonymous file hosting services, and through the transmission of sensitive tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info. Additionally, it kills security and debugging processes and modifies files and configurations for persistence and sabotage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, clipboard, environment variables, and system commands (sources) to sinks such as webhook POST requests, file uploads, and registry modifications. The flow includes decryption of stored credentials, collection of tokens, and exfiltration of sensitive data. Key source-to-sink paths involve reading browser files → decrypting data → sending via webhook or uploading files; token extraction → validation → exfiltration; process termination → sabotage.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded webhook URLs, hardcoded addresses for cryptocurrency, and an extensive list of process names to kill, indicating malicious intent. It bypasses system security checks, terminates security processes, and manipulates browser data. The code also contains obfuscated or misleading variable names, mixed code for data collection and exfiltration, and aggressive process control. The use of `os.system` and subprocess calls for registry and process management, along with attempts to disable debugging and virtual machine detection, are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive credential, token, cookies, and system info stealer targeting browsers, Discord, Roblox, and other applications. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API, extracts tokens from browser storage, and collects system and network info. It then exfiltrates this data to predefined webhook URLs or uploads files to anonymous hosting services. The code also kills security-related processes to hinder detection, modifies browser files, and creates persistence mechanisms via startup folder modifications. The presence of hardcoded addresses, extensive process termination, and data collection routines strongly indicates malicious behavior. Its structure, with multiple functions, threading, and obfuscation of variables, suggests intent to evade detection. The code’s primary purpose is to harvest sensitive data and exfiltrate it covertly, fitting typical malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits high malicious intent, acting as a credential, token, and data stealer targeting multiple applications and system info. It employs decryption routines, process termination, data exfiltration via webhooks, and file uploads. Its use of hardcoded URLs, process killers, and extensive data harvesting confirms it as malware designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. Overall, the code is highly malicious, dangerous, and should not be executed or used.",
