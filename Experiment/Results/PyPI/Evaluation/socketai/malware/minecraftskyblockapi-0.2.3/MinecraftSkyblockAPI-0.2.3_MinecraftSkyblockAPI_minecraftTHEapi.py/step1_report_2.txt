{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract tokens, saved passwords, cookies, and login data from various browsers and applications, decrypt sensitive information, and exfiltrate the collected data via webhook or Telegram.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), browser profile directories, leveldb files, local state files, login data, cookies, and log files.",
  "sinks": "Writing to local text files, executing system commands (copy, remove files), sending data over network via HTTP POST requests to Telegram and Discord webhooks.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser database files and environment variables, decrypted using cryptographic functions, stored temporarily in files, and then transmitted via network requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses and decrypts sensitive user data from multiple browsers, uses hardcoded webhook URLs, includes functions for extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and exfiltrates this data remotely. The code also writes logs and data files with predictable filenames based on user login. No user consent prompts or security checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code targets user data stored locally by browsers and applications, decrypts stored credentials using OS cryptographic functions, and extracts tokens potentially used for authentication. It then exfiltrates this sensitive data via network requests to specified webhooks. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, token placeholders, and automated data collection indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate user-facing functions and is focused solely on stealthy data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a credential stealer and data exfiltration tool, designed to harvest sensitive information from user browsers and applications without consent. It contains malicious behavior, including secret data collection, decryption of protected data, and remote transmission. The overall security risk is high, and it should be considered malicious malware.",
