{
  "purpose": "This code extracts and decrypts stored credentials, cookies, and tokens from various browsers and applications on the system, then uploads this sensitive data to remote servers via webhooks and Telegram.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA'), local browser and application data directories, local database files, and log/ldb files in browser directories.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Telegram and Discord webhooks, writing decrypted data and tokens to local text files, and reading local database files and credentials for extraction.",
  "flows": "Data is read from local system files (browser data, database files), decrypted using cryptographic functions, then sent via network requests to external URLs or saved locally. Sensitive data flows from local files to network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code to extract tokens and credentials from browsers and Discord, decryption routines for encrypted data, writing sensitive info to local files, and immediate uploading via webhooks suggest malicious data harvesting behavior. Use of hardcoded webhook URL, and presence of token placeholders indicate intentional exfiltration setup. No user interaction or consent mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables to locate browser and app data directories. It extracts tokens from LevelDB and log files using regex patterns, decrypts encrypted data using Windows cryptography APIs and cryptographic libraries, then decrypts stored passwords and cookies from browsers like Chrome, Brave, and Edge. It writes all obtained credentials, cookies, and tokens into local text files, and then exfiltrates these files via Telegram and Discord webhooks. The code appears designed to stealthily harvest user credentials, tokens, and cookies, and to send this data to remote servers without user consent. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and token placeholders suggest intended malicious use rather than benign data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential and token stealer, extracting sensitive user data from browsers and applications, decrypting it, and exfiltrating it through webhooks and messaging services. The behavior aligns with typical malware designed for credential theft, with no legitimate or benign purpose apparent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is also high.",
