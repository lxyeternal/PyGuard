  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using setuptools, serving as a static setup configuration.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package list and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static parameters, no dynamic code, network calls, or data handling. Dependencies are common packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and dependency list do not indicate any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
