  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the MinecraftSkyblockAPI Python module.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no code execution, network communication, or data handling beyond dependency declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the setup is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging, specifying package name, version, description, included packages, and dependencies. The dependencies listed ('requests', 'pycryptodomex', 'pywin32') are common packages, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling. The script appears to be straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior detected. No indicators of supply chain attack or malware are present.",
