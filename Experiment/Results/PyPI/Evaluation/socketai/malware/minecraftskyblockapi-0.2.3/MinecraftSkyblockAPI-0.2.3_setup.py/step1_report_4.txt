  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The dependencies listed are common libraries; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to specify package information and required dependencies. No code execution, user input handling, or network activities are present. All dependencies are common Python libraries without signs of malicious intent. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
