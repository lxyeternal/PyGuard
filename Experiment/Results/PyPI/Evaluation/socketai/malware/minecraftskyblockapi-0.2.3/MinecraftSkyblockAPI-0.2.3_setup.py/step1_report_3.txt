{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'MinecraftSkyblockAPI' Python project, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "User-provided setup configuration; no external input reading or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as executing untrusted data, network connections, or file modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script purely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The listed dependencies are common Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package info and requirements. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behavior. The dependencies 'requests', 'pycryptodomex', and 'pywin32' are standard for network requests, cryptography, and Windows-specific operations respectively. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
