  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'MinecraftSkyblockAPI' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, description, packages, dependencies) from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "N/A - this is a static configuration file, not dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. All dependencies are common Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata, including dependencies such as 'requests', 'pycryptodomex', and 'pywin32'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The dependencies are standard for a package that may involve web requests, cryptography, and Windows-specific features. The file strictly provides package configuration info without executing any untrusted code or handling input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided content.",
