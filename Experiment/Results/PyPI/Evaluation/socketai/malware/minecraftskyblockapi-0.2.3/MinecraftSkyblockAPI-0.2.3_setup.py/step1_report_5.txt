  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the MinecraftSkyblockAPI Python package.",
  "sources": "Static values in setup() call, including package name, version, description, package list, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static setup configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure with common dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to specify package details and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious or obfuscated code present. Dependencies listed are standard packages: requests, pycryptodomex, and pywin32, which are commonly used libraries. No hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code components.",
