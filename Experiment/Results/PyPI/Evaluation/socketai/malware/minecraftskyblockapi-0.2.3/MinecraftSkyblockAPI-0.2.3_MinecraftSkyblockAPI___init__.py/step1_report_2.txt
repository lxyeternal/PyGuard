  "purpose": "Initialize the MinecraftSkyblockAPI package by importing all contents from the minecraftTHEapi module and exposing it as part of the package's public API.",
  "sources": "The import statement: 'from .minecraftTHEapi import *'",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code only imports and exposes a module.",
  "flows": "Importing all from minecraftTHEapi (source) makes the module's functions/classes available for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which specific functions or classes are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as an initializer that imports all symbols from a local module. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No external data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious code logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports content from a module. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but does not imply malicious behavior in itself.",
