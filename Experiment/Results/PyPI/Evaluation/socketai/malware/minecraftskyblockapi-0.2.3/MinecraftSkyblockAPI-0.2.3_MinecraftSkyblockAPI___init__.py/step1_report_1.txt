  "purpose": "This module initializes the MinecraftSkyblockAPI package by importing everything from the minecraftTHEapi module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .minecraftTHEapi import *",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious or unwanted code, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a standard package initialization by importing all contents from another module. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but does not itself introduce malicious behavior. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, code execution, or network activity. Without inspecting the imported module, no malicious activity can be determined solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package init file with minimal logic. The use of wildcard import warrants caution, but there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
