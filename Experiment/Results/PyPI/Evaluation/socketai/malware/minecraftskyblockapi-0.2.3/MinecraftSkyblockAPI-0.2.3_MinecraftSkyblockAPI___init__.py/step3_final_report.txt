  "purpose": "Package initialization that imports all symbols from the local module 'minecraftTHEapi' and exposes 'minecraftTHEapi' via __all__.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .minecraftTHEapi import *' reads all symbols from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Symbols imported via '*' are made available in the namespace and exposed through __all__, but no data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure namespace and potentially hide malicious symbols if the imported module is compromised; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initializer importing everything from a local module and exposing it. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which is stylistically discouraged but not inherently malicious. The imported module's content is unknown, so malicious activity cannot be confirmed, but the code snippet itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1) due to the wildcard import. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main issue is the use of 'import *', which could be improved for clarity but does not constitute a security threat. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
