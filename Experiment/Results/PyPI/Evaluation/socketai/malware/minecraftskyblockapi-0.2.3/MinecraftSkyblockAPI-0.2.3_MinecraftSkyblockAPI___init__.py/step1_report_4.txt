  "purpose": "To initialize the MinecraftSkyblockAPI package by importing all contents from the minecraftTHEapi module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .minecraftTHEapi import *",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads all symbols from minecraftTHEapi; no data flows are visible beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can be considered risky or unconventional, but in this context it appears to be a simple package setup without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the package's namespace by importing all symbols from a submodule and defining __all__ for export. No data processing, input/output handling, or external connections are evident. The wildcard import could potentially hide malicious or unwanted code if the submodule contained any, but based solely on this file, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with minimal logic. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident in this code snippet. The use of wildcard import warrants caution in larger contexts but does not imply malicious intent here.",
