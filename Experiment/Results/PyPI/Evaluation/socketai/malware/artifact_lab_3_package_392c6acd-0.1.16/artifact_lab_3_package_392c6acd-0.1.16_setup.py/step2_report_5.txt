  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No untrusted input, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is reported.\n- The code reads a README.md file securely with specified encoding.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The package dependencies are empty, and the setup process is straightforward.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Code correctness:** The code is correct and follows standard practices.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the script is benign.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- No issues are identified that warrant raising the risk score above 0.5.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, consistent with the reports.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence provided and the standard nature of the script.",
