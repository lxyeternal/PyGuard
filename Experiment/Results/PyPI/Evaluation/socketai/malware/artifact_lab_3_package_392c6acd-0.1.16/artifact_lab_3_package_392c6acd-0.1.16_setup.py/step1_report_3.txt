  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file, then passing parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward and standard for packaging",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary functions from setuptools, reads a README.md file to include as the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The dependencies list is empty, and no potentially malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
