  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static data passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or code execution",
  "flows": "Reading static file -> passing content to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README.md file with specified encoding, and calls setup() with package info. No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code follows standard practices without obfuscation or secrets. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
