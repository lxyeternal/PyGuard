{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, specifying metadata, package discovery, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network communication, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted input to critical functions or sensitive data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script structure, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file for long description, and configures package metadata and dependencies. It uses find_packages() to discover packages automatically. There is no code that accepts user input, accesses environment variables, or interacts with external systems. All operations are standard for package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Python setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
