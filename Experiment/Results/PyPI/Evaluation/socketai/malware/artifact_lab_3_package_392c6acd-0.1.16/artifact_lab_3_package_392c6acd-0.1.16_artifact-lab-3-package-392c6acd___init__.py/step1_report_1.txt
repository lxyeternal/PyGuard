{
  "purpose": "This module imports the 'reverse_shell' function or object from the 'main' submodule, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main import reverse_shell",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no direct data sinks or network operations in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import statement is straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern if 'reverse_shell' is used maliciously, but no such code or behavior is present here",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file importing 'reverse_shell' from a local module. Without additional context, 'reverse_shell' could be potentially malicious if it implements reverse shell behavior. However, this file itself does not contain any executable code beyond the import statement. The presence of such an import warrants further investigation into the 'main' module to assess the nature of 'reverse_shell'.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, it is a benign import statement. No malicious behavior is evident here. Further review of the 'main' module is recommended to evaluate the potential risk of 'reverse_shell'.",
