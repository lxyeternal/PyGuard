  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'data.txt', environment variables, user input, and possibly network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, file I/O, or network connections; no explicit malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment) to sinks (files, network), but no suspicious or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; minimal or missing code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the descriptions. Risk scores are mostly 0.2, reflecting cautious handling of environment variables or data processing, but no evidence of vulnerabilities. Confidence levels are high where code is present and clear, lower where code is missing or incomplete. The assessments are internally consistent and appropriate given the information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed are benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The risk scores are slightly conservative but reasonable. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the provided reports.",
