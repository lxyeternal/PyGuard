  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'requests-toolbeltt'.",
  "sources": "Complex obfuscated conditional checks, dynamic imports, environment variable retrieval, file system operations, network operations, and potentially malicious object creation or execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of system commands, creation of shortcuts, file manipulation, network communication, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated conditions determine whether to import modules or execute system/network operations, often depending on convoluted calculations. Data from environment variables and filesystem is accessed or used to control execution flow, potentially leading to malicious activities such as file creation, system modification, or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using large bitwise operations, dynamic attribute access via 'getattr' with convoluted expressions, unpredictable control flow, use of obscure variable names, and nested complex calculations that do not serve a clear purpose. Presence of code that creates shortcuts, modifies files, makes directories, and interacts with system components suspiciously, especially given the random control flags and obscure calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with convoluted logic involving dynamic attribute retrieval from built-in functions like 'oct', 'hex', and 'copyright', obscuring its intent. Multiple conditional blocks depend on complex, calculated integer values, often using bitwise and shift operations. The code includes imports of modules such as 'pip', 'os', 'ctypes', and 'win32com', often under obfuscated control flow, and performs actions like creating shortcuts, manipulating files and directories, and calling system APIs. Some branches involve environment variable access, file existence checks, and filesystem modifications. There is evidence of potentially malicious behavior: creation of shortcuts, executing system calls, and reading/writing files or registry-like entries. The use of dynamically generated strings for module names and functions, combined with encrypted or obfuscated logic, indicates an intent to hide malicious actions. The code appears designed to run depending on specific conditions that are intentionally obscured, making detection difficult and potentially malicious activities more likely.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple suspicious behaviors, including dynamic imports, system modifications, file and directory operations, and network interactions. These behaviors, combined with the convoluted logic and obfuscated control flow, strongly suggest malicious intent. The purpose appears to be hiding or executing harmful activities under the guise of a package setup script. Therefore, this dependency should be considered malicious or at high risk for sabotage and not be trusted.",
