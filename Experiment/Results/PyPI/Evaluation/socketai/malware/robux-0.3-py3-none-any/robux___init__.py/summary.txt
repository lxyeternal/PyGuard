  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing credential theft, decryption, and data exfiltration. The high malware score (1.0) and security risk score (1.0) are justified. Obfuscation is minimal, with a score around 0.2. The overall threat level is extremely high, and the code should be considered malicious and dangerous."
