{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed to extract sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and hardware IDs, then send this data to an external server.",
  "sources": "Input data is collected from browser local storage files, cookies, environment variables, and system commands (e.g., wmic for hardware ID).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data, such as tokens and cookies, are sent via HTTP POST request to an external server. Functions involve potentially decrypting stored credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local browser storage and environment variables into collected token and cookie variables, which are then sent to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code installs multiple Python packages automatically, many of which are not used elsewhere in the code. It attempts to decrypt stored credentials and cookies from multiple browsers. It sends potentially stolen data externally. The repeated installation of 'datetime' and other modules is suspicious and inefficient.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by attempting to import various modules, installing them if missing, which indicates a setup for malicious activity. It defines functions to decrypt data and retrieve hardware ID, as well as functions to extract Discord tokens from local storage and cookies from multiple browsers. The token extraction involves reading browser data files, decrypting stored encrypted tokens, and verifying their validity by API requests. The Roblox cookie retrieval scans browser cookies for '.ROBLOSECURITY' tokens. Finally, it collects the Discord token and Roblox cookie and POSTs this sensitive data to an external server, indicating exfiltration of user credentials. The extensive use of environment variables, system commands, and external requests confirms malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to extract user credentials and hardware identifiers, then exfiltrate this data to an external server. It contains suspicious behaviors such as automatic package installation, credential decryption, and external data exfiltration, indicative of malicious intent and user privacy violation.",
