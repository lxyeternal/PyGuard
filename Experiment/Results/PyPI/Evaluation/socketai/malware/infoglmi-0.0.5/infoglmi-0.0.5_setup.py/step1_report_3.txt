  "purpose": "Download a file and write configuration data, then execute a script from /tmp.",
  "sources": "requests.get to fetch remote content; open() calls for writing files (/tmp/node and /tmp/config.json).",
  "sinks": "system() call executing /tmp/node after making it executable.",
  "flows": "requests.get() -> writing to /tmp/node -> system(\"cd /tmp && chmod +x node && ./node\")",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a binary from an external URL, writing a JSON config with specific pool details, executing a downloaded file, lack of validation or verification, hardcoded URL and IP address, minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports requests and system modules, fetches a file from a suspicious URL and writes it to /tmp/node, writes a configuration JSON with specific pool settings, and then executes the downloaded binary. The content and behavior suggest potentially malicious intent, especially considering the remote download, execution of external code, and configuration that appears related to mining pools. No input validation or verification of the fetched binary is performed. The code runs the downloaded binary without checks, which could be malicious. The setup section is standard packaging code with no malicious activity. The core concern is the remote fetch, execution, and configuration file creation, indicating malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code from a suspicious URL, combined with writing a configuration that appears related to mining pools. These actions are typical in supply chain attacks or malware deployment. The overall security risk is high, and this package should not be used.",
