  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity is present.\n- The dependencies listed are common, though some (e.g., 'discordwebhook', 'browser_cookie3', 'robloxpy') could be misused if the package contained malicious code, but the script itself does not include such code.\n- Author fields are empty, which is unusual but not suspicious per se.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the reports; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The dependencies are listed but their trustworthiness cannot be determined solely from this script.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- They assign low security risk scores, which is appropriate.\n- The only potential concern is the use of dependencies that could be malicious if misused, but the script itself does not contain malicious logic.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal concern about missing author info or dependency trustworthiness, which is reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and reasoning.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriately cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — reasonable given the minimal metadata and dependency list.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The dependencies are common but should be verified separately for trustworthiness.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal metadata concerns)\n\n**Note:** The potential for malicious activity lies in how the package is used or if the dependencies are compromised, but the setup script itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No further action needed based on this snippet.",
