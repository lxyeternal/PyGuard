{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools', defines version, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no runtime data processing, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; dependencies are common but could be misused if malicious code exists elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. The dependencies listed are standard packages; their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The empty author fields are unusual but not suspicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to missing metadata and dependencies, but no active threats are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
