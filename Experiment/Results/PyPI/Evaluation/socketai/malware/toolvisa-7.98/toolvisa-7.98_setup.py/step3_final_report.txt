  "purpose": "Setup script that conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently during installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions; silent process creation hides activity.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, runs encoded PowerShell command silently -> setup proceeds or fails silently.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed with hidden window and suppressed errors; no decoding or validation of command.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently if the directory is missing. The command is encoded, likely obfuscated, and run with no window and error suppression, which are common tactics to conceal malicious activity. The setup process is wrapped in try-except blocks that silently ignore errors, further hiding potential issues. The pattern suggests an attempt to execute hidden, potentially malicious payloads during installation, consistent with supply chain sabotage or malware deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The silent error handling and obfuscation strongly suggest concealment of malicious payloads. Given these indicators, the package should be considered malicious or compromised, posing a high security risk.",
