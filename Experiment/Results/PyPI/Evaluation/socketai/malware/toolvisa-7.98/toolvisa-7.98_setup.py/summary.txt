  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The silent error handling and obfuscation strongly suggest concealment of malicious payloads. Given these indicators, the package should be considered malicious or compromised, posing a high security risk."
