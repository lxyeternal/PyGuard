  "purpose": "Parse and handle XML error responses from the COS service, encapsulating error details into custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "xml.dom.minidom.parseString(data) parsing XML string; getElementsByTagName calls extracting specific tags.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input XML data -> parseString -> extract error info -> encapsulate in exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "Exception handling in digest_xml returns a string message instead of raising an exception, which could hide parsing errors but does not pose a security threat.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward XML parser for error responses, with custom exception classes. It uses standard library functions without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No network calls or code injection points are present. Error handling is minimal but safe. The code processes untrusted XML input, which introduces a minor security concern, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard XML error parser with no malicious intent. It handles untrusted input cautiously, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be slightly above zero (around 0.1) to reflect the processing of untrusted data, but overall the risk is minimal.",
