  "purpose": "Parse and handle XML-based error messages from a COS (Cloud Object Storage) service, encapsulating errors into custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "xml.dom.minidom.parseString(data): reads XML data input for parsing.",
  "sinks": "None directly, no untrusted data output or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "XML data input is parsed into a DOM tree, and specific elements' node values are extracted into a dictionary. Errors during parsing are caught and a string message is returned.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears to perform straightforward XML parsing and exception handling without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for handling COS errors. The digest_xml function parses XML error responses to extract specific fields such as code, message, resource, requestid, and traceid. Error handling is minimal, catching all exceptions and returning a generic error message. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No network operations, credential handling, or external resource access are present. The structure and logic are standard for error processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely for parsing XML error messages and encapsulating them into custom exceptions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
