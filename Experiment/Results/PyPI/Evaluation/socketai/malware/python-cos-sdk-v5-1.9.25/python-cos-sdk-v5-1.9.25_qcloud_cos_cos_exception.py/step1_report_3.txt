{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and handle XML error responses from a COS (Cloud Object Storage) service, encapsulating errors in custom exceptions and extracting relevant information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a string input to parse XML content, specifically from the 'data' parameter in 'digest_xml' function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output data to external systems or files; it only processes input data internally and raises exceptions with parsed error info.",
  "flows": "Input data is parsed via 'xml.dom.minidom.parseString', then specific XML tags are accessed to form a dictionary, which is used in exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The code relies solely on standard XML parsing and exception handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions and a function to parse XML error messages. It uses standard library functions for XML parsing without any suspicious or malicious constructs. Error handling appears straightforward. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The parsing logic is simple and does not involve any untrusted code execution or unsafe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for XML error response parsing with custom exception classes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats. The design appears safe, focusing on error handling for a cloud storage client.",
