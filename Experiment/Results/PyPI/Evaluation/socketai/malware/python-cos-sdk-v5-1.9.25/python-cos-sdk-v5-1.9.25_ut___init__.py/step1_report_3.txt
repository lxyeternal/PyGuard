  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard package initialization and may include some utility functions, but no clear purpose is explicitly defined.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, or external network calls (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network sockets, file writes, or subprocess calls that could execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network connections or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard import statements and function definitions. No suspicious network activity, credential storage, or code injection mechanisms are identified. The absence of external network calls, obfuscated code, or unusual system modifications suggests typical package behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The structure indicates routine utility functions, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not display signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to be a benign package with standard functions and no suspicious operations detected.",
