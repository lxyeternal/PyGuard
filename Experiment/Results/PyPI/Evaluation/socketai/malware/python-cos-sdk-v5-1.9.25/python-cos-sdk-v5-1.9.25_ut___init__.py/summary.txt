  "conclusion": "The code snippets with eval and dynamic imports exhibit moderate obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, warranting cautious scores of approximately 0.5 for malware and 0.6 for obfuscation, with a security risk around 0.6. Benign snippets are correctly scored with zero. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets to confirm malicious intent."
