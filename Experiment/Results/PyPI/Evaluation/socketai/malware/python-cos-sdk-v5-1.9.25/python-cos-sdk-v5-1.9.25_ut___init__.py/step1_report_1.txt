  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a template or a placeholder for code review instructions rather than functional code.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources are identified in the code; it contains only comment and instruction text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no potential data leak points or untrusted data handling are visible.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code does not perform any data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The entire content consists of instruction comments without actual executable code, which is unusual for a code file intended for runtime execution; this may suggest the code is a template or improperly formatted.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely composed of descriptive comments outlining the review process, security considerations, and scoring criteria for malware and security risks. There are no functional or executable components, no data processing, no use of third-party libraries, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The absence of operational code indicates this is not an actual code snippet but a set of instructions or documentation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present within this content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided content does not contain executable code or any malicious elements. It appears to be an instruction set or documentation rather than a code sample. Therefore, there is no evidence of malware or security threats in this input.",
