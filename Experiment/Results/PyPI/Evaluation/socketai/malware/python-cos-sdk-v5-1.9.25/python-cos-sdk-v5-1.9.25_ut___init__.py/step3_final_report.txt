  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval, environment variables, network requests, file I/O, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variables, file system, eval execution, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, input data) to eval, dynamic imports, network sinks, file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, dynamic imports, obfuscated code elements, reading environment variables for sensitive data, incomplete snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code contains suspicious constructs such as eval and dynamic imports, which are common indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent. Benign code snippets lack these features and are correctly scored with zero malware and obfuscation. The presence of eval and dynamic imports in some snippets justifies higher scores for obfuscation (0.6) and malware (0.5), reflecting moderate suspicion. Incomplete or purely documentation snippets are appropriately scored with zero. The overall flow suggests potential for malicious activity, but no confirmed malicious payloads are identified. The scores are consistent with the signals observed, and the confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets with eval and dynamic imports exhibit moderate obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, warranting cautious scores of approximately 0.5 for malware and 0.6 for obfuscation, with a security risk around 0.6. Benign snippets are correctly scored with zero. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious snippets to confirm malicious intent.",
