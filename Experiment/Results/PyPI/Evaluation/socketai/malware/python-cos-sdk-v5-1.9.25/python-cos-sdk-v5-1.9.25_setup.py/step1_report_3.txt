  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'python-cos-sdk-v5', responsible for defining package metadata, dependencies, and reading long description from a README file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'README.rst' files, accessing package metadata, and Python version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input data; primarily reads local files and defines package info.",
  "flows": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'README.rst' files to gather dependencies and description, then passes this info to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns detected. No network activity or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing only necessary modules, reading local files for dependencies and descriptions, and defining package metadata. It adjusts dependencies based on Python version. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected.",
