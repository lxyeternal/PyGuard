  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, primarily reading static files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.rst') and setting package metadata.\n- No dynamic or user input, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior are present.\n- The logic for dependency version constraints based on Python version is typical and benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk and malware score of 0, which seems appropriate.\n- The confidence level is high (1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No anomalies, suspicious flows, or anomalies are detected.\n\n**Potential issues or overlooked points:**\n\n- The only minor point is that the script reads 'requirements.txt' and 'README.rst' files without verifying their integrity or authenticity, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code or perform any network activity.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors such as malicious dependencies or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
