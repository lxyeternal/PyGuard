  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup script, which reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', long description from 'README.rst', and sets package metadata.\n- The code performs version checks to adjust dependencies, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input appears to influence the execution beyond reading local files.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code's purpose is solely package setup, with no network activity, data leaks, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** The code matches the descriptions; no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **None.** The code appears well-structured and standard for a setup script.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify the script as a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or exploits; the analysis is appropriate.\n- The dependency version checks are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious patterns, I agree with the reports' assessments. There are no hidden backdoors, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                                      |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious activity, network calls, or payloads present.        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                  |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.   |\n\nThis setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no security concerns.",
