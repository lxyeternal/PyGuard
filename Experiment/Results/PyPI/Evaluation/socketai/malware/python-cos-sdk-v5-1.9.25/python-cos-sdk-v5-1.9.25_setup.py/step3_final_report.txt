{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and description from 'README.rst', setting package metadata and dependencies based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, reads 'README.rst' for long description, uses static strings for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, dynamic code execution, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and version checks influence package requirements; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script following standard practices. It reads local files for dependencies and description, performs version-dependent dependency constraints, and calls 'setup()' with static metadata. No dynamic or untrusted data influences execution, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The dependency version checks are typical and do not introduce security issues. The code's purpose is solely package configuration, with no network activity or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk. All reports correctly identify it as a non-malicious setup script with no obfuscation or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
