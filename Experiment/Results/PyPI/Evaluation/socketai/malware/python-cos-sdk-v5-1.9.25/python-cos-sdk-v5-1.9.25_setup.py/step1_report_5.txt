  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'python-cos-sdk-v5', configuring dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.rst' for long description, accessing system version info, and package setup functions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements and description files influence package installation metadata; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; the code is standard for a setup script with version-dependent requirements.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup configurations for a Python package, reading dependency requirements from a file and setting package metadata. It adjusts dependencies based on Python version, which is standard practice. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for package configuration purposes.",
