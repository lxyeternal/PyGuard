  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No report detects any malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code reads static files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.rst') and uses standard setup procedures.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code adjusts dependencies based on Python version, which is a common practice.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it reads dependencies, long description, and defines package metadata.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or flow.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on benignity, and the code is straightforward, there's no evidence to suggest malicious intent.\n- The only possible point of concern could be the 'requirements.txt' file or the actual contents of the files, but these are outside the scope of the provided code and reports.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The overall security risk score should be **0**.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The detailed reasoning in each report is accurate and aligns with the code.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary based on the current evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
