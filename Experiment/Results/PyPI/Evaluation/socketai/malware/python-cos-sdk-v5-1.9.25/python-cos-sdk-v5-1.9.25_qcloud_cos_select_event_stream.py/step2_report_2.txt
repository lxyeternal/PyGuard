  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard streaming parser handling binary data, headers, payloads, and file output.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on external modules (`cos_comm`, `cos_exception`) and standard Python functions.\n- Error handling is via exceptions and logging, with no network activity beyond reading from the stream.\n- File handling uses temporary files and renaming, a common safe practice.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- The code reads binary data from `self._raw`, which is derived from `self._rt.raw`. This is consistent with streaming data sources.\n- Payloads are written to files or returned as bytes, with no direct network transmission or suspicious data handling.\n- Error messages are logged and raise exceptions, which is standard.\n- No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n| Aspect             | Reported Score | Reasoning / Recommendations                                              |\n|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | 0              | No malware or malicious activity detected. The code is a parser.        |\n| **Obfuscated**    | 0              | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.                         |\n| **Risk**          | 0.2            | Slightly above zero due to file handling and stream parsing, but overall minimal risk. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity. |\n\n**Note:** Since the code does not perform any network transmission of data beyond reading, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious logic, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**These scores reflect a benign, standard implementation of a streaming event parser with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a legitimate, standard streaming parser with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a very low risk score (~0.2), considering the file handling and parsing logic, but overall, the security posture is minimal risk.",
