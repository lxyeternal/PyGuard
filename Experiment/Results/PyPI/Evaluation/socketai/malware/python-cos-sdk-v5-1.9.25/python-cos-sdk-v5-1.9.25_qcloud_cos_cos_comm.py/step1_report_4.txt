  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling data encoding, hashing, XML processing, URL formatting, and object management in a cloud storage SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines constants, and processes input data such as files, strings, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions, URL generation, XML parsing, data encoding, and header mapping functions that could handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data is fetched from various sources (parameters, files, streams), processed through encoding/hashing functions, formatted into XML or URLs, and outputted or used in network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors detected. Use of eval in 'xml_to_dict' is a potential risk, but in this context, it only evals a controlled string derived from a replaced XML string, reducing suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions for data encoding, hashing, XML handling, and URL formatting common in cloud SDKs. It safely handles file-like objects, strings, and dictionaries, with checks for input validity. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The use of 'eval' in 'xml_to_dict' warrants caution, but it's used on a sanitized string, minimizing risk. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate SDK purposes with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for cloud storage operations with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It includes safe data processing and formatting routines typical of a cloud SDK, with a minor note on 'eval' usage that appears controlled. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
