  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, hashing, XML processing, URL formatting, ACL parsing, and progress tracking within a cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, file-like objects, environment variables, and external XML strings.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to hashing functions, XML generation, URL construction, and headers for HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding and hashing functions, XML conversions, and URL formatting functions, with no evidence of malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' in 'xml_to_dict' function, which could pose security risks if processing untrusted XML input.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for a cloud SDK, with clear structure and no suspicious activities. The only potential concern is the use of 'eval' in 'xml_to_dict', which is controlled through string replacements but could be unsafe if input XML is malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is appropriately low (0), and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of 'eval' usage. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility module for cloud storage operations. No malware or sabotage detected. The minor security concern regarding 'eval' can be mitigated by replacing it with a safer XML parsing method, but as is, it does not constitute malicious activity.",
