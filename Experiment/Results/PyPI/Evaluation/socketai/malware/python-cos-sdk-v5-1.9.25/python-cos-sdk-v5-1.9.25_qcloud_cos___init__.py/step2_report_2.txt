  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code only performs straightforward imports and sets up a NullHandler for logging. No data flows, no processing, no external inputs or outputs. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no suspicious activity. Risk score 0 is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is just importing modules and configuring logging. No suspicious data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, seems accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard import and logging setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports and logging configuration. No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Imports classes and functions related to cloud storage, with no data processing or network activity. The use of a fallback NullHandler is standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0, aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assigned 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All 0, as the code is benign, performs only imports and logging setup.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a standard, benign module setup for a cloud SDK.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
