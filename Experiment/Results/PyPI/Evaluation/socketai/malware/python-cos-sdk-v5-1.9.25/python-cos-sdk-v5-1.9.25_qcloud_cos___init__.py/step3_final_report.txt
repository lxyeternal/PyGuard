  "purpose": "Import modules related to cloud storage SDK components and set up logging with a fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Local module imports and the standard logging library",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; only internal module setup",
  "flows": "None; the code performs static imports and configuration without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statements and logging setup, including fallback class",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup snippet for a Python SDK, importing necessary components and configuring logging with a NullHandler fallback. It contains no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The fallback NullHandler class is a common pattern for compatibility. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as an initialization module indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a cloud SDK with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identified its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
