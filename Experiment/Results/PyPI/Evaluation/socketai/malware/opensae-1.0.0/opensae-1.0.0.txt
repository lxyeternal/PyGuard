      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including decrypting and executing an embedded payload during installation on Windows. The pattern aligns with supply chain malware or backdoor tactics. The embedded encrypted payload, hardcoded cryptographic key, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and should not be used or distributed until further analysis is conducted."
