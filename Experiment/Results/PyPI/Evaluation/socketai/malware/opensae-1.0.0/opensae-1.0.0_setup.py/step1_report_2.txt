  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'opensae' Python package, including custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "User input via setup arguments and potentially malicious code executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code within the custom install class; import of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, import 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypt and execute code via Fernet.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec' with a Fernet-encrypted string is suspicious. The encrypted payload may be malicious. The code is designed to run only on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation command that, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it dynamically using 'exec'. The encrypted payload is unknown, but executing decrypted code at install time is highly suspicious, as it may be malicious or compromise the system. The use of Fernet encryption suggests an attempt to conceal malicious code. The package also declares dependencies ('fernet', 'requests') but their usage appears to be tied to executing remote or hidden code. No other malicious patterns like hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident outside this dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious dynamic execution of decrypted code during installation on Windows platforms, which is a common technique used in malicious supply chain attacks. This behavior indicates a significant security risk and potential malware. The package could execute arbitrary code, possibly malicious, at install time.",
