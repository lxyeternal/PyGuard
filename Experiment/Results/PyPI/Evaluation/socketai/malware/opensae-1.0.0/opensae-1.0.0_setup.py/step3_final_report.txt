  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the setup script, focusing on embedded encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation on Windows.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded encrypted string, hardcoded Fernet key, conditional check for Windows OS, import of requests and fernet modules.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potential for arbitrary code execution during package installation.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts the embedded payload with a hardcoded key, then executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload embedded directly in code, decryption key hardcoded, code executes during install without validation, conditional on Windows platform.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom install class that, on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes the resulting code via exec(). This pattern is highly suspicious, as it indicates an embedded payload that is concealed and dynamically executed during installation, a common tactic in malicious backdoors or supply chain attacks. The presence of encrypted data, hardcoded cryptographic keys, and runtime code execution without validation are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code's behavior is consistent with known malicious patterns, and the use of conditional execution on Windows suggests targeted malicious activity. The embedded encrypted payload and obfuscated strings further support this assessment. Given these factors, the behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious activity, including decrypting and executing an embedded payload during installation on Windows. The pattern aligns with supply chain malware or backdoor tactics. The embedded encrypted payload, hardcoded cryptographic key, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious and should not be used or distributed until further analysis is conducted.",
