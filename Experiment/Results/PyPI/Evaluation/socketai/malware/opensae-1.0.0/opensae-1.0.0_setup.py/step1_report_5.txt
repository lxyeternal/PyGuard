{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with a custom install command that executes decrypted code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'exec' call which decrypts and executes embedded code; environment detection via 'os.name'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes code decrypted from a Fernet key, which can run arbitrary code, representing a critical sink.",
  "flows": "The code reads environment info ('os.name') and then decrypts and executes hidden code if on Windows, forming a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload within the code, conditional execution based on OS, use of 'exec' on decrypted content, and a cryptographic key embedded in code are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install class that overrides the 'run' method. On Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' for cryptography. It then decrypts an encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. The encrypted data and key are embedded directly in the source, and the code only runs this malicious payload if on Windows. The use of encrypted payloads, conditional execution, and 'exec' on decrypted data strongly suggest malicious intent, as this pattern is often used for hidden backdoors or malicious post-install behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that decrypts and executes arbitrary code on Windows systems during package installation. This is indicative of malicious behavior designed to compromise the target system post-installation.",
