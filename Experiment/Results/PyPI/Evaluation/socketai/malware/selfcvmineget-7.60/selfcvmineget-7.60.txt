      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The suspicious domain and obfuscation support this assessment. While the setup code appears benign, the embedded payload warrants suspicion and further analysis. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at approximately 0.85."
