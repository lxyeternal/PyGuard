  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, warranting a high malware and security risk score. While the exact payload is unknown, the obfuscation and stealth tactics justify treating this package as potentially malicious and requiring further analysis."
