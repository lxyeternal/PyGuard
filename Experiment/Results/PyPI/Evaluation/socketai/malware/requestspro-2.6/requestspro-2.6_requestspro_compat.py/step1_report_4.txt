{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3 in the requestspro.compat module.",
  "sources": "Untrusted data could potentially originate from external modules or environment variables, but in this code, data sources are limited to imports and sys info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include imports, variable assignments, and redefinitions, but none directly involve untrusted input handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Code reads system info and attempts to import modules, then sets up compatibility variables. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard compatibility boilerplate without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, Python version detection, and compatibility definitions. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The use of try-except for optional modules is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward compatibility boilerplate with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment detection and module setup in a standard, safe manner.",
