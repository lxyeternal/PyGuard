{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, including imports and version-specific adjustments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'chardet', 'simplejson', 'sys', 'collections', 'http', 'io', and 'urllib', which are used to gather data and handle HTTP and URL operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or evaluate untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs imports and assigns compatibility flags; there are no data flows from sources to sinks that involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. The code contains standard compatibility handling, conditional imports, and version checks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python compatibility setup, including fallback imports and version detection. It uses try-except blocks to conditionally import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' and 'simplejson' or 'json'. It defines version flags and compatibility variables. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present. The code's structure and operations are typical for compatibility modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign compatibility support module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is solely to maintain cross-version compatibility, and it does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
