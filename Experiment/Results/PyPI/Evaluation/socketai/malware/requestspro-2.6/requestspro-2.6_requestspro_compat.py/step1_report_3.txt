{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and import handling for different Python versions and modules, mainly to ensure backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information from sys.version_info, attempts to import optional modules like chardet, simplejson, and standard libraries such as collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input or output data. No untrusted data handling or external communication is directly present.",
  "flows": "The code checks for module availability and sets flags accordingly, but there are no flows involving untrusted data reaching sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is straightforward compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules based on availability, sets version flags, and defines some type aliases. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All operations are standard for compatibility purposes. No suspicious patterns, code obfuscation, or malicious side effects are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
