{
  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, maintaining backwards compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various standard libraries, conditional imports based on environment and module availability.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports modules and sets compatibility flags.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard compatibility techniques and library imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries with conditional fallbacks to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It sets flags for Python version detection, and imports JSON handling modules, including a fallback for 'simplejson'. The use of 'try-except' blocks for optional dependencies is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. No obfuscation, malware, or malicious code features are detected. The code performs typical setup for a compatibility layer without any dangerous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2 and 3, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It employs normal import and version detection techniques, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
