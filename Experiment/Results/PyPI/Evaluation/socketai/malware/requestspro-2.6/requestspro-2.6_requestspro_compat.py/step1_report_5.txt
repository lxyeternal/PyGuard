{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and import handling for different Python versions and modules, ensuring backward compatibility and proper module imports for a package like requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables indirectly via sys.version_info, and attempts to import optional modules such as chardet and simplejson.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, execute code, or modify system state based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard compatibility checks and imports without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code handles module imports and version compatibility with straightforward logic. It conditionally imports modules based on availability, and sets up version flags. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is typical for compatibility layers, and no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Python packages, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs typical import handling and version checks for backward compatibility.",
