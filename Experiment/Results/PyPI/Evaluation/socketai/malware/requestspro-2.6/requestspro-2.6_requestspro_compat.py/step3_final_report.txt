  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports and version detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info for version detection.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward import and flag setting without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports with fallback options, detects Python version, and sets compatibility flags. It avoids external data handling, network operations, or code execution based on untrusted input. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no evidence of malicious or security-compromising behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0. The assessments are accurate and consistent.",
