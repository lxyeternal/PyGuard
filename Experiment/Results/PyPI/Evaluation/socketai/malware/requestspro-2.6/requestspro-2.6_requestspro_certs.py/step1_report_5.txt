  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package; calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'where()' function outputs the file path of the CA bundle; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> call where() -> output path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; simple and straightforward functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from 'certifi' to retrieve the path to the CA bundle and prints it. The code is minimal, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data inputs. There are no indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code serves a benign purpose related to SSL certificate management, consistent with its documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to output the location of the default CA bundle from 'certifi'. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior. No security risks are present.",
