{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package, primarily for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from certifi import where; usage of where() in the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The where() function returns a file path; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print(where()) — straightforward data flow without any external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, well-structured, and does not perform any unusual operations or include hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known and trusted package (certifi) to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. It prints this path when executed directly. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behavior, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and limited in scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that simply outputs the location of the certifi CA bundle. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, trusted utility with no security concerns.",
