{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for use in packaging or custom configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Code flow is from importing 'where' from certifi, then executing 'print(where())' if run as main, outputting the CA bundle location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; code is straightforward and intended for legitimate use. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package to retrieve the default CA bundle path. When executed directly, it prints this path. There are no external data inputs or untrusted data flows. The code's structure and comments indicate it is a utility module intended for packaging or configuration purposes. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed to output the path to the default CA bundle from certifi. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is straightforward, and it is safe.",
