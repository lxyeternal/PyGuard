{
  "purpose": "The script returns the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the certificate bundle location via the 'where' function imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'where' from certifi to printing its output, with no external data manipulation or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present; the code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a known and trusted library (certifi) and prints the path to the CA bundle. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or insecure behavior. The code is simple, limited to outputting a static, trusted resource location.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely to display the location of the CA bundle from the certifi package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are detected.",
