  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package, used for SSL verification in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package; execution of 'print(where())' when run as main.",
  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path; no untrusted data sources or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward utility that imports a trusted library and prints a known resource path. It contains no user input, network activity, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose and assign appropriate scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0). The code's simplicity and reliance on a well-maintained library further confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for exposing the certifi CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's function.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
