{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package, likely for use in SSL/TLS validation.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package, and the 'print(where())' statement.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used indirectly for SSL/TLS connections; no direct untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed to standard output; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses a well-known library as intended.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', a standard library for handling SSL certificates. It prints the path to the default CA bundle. No user input, network operations, or suspicious code are present. The code is simple and intended solely to reveal the CA bundle location, with no malicious intent or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to output the location of a trusted CA certificate bundle for SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
