  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requestspro' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative emojis.",
  "sources": "Reading metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded strings assigned to metadata variables; no external data input or untrusted sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and emojis is harmless and decorative; no suspicious code patterns, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string literals to metadata variables describing the package. It contains decorative comments and emojis, which are benign. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications or data leaks. The code adheres to typical package metadata standards without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
