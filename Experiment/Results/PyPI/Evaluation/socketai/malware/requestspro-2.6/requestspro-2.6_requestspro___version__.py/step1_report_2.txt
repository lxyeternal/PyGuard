  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requestspro' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emoji.",
  "sources": "Assignment of metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; purely static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative emoji (__cake__), but no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string and integer values to module-level variables that describe package metadata. No input reading, network operations, or untrusted data processing. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security issues detected. The code appears to be a standard metadata header for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define package metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
