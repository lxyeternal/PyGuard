{
  "purpose": "This module defines core classes and utilities for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URL strings, headers, cookies, data, files, JSON payloads, and hooks during request preparation; response content, headers, and status code during response handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the request body (for data, files, JSON), headers (especially 'Cookie' and 'Content-Type'), and response content (for JSON decoding and stream reading).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (URL, headers, data, files, JSON) through preparation methods (prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body) into the request object, and then over network into response content, which can be decoded or iterated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Use of standard libraries and functions appears normal. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution found. The code adheres to typical patterns for HTTP request/response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles the construction and processing of HTTP requests and responses, including URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, and JSON parsing. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network connections to suspicious domains. Functions like 'prepare_body' and 'json' perform standard encoding and decoding tasks. There are no unsafe eval calls, dynamic code execution, or hidden network activities. The code's structure and logic align with typical request handling workflows. The use of external libraries and internal methods appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP request and response handling within a client library. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. The code appears secure and well-structured for its purpose.",
