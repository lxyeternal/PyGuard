  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles request/response creation, URL encoding, header validation, cookie management, JSON decoding, and response content decoding. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the standard nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification:** The code performs typical HTTP client functions with no signs of malicious activity. The fallback decoding mechanisms are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing request construction, URL parsing, header validation, and response processing. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The code's functions are standard for an HTTP client library.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard request/response handling with safe data flows, no backdoors or malicious code. Uses external libraries appropriately.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation. The code is typical for such libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—standard patterns, no malicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent; the code is a typical HTTP handling module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard, secure request/response management, no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in request handling—mainly from potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into request parameters, but nothing specific in the code indicates a vulnerability.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — standard risk level for HTTP client code, mainly due to the possibility of untrusted data influencing request parameters or headers, but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library. No signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation are present. The low risk score reflects typical exposure in such libraries if misused, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
