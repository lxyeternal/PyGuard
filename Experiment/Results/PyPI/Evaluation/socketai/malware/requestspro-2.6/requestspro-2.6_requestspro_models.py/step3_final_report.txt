{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP request and response handling library, managing URL encoding, headers, cookies, JSON parsing, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL input, headers, request data, JSON payload, cookies, response raw stream",
  "sinks": "Header validation, request body, response content decoding, JSON deserialization",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding and request preparation, response content flows through decoding and JSON parsing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; fallback decoding mechanisms are standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and patterns for HTTP request/response management. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The decoding fallback is typical for robustness. The request and response handling is thorough and aligns with common secure practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk score (0.2) reflects typical handling of untrusted input but does not indicate any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
