  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling cookies, including extraction, creation, merging, and compatibility wrappers for cookie management in HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from subprocess outputs (parse_cookies), and from base64-decoded data in functions decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede. Also, request and response objects provide data through attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() on decrypted and decoded data in decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede, which can execute arbitrary code. Network requests via requestspro.post() and requestspro.get() in check_version can send data externally. The subprocess call may leak system information. No other sinks indicate data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from subprocess output or base64 decoding into decrypt_cookie/prepend_scheme_if_neede functions, where the data is executed via exec(). Network calls transmit system or version info to external URLs. The parse_cookies function's output is used as system identifier.",
  "anomalies": "The functions decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede decode base64 data and execute it dynamically via exec(), which is highly suspicious. Use of exec() with decoded external data indicates potential malicious code execution. The subprocess call retrieves system serial number, which could be used for fingerprinting or malicious tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard cookie management utilities and compatibility wrappers; however, the presence of functions that decode base64 data and execute it via exec() is a critical red flag. These functions could run malicious scripts delivered from external sources. The network requests send system info and version data, which could be used for tracking. The subprocess call retrieves hardware serial number, which may be used for device fingerprinting. Overall, while most functions seem benign and typical for cookie handling, the exec() calls and external network communication with system info are malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily manages cookies and makes external network requests. However, the use of base64 decoding combined with exec() to execute dynamically decoded code indicates malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution. These functions could be exploited to run arbitrary code, representing high security risk. The overall security risk is elevated due to these dynamic code executions, despite the otherwise legitimate cookie utilities.",
