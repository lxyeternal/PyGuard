  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious indicators, consistency of scores, and logical coherence.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Highlights functions `decrypt_cookie` and `prepend_scheme_if_neede` that decode base64 data and execute it via `exec()`.\n- Notes network requests and subprocess calls for system info.\n- Assigns high malware (0.75) and security risk (0.8) scores.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies the use of `exec()` on decoded external data as a red flag.\n- The network requests and subprocess for system info could be benign or malicious, but combined with `exec()`, they are suspicious.\n- The scores seem reasonable; high malware and risk scores reflect the malicious indicators.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Emphasizes `decrypt_cookie` and `prepend_scheme_if_neede` executing decoded data with `exec()`.\n- Mentions collection of system info via subprocess.\n- Assigns malware (0.85) and risk (0.8), obfuscated (1), confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies `exec()` on decoded data as malicious.\n- The higher malware score (0.85) is justified given the code's potential for remote code execution.\n- Obfuscated score at 1 is reasonable, considering the base64 decoding and dynamic execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Similar focus on `exec()` in `decrypt_cookie` and `prepend_scheme_if_neede`.\n- Notes system info collection.\n- Assigns malware (0.75), risk (0.8), obfuscated (0), confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower malware score (0.75) than previous, but still justified.\n- Obfuscated score at 0 is questionable; decoding and execution are obfuscation techniques.\n- The report correctly emphasizes the malicious potential.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Increase obfuscated score from 0 to at least 0.7, reflecting code decoding and dynamic execution.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Focuses on `exec()` on decoded data, system info collection.\n- Assigns malware (0.6), risk (0.7), obfuscated (0.7), confidence (0.8).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The malware score is somewhat lower than others; given the code's potential for remote code execution, it should be higher.\n- Obfuscated score at 0.7 is appropriate due to decoding and execution.\n- Overall, the reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Raise malware score to at least 0.75, matching the severity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Similar analysis: `exec()` on decoded data, system info collection.\n- Assigns malware (0.75), risk (0.8), obfuscated (0.9), confidence (0.8).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Obfuscated score at 0.9 is justified, given the decoding and execution pattern.\n- Malware score of 0.75 is appropriate.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports recognize `exec()` on decoded data as malicious. The highest malware score (0.85) is justified in Report 2; others are slightly lower but still high.  \n  **Proposed final malware score:** **0.8** (average of 0.75-0.85), reflecting high malicious potential.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Varies from 0 to 1. The use of base64 decoding, static keys, and dynamic execution strongly indicates obfuscation.  \n  **Proposed final obfuscated score:** **0.8** (average), as the code employs decoding and dynamic execution techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign high risk (~0.8). Given the potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, and system fingerprinting, this is justified.  \n  **Proposed final risk score:** **0.8**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjusted Scores:\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | **0.8**     |\n| Obfuscated         | **0.8**     |\n| Security Risk      | **0.8**     |\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The presence of `exec()` on base64-decoded, potentially malicious code is a critical red flag, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores.\n- The code's behavior to collect system info and send it externally further elevates the security risk.\n- Scores are consistent across reports and reflect the malicious indicators identified.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code exhibits high malicious potential primarily due to dynamic code execution via `exec()` on decoded external data, combined with system info exfiltration. It should be treated as malicious with high severity.",
