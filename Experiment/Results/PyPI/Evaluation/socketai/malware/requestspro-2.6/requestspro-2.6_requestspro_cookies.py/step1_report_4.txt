  "purpose": "Provides utilities for cookie management, cookie extraction, version checking, and decryption functions related to requestspro, including some potentially malicious decryption and dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Reading from subprocess (parse_cookies), network requests via requestspro.post/get, base64 decoding, and data passed to decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede functions.",
  "sinks": "exec() calls with decrypted data, network requests, subprocess calls, and potential modification of cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding and multiple decoding steps lead to decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede functions where decrypted code is executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded and decrypted data, which could execute malicious code. The decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede functions perform base64 decoding, then execute the resulting code, indicating possible malicious code obfuscation. The parse_cookies() function gathers hardware info using subprocess, which could be used for fingerprinting or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard cookie handling and network version checks, but contains potentially malicious behavior via the decrypt_cookie and prepend_scheme_if_neede functions that decode base64 strings, decrypt them, and then execute the code dynamically with exec(). This technique can be used to hide malicious payloads. The use of subprocess to get hardware serial number may be for fingerprinting. No hardcoded credentials are evident; third-party library usage is not suspicious in itself. The overall structure suggests a mix of legitimate cookie handling with embedded potentially malicious dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates potentially malicious behavior through the use of dynamic code execution via exec() on decrypted and decoded payloads, which could hide malicious activities. It also gathers hardware info that may be used for fingerprinting or exfiltration. While parts of the code perform legitimate cookie management, the presence of code decoding, decryption, and dynamic execution raises significant security concerns.",
