  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines exception classes for handling request errors. No data processing, no external input handling, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard exception hierarchy. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, exception class definitions with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe, straightforward code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, exception classes for error handling, no malicious code or data flow.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception and warning classes with a small securityRisk score (0.1). The reason given is that exception classes could potentially handle untrusted data, but no actual data flow or processing occurs here.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The minimal securityRisk score seems to be an overestimation. The code is purely class definitions with no data handling, so the risk is negligible.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard exception classes with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in Report 4 (0.1), but this is unjustified given the code content.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate at 0 across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are appropriate at 0.\n- The **securityRisk score** in Report 4 should be lowered from 0.1 to 0, as the code is purely class definitions with no data flow or processing that could introduce risk.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with the reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more accurate than 0.1 in Report 4)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard exception class hierarchy with no malicious or risky behavior. The only minor point is the unnecessary securityRisk score in Report 4, which should be adjusted downward.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the nature of the code, I see no reason to assign any risk scores above zero. The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for an error handling module.",
