{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests in the requestspro library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules (urllib3.exceptions, .compat), and defines exception classes used during runtime operations.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are likely used to handle errors that can be triggered by untrusted data inputs or network responses; no direct data leaks or malicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised during request handling, JSON decoding, or network issues, but there are no explicit flows of untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. Exception class definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines exception classes with no data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. It imports external exceptions and extends them for specific use cases. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The presence of warning classes is standard for handling deprecation and dependency issues. Overall, the code serves as an error handling framework without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for handling errors in an HTTP request library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
