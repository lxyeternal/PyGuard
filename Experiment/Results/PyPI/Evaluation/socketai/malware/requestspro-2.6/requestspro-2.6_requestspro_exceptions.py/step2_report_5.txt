  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for request handling, with no malicious activity or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious behavior. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No dynamic code, no external data processing, no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard exception classes, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code content.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Exception classes with some mention of potential untrusted data handling, but no actual data flows or malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1), citing potential handling of untrusted data but finds no actual evidence. Given the code only defines classes and constructors, this risk score seems to overstate the threat.  \n- **Justification:** Since no data is processed or transmitted, and no code executes dynamically, the risk is negligible. The small score might reflect cautiousness but isn't justified by the code.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, as the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others—standard exception class definitions with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 4, which assigns a small security risk (0.1) without supporting evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code is purely definitional and does not process or handle untrusted data in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe exception hierarchy with no security concerns.",
