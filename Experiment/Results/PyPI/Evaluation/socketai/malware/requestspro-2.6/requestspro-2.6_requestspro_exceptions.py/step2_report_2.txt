  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code defines exception classes for request handling.\n- No data leaks, malicious sinks, or suspicious flows.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Overall, a standard exception hierarchy with no security concerns.\n- Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (since it's just error handling, not entirely zero but minimal).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; confirms standard exception class definitions.\n- No external input processing or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, confirms straightforward exception class definitions.\n- No data processing or malicious code.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly notes that exception classes could handle untrusted data, but clarifies no actual data flow or external data processing occurs.\n- The security risk is noted as 0.1, likely due to the potential for untrusted data in exception handling, but no actual malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard for error handling modules).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others; confirms standard exception class definitions with no malicious patterns.\n- No external data processing or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code solely defines exception classes.\n- No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The only minor concern is the potential handling of untrusted data in exception contexts (Report 4), but it is explicitly dismissed as not being an actual risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (error handling class definitions), a low risk score of around 0.1 is appropriate, primarily due to the potential for untrusted data in exception contexts, but this is negligible here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for an HTTP request library. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the nature of the code.",
