  "purpose": "Defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in the requestspro library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compat module; class constructors and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially user-controlled data passed via exception arguments, but primarily internal error handling.",
  "flows": "Exception raising and handling, with no evidence of data flowing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines exception classes for error handling. It imports exceptions and constructs subclasses that do not perform any processing or data manipulation. No input validation or network operations occur here. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears to be standard exception hierarchy implementation for a request library.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of exception definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely as error classification and handling framework.",
