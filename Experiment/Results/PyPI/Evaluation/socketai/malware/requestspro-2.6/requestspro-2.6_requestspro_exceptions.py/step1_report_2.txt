{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in HTTP requests, primarily for the requestspro library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements and exception class initializations. No external inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely defines classes and does not process data flow or execute any operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The exception classes are standard and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exceptions related to HTTP requests, including handling JSON errors, connection issues, timeouts, and other request-related errors. It imports necessary modules, extends existing exception classes, and provides docstrings for clarity. There are no signs of code that reads external input dynamically, manipulates data insecurely, or includes malicious payloads. The code structure is straightforward, and all classes serve as error indicators without executing harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for an HTTP request library. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible, with no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns detected.",
