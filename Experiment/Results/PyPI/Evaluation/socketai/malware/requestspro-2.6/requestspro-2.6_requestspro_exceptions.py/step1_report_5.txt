{
  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for the requestspro library to handle various HTTP and JSON-related errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class methods and attributes; exception initializations.",
  "sinks": "None detected where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for request handling errors. It imports standard libraries and defines exception hierarchies with no evident data manipulation, external communication, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling is present. The structure is typical for a Python exceptions module, with proper inheritance and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exceptions module for a request handling library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
