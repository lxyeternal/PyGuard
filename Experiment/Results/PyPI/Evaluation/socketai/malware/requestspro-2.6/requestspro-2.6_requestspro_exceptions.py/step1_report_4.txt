{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors and warnings in the requestspro library, mainly related to HTTP operations, JSON decoding, connection issues, and protocol errors.",
  "sources": "The module reads from its own class initializers and attributes such as 'response' and 'request', as well as the imported 'HTTPError' and 'JSONDecodeError' from other modules.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes and their initializers that could potentially handle untrusted data or propagate errors; no explicit data sinks like network transmission, file writing, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows through class inheritance and exception handling constructs. Error objects are instantiated with arguments and attributes but do not contain or transmit untrusted input data or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code strictly defines exception classes and warnings with standard inheritance patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a requests library, using standard Python patterns. It imports exceptions from other modules, defines subclasses with constructors to preserve error messages, and establishes warning classes. No malicious or suspicious logic, external data handling, or network activity is detected. The design aligns with typical error handling structures. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard exception and warning class definitions for a HTTP request handling library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and clean, focused solely on error categorization and warnings.",
