{
  "purpose": "Provide case-insensitive dictionary-like data structures for handling headers and lookup objects within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__, __setitem__), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code mainly manipulates in-memory data structures without external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows through dictionary operations such as setting, getting, deleting, and iterating over keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code implements standard data structures with expected behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both serve as in-memory data containers. CaseInsensitiveDict handles case-insensitive keys with case-sensitive iteration, typical for HTTP headers. LookupDict is a simple dictionary with optional naming. No external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The implementation appears standard and intended for normal application use.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility data structures without any malicious or suspicious features. It performs standard operations with no signs of security risks or malware. The implementation aligns with typical library code for header and lookup management.",
