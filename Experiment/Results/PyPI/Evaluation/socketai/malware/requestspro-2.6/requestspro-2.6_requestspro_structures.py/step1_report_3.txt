{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive and lookup dictionary data structures used in requests-related code.",
  "sources": "Input data when initializing `CaseInsensitiveDict` and `LookupDict` via constructor or update methods.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary operations such as `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, and `__delitem__` that process keys and values; potential data access points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to internal storage (`OrderedDict`) and from internal storage to retrieval methods; no external or network flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code implements standard case-insensitive and lookup dictionary behavior without obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: `CaseInsensitiveDict`, which manages keys in a case-insensitive manner, storing original case for display and comparison purposes, and `LookupDict`, which provides a simple dictionary with a custom `__repr__` and a safe `__getitem__` that defaults to None. Both classes implement standard dictionary behaviors with no external or hidden data flows. There are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward utility data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries without malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic dictionary operations securely and transparently.",
