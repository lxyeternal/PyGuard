  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for the 'requestspro' package, handling version info, dependencies, testing, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec() from __version__.py; reads README.md; command-line arguments for publish; imports dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Executes setup() to install package; runs os.system() commands for publishing; executes code via exec().",
  "flows": "Reads version info with exec(); triggers os.system() commands for publishing; executes code via exec() based on command-line args.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on version file (common but risky if compromised); syntax errors in open() calls (likely typos); use of os.system() for publishing commands.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup file. It uses exec() to load version info, which is standard but can be dangerous if the version file is tampered with. The os.system() calls for publishing are straightforward but could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Syntax errors in open() calls are present but appear to be typos. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The main security concern is executing external code via exec() and system commands, which are common in such scripts but should be handled with caution. Overall, the code is benign but warrants best practices to mitigate potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary risks stem from the use of exec() and os.system(), which could be exploited if the version file is compromised or inputs are manipulated. The syntax errors are likely accidental. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of around 0.2-0.3 reflects typical concerns with such scripts. Overall, the script is benign but should be improved by replacing exec() with safer alternatives and avoiding os.system() for critical commands.",
