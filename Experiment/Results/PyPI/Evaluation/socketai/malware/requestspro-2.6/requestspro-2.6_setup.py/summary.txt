  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary risks stem from the use of exec() and os.system(), which could be exploited if the version file is compromised or inputs are manipulated. The syntax errors are likely accidental. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of around 0.2-0.3 reflects typical concerns with such scripts. Overall, the script is benign but should be improved by replacing exec() with safer alternatives and avoiding os.system() for critical commands."
