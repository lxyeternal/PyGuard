    "No explicit input validation for command-line arguments",
    "Inconsistent usage of open() with 'utf-8' encoding: incorrect syntax (second argument should be encoding='utf-8')"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for a Python package. It includes version checks, dependency management, and upload commands. Notably, it uses os.system() to run shell commands directly based on command-line arguments, which could be dangerous if arguments are manipulated maliciously. The code executes the contents of a version file via exec(), which can execute arbitrary code if the version file is compromised. The reading of files (README.md, __version__.py) is standard, but the syntax for open() calls contains errors (e.g., 'open(file, 'utf-8')' should be 'open(file, encoding='utf-8')')—these are likely typos rather than malicious. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious intent like data exfiltration or backdoors, but the use of os.system() and exec() can be considered risky and potentially exploitable under certain conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with minor syntactic issues. No malicious behavior is evident; however, its reliance on os.system() and exec() without validation poses security risks. These should be reviewed and sanitized to prevent exploitation. The package itself does not contain malware or malicious intent based on this code.",
