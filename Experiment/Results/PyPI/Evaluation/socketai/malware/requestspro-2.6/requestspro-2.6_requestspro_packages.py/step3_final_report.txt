{
  "purpose": "The code provides backwards compatibility by importing 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' and manipulating sys.modules to alias 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' under a custom namespace 'requestspro.packages'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'; dynamic sys.modules modifications for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries being overwritten or aliased, affecting module namespace resolution.",
  "flows": "Import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' → sys.modules modifications for 'urllib3', 'idna', 'chardet' → module namespace resolution during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic rewriting of sys.modules entries to remap modules under a custom namespace, which can be used for obfuscation or hiding module origins.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic sys.modules manipulation to alias standard packages under a custom namespace, which is an uncommon practice often associated with obfuscation or compatibility layers. No malicious payloads, network activity, or malicious code execution are evident. The techniques could be misused to hide malicious modules or evade detection, but in this context, they appear to serve compatibility purposes. The obfuscation score is justified by the unusual namespace handling, while the malware score remains low due to the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is moderate, considering potential misuse, but no active threat is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a compatibility workaround employing advanced namespace manipulation techniques. It does not contain malicious behavior but employs obfuscation methods that could be exploited maliciously. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.6, and security risk approximately 0.3, reflecting moderate caution due to obfuscation potential but no active malicious activity.",
