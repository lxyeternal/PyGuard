  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, referencing a suspicious URL. The behavior indicates malicious activity, such as remote code execution or data theft. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and embedded URL justify a high malware and security risk score. Further payload decoding is recommended for confirmation, but the current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious."
