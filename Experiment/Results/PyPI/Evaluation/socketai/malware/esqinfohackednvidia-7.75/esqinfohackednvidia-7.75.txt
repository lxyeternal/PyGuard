      "conclusion": "The script embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup, with indicators strongly pointing to malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. The package should be treated as malicious, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation of malicious actions."
