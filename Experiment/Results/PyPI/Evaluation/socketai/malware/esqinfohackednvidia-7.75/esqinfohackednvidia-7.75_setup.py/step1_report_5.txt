{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'esqinfohackednvidia' and may include malicious behavior by executing hidden PowerShell commands and downloading or executing external code.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem to check if 'tahg' exists; reading environment variables; executing subprocess commands; package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell command; potential external code download or execution via encoded PowerShell command",
  "flows": "File existence check -> If not exists, execute hidden PowerShell code -> Package setup details",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload which is suspicious; the URL embedded in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') is suspicious; the filename 'tahg' is obscure and may be used as a trigger or flag",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then attempts to run a subprocess with a hidden PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download or execute code from an external source. The package setup section includes typical metadata but is preceded by the malicious code. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The embedded URL and encoded command are suspicious indicators of potential malicious activity, possibly downloading or executing remote payloads, constituting a supply chain threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious and potentially malicious behavior, specifically executing a hidden PowerShell payload from an encoded command, likely intended for malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The package setup itself appears legitimate but is preceded by suspicious code that warrants suspicion and further investigation.",
