  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed covertly during setup, indicating malicious activity. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics such as hidden payload delivery and obfuscation. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants high alert and caution."
