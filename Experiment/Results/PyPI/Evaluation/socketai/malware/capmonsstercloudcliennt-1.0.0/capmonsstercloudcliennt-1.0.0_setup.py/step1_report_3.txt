  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting data, executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potential network requests via requests (if used within the decrypted code), imported modules that could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variable -> Conditional import of requests and Fernet -> Decrypting data -> Executing decrypted code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted data is suspicious; the decrypted code could execute arbitrary malicious instructions. The hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload are also suspicious, indicating potential malicious code concealment. The long description appears obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines setup configuration with minimal package info, but includes a custom install class 'GruppeInstall' which overrides the run() method. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts an embedded encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code via exec(). The decrypted code could contain any malicious instructions, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification. The use of exec() with decrypted data and embedded encrypted payloads suggests obfuscation and malicious intent. The setup also depends on the 'fernet' package being listed as a requirement, which is necessary for decryption, and could be used maliciously if the decrypted code is harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, using hardcoded keys and encrypted payloads. This pattern indicates malicious behavior and potential supply chain compromise.",
