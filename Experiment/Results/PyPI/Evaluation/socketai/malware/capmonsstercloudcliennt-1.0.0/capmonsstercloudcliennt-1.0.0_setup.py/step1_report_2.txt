{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package, including custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, imported modules (requests, fernet), encrypted Fernet key and encrypted payload, setup parameters",
  "sinks": "exec() call on decrypted code, import statements that load potentially malicious modules, encrypted payload execution",
  "flows": "On Windows, if os.name == 'nt', the code imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a payload and executes it via exec() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted payload is suspicious, especially as it occurs during installation. The encrypted code suggests obfuscation. Hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted data are unusual and could hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when run on Windows, imports modules and decrypts a payload using Fernet. It then executes this payload via exec(). The payload is encrypted with a hardcoded key, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious code. The setup configuration specifies package details with nonsensical names and descriptions, and includes setup_requires dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests'. The presence of code that decrypts and executes code during installation indicates potentially malicious intent, possibly acting as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism. No other suspicious behavior like data exfiltration, network connections, or credential use is evident outside this payload execution. The code appears intentionally obfuscated and malicious, given the context and execution method.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior that decrypts and executes a payload during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and the use of exec() suggest it could be used as a backdoor or to run malicious code. This package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
