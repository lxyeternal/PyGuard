{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform package installation, but it contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports requests and fernet modules, and accesses hardcoded encrypted payloads and keys within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, then executes the decrypted code via exec(), enabling potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encrypted payloads and keys, use of exec() on decrypted code, obfuscated description strings, and conditional execution only on Windows are unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during Windows installation, decrypts a hardcoded payload using Fernet with a hardcoded key and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and key are embedded directly, and the description strings are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The use of runtime decryption and execution of code during setup is a classic pattern of malicious backdoors or malware. The high malware score (~0.9), obfuscation (~0.8), and security risk (~0.9) are justified given the potential for arbitrary code execution and system compromise. The pattern is consistent across multiple reports, which correctly identify this as highly suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a high likelihood of malicious activity, acting as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation. The obfuscation and runtime code execution are typical of malicious tactics, warranting high security concern. The scores assigned are consistent and justified based on the behavior observed.",
