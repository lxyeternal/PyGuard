      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates a high likelihood of malicious activity, acting as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation. The obfuscation and runtime code execution are typical of malicious tactics, warranting high security concern. The scores assigned are consistent and justified based on the behavior observed."
