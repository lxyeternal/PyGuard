      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, with indicators of malicious intent such as obfuscation, silent execution, and a suspicious URL. While not conclusively proven malicious without decoding the command, the evidence justifies treating this as a high-risk, potentially malicious package. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and further investigation is recommended."
