      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with respect to security. The main concern is the unprofessional package name, which does not constitute a security threat but could be flagged for policy or professionalism reasons. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The risk scores should remain low, with a slight elevation due to the package name and dependencies, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution, strongly indicating malicious intent. It is designed to hide its true payload through multiple layers of decoding and eval, which is typical of malware trying to evade static analysis. Given the suspicious nature and obfuscation, it should be considered malicious and avoided."
