  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pussysus', including dependencies.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, package list, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies could be used to perform network or browser data access; no explicit sinks in this script.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are installed via 'install_requires'; no data flow beyond setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'pussysus' is unprofessional and potentially maliciously named; author fields are empty, which is unusual but not suspicious alone. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No suspicious code execution or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It defines package name, version, author info (empty), and required dependencies. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. While some dependencies could be misused if exploited (e.g., 'browser_cookie3' for cookie theft, 'discordwebhook' for malicious notifications, 'robloxpy' for gaming data, 'requests' for network activity), their mere inclusion in setup.py is not inherently malicious. The package name is unusual and potentially unprofessional but not malicious per se. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with dependencies that could be misused if malicious actors control the code using these dependencies. However, the script itself does not contain malicious code or behavior. The package name is unprofessional but not necessarily malicious.",
