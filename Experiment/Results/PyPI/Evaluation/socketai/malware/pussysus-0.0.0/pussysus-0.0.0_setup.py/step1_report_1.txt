{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list and the package name and version variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are listed as inputs; no flows of untrusted data to sensitive operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'pussysus' is unusual and potentially inappropriate. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code itself is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without any additional logic. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior. The only notable point is the questionable package name, which might be used for malicious purposes, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign in functionality, though the package name is unusual and could be associated with malicious intent if used improperly. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected in the code provided.",
