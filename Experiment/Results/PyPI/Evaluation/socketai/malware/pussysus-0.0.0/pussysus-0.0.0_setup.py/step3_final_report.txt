  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with an unprofessional package name.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration without dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'pussysus'; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup script that defines package metadata and dependencies. The package name is unprofessional but not malicious. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Dependencies listed could be misused if malicious code were present, but in this context, they are benign. The absence of code execution, data flow, or hardcoded secrets indicates no malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with respect to security. The main concern is the unprofessional package name, which does not constitute a security threat but could be flagged for policy or professionalism reasons. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The risk scores should remain low, with a slight elevation due to the package name and dependencies, but overall, the code is safe.",
