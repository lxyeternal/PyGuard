{
  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'pussysus' with specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies from the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'pussysus' is unusual and potentially inappropriate; author fields are empty but not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version variable, and calls setup() with package info. The dependencies listed include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. There are no code execution, user input handling, or network activity within this script. The package name may be considered inappropriate or unprofessional, but does not indicate malicious intent. The setup script itself does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with an unusual package name but no malicious or security risk indicators. No malware or security risks are evident from this code.",
