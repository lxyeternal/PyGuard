  "purpose": "This code is a documentation helper for AWS CLI, generating formatted help content, topics, and command descriptions by reading static files and class attributes. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing.",
  "sources": "Static files (e.g., global_options.rst, topic files), class attributes, documentation strings, environment variables indirectly via os.path",
  "sinks": "Formatted documentation output, references, links, and content written to documentation objects",
  "flows": "Static content and file data flow into formatted documentation output; no untrusted data or network data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "Reads from static, predefined files; no code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured documentation generator for AWS CLI help content, topics, and commands. It reads static files and class attributes, then outputs formatted documentation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. File reads are from controlled, static sources intended for documentation. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and designed solely for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate documentation utility with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is minimal (0.1) due to static file reading, which is typical for such tools.",
