  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python AWS CLI tool, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Read functions for version info and long description, sys.argv for command-line args, environment variables (implicitly through sys.argv), and package data files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() function, importing of 'py2exe', and file operations.",
  "flows": "Read version and description from files -> Execute setup() with package info -> Conditional import and configuration for py2exe -> Final setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'py2exe' for Windows executable creation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard package setup code. No obfuscated code or unusual logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info from source files, defining dependencies, and configuring packaging options. The conditional inclusion of 'py2exe' is a common practice for Windows distributions. No suspicious data flows, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors are identified. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script without malicious intent or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily reads package metadata and dependencies, with optional Windows executable configuration. No malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious code injection detected.",
