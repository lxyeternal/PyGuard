  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging the 'awscl' CLI tool, configuring dependencies, versioning, and optional Windows packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'awscli/__init__.py', description from 'README.rst', dependencies list, and conditional import of 'py2exe'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'setup()' with configuration data; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Reads files for version and description, then passes configuration to 'setup()'. No dynamic or malicious code execution detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is the conditional inclusion of 'py2exe' for Windows packaging, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration. It reads static files, defines dependencies, and conditionally includes Windows packaging options. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The 'py2exe' block is a common packaging step and does not introduce security risks. All external scripts are standard for CLI tools and are not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The slight elevation in securityRisk in one report (0.2) is unwarranted; it should be 0, given the benign nature of the code.",
