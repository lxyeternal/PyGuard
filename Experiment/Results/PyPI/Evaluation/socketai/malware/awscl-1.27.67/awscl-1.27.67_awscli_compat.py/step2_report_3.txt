  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a compatibility and environment detection utility, reading system info, handling I/O, signals, and platform-specific behaviors. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on environment detection, system info, and compatibility utilities. No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The functions are standard for system utilities, with no signs of malicious intent. The slightly higher security risk score is acceptable but still low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a system utility library for environment detection, input/output handling, and platform specifics. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The content and analysis are aligned. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—compatibility, environment detection, system info, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior findings. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility utilities, system info, cross-platform functions, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate zero, which is consistent with the code content. The code is a standard system utility library, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The highest is 0.2, which is low and appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- No modifications needed; the assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard environment detection utility)\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security posture of this dependency is very safe. It is a legitimate, well-understood utility library for environment detection and compatibility, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
