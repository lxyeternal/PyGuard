  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities, environment info, system detection, and platform-specific handling for CLI operations.",
  "sources": "Reads system info files (e.g., Linux distro files), environment variables, user input, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout/stderr, executes shell commands for pagers, reads system files, and manages signals.",
  "flows": "Reads system info files and environment variables; outputs environment info; executes shell commands for paging; manages signals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; standard system detection logic; controlled use of shell=True for pagers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a cross-platform compatibility and environment detection library, handling I/O, signals, and system info. It uses standard patterns for CLI utilities, platform-specific behaviors, and system info retrieval. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of shell=True in get_popen_kwargs_for_pager_cmd() is justified given the controlled context (pager commands). The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical utility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign system utility library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, considering the controlled use of shell commands. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
