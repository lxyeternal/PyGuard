{
  "purpose": "Define an interface for CLI commands in a software project, likely related to AWS CLI.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing paths are present, as the code defines an abstract class/interface.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard abstract base class with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'CLICommand' with properties and methods meant to be overridden in subclasses. It contains abstract methods that enforce implementation in derived classes. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are visible. The code appears to be a boilerplate interface for CLI commands, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class for CLI command interface, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
