  "purpose": "Define an interface for CLI command classes used in AWS SDK or CLI tools.",
  "sources": "Class properties and methods, specifically property getters/setters and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the class is a base interface with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class 'CLICommand' for defining CLI commands with properties and methods but no concrete implementation. All methods and properties are either abstract or placeholders with no data processing, external calls, or sensitive data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code is consistent with a standard interface pattern and contains no obfuscated or malicious code. It is designed for extendability in CLI command implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured interface definition for CLI commands with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform external actions. Overall, it appears safe.",
