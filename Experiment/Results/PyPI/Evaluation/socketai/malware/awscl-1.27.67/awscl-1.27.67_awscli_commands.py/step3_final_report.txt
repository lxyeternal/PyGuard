  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for CLI commands, serving as a base class for specific command implementations.",
  "sources": "Properties 'name', 'lineage', 'lineage_names', 'arg_table'; method '__call__'; method 'create_help_command'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the class is an interface with no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward abstract class with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract class defining an interface for CLI commands, with properties and methods meant to be implemented by subclasses. It contains no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's structure and documentation are clear, and it serves as a base template. The absence of runtime logic or external interactions indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface class with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
