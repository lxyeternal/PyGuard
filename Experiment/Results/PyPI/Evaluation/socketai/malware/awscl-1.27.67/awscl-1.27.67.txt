The primary security risk stems from the potential execution of malicious plugin code if plugin paths are untrusted or compromised. Proper validation or sandboxing of plugin modules is recommended to mitigate supply chain risks. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the external dependency risk."
