  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands conditioned on filesystem state, with comments indicating suspicious sources. Scores of malware (~0.8), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.85) are justified. The package should be flagged for further analysis, deobfuscation of the payload, and cautious handling."
