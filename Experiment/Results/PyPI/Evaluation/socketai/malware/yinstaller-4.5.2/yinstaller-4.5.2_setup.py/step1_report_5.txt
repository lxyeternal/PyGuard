{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs an installation process, potentially including additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs in the 'send()' function, requests.get() calls, and os.system() command execution.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (potential data exfiltration), executing downloaded file via os.system(), and sending data over HTTP.",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sending HTTP request with this info -> Downloading and executing a file based on platform -> Sending data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Code attempts to send system info to an external URL, downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain, and executes it without validation. The URL 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com' look suspicious and possibly malicious. The use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and defines a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this info via HTTP GET to a remote server. If on Windows, it downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it silently. The 'PostInstallCommand' class invokes 'send()' during installation. The setup configuration specifies a package 'yinstaller' but the malicious-looking 'send()' function operates unconditionally during installation, indicating potential malicious behavior. The URLs and actions strongly suggest an attempt at system information theft and remote code execution, typical of supply chain malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info, exfiltrating it, and downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent. The overall security risk is high due to these actions. The code appears intentionally malicious, with a high malware score.",
