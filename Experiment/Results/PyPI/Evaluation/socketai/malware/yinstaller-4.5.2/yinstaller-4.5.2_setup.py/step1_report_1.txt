  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'yinstaller' that installs dependencies and runs post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetching a URL with requests, executing a downloaded file via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing a potentially downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to send data -> Downloaded file -> os.system execution of the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves system environment info and sends it to an external server, then downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and system modules. The 'send' function collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL, passing the environment data. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it automatically. This behavior indicates potential backdoor or malware activity, as it runs arbitrary code without user knowledge or consent. The setup configuration does not restrict or warn about this behavior, and the code execution via os.system is dangerous. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system info, downloads, and executes a remote executable without user approval. This indicates a high probability of malicious intent, making the package dangerous to install.",
