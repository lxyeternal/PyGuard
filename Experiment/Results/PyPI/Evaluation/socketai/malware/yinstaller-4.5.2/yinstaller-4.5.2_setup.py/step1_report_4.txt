{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package installation process and performs additional actions during installation, including sending environment information and downloading and executing an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and executes downloaded files using os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded files via os.system, and making network requests with potentially malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> Sending data via HTTP request; Downloaded content from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' -> Executed via os.system('start '+filename).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to an external server, downloading an executable from a suspicious URL, and executing it automatically during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that gathers the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this data via an HTTP request to a domain 'linkedopports.com'. It then downloads an executable from 'python-release.com' and runs it without any user confirmation or security checks. The 'PostInstallCommand' class hooks into the installation process to call 'send'. The setup configuration registers this custom install command. Overall, the code performs potentially malicious actions such as data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation, which are characteristic of malicious supply chain behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing a remotely downloaded executable without user consent, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It should be considered dangerous for distribution or use.",
