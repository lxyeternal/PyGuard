  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', and executing a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Executing a downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') via os.system after download, and sending data to an external URL with environment info.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to 'linkedopports.com' -> Downloaded executable ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') -> os.system executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a generic try-except block suppressing errors, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, and sending environment info to an external server without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to send environment data to an external server, then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it automatically during package installation. The send() function executes untrusted code without validation, potentially installing malicious software. The use of os.system for executing external files and the obfuscated behavior of downloading and executing a remote executable indicates malicious intent. The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding potential issues or detection.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data, downloading, and executing a potentially malicious executable during installation, representing a security risk. The overall malicious score is high, and the package should be considered dangerous.",
