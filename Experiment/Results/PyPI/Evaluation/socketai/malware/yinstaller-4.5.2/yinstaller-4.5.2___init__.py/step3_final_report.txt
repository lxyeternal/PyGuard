{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'installed' and executes it immediately, serving as a minimal indicator or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources are used; the code is static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or outputs; only a print statement is executed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial, static function that outputs a message. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
