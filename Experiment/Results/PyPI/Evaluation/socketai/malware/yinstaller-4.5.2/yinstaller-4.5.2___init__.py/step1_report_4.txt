  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "There is no flow from external input to any sink; the code only executes a fixed print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or hidden elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a function definition that prints a static message. It then immediately calls this function. There are no external data sources, no input parsing, no network activity, no manipulation of environment variables, nor any complex logic that could be malicious. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, simple, and free from malicious behavior or security risks. It only outputs a static message.",
