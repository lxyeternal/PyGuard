  "purpose": "The script demonstrates the use of the colorama library to print colored output to stdout and stderr, ensuring that ANSI escape sequences are handled correctly when stderr is redirected.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from the standard output (print statements) and standard error (print with file=sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "Outputting colored text to stdout and stderr; no untrusted data is used, but the print statements send data to system outputs.",
  "flows": "Prints colored messages to stdout and stderr; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Usage of colorama appears standard and intentional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama for cross-platform colored output, initializes it, and then prints colored messages to stdout and stderr. It verifies that ANSI sequences do not interfere when stderr is redirected. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external data input or untrusted sources are involved. The purpose appears to be demonstrative or testing in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing or demonstrating color output handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
