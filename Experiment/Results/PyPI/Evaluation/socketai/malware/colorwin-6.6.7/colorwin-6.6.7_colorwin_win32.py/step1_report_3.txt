{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of utility functions for interacting with the Windows console, including retrieving console info, setting text attributes, cursor positioning, and setting the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads include importing modules (ctypes, wintypes), obtaining console handles (_GetStdHandle), and retrieving console buffer info (_GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo).",
  "sinks": "Functions that send data to system APIs, such as _SetConsoleTextAttribute, _SetConsoleCursorPosition, _FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, _FillConsoleOutputAttribute, and _SetConsoleTitleW, which modify console display attributes or title.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs like handle IDs, positional coordinates, attribute values, and title strings into Windows API calls that modify console state. No untrusted input is processed; data flows are mostly for system configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code performs standard console manipulation. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code is Windows-specific and relies on standard system APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of console interface utilities that use Windows API functions via ctypes. It includes conditionally importing modules, defining structures, and wrapping API calls with safety checks and adjustments. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. The code does not process user input or network data, nor does it perform any data exfiltration or hidden operations. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to console management. The absence of external data handling, cryptic code, or obfuscated elements suggests it's a benign utility library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Windows console utility implementation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It primarily interacts with Windows system APIs for console manipulation. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
