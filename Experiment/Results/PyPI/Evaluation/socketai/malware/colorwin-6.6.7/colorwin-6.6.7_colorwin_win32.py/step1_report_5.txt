{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for interacting with Windows console APIs, such as retrieving console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor positioning, filling output, and setting the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard output and error handles using Windows API functions (_GetStdHandle), as well as input parameters such as stream IDs and strings for setting console titles.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions that modify console display attributes and cursor position, which are generally benign; no direct sink involved with untrusted data that leads to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., stream IDs, position coordinates, strings) flow into Windows API calls that modify console states or display; no untrusted data from external sources appears to be processed in a way that affects system security or leaks information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. No network activity, file modifications, or reverse shell behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward API wrapper functions with proper type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions wrapping Windows console API calls, with conditional imports for Windows-specific modules. It includes functions for retrieving console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, filling console output, and setting the console title. The functions perform parameter validation, such as adjusting cursor positions and checking bounds, but do not process untrusted input data that could lead to code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured and appears to be a legitimate library for console manipulation without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of Windows console API wrappers intended for console management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats. The overall security risk is minimal, and there is no evidence of malware. It appears to be a safe utility module for console interactions.",
