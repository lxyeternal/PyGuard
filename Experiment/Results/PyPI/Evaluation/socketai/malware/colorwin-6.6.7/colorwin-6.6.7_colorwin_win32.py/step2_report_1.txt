  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a benign wrapper around Windows console APIs, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected; low security risk is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis confirms benign console utility functions with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling, standard API usage.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review indicates standard console API wrappers with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; scores match the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a straightforward Windows console utility library, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with previous ones—benign console API wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is a standard console API wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's benign purpose.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a slight increase from 0 due to potential misuse of console functions, but still very low)\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks beyond the trivial potential for console manipulation. The code appears to be a safe, standard utility module for Windows console interactions.",
