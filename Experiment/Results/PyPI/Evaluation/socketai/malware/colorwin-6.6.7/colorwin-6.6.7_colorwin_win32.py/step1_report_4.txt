{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for interacting with the Windows console, such as setting text attributes, cursor position, and console title, mainly for display customization in command-line interfaces.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and wintypes, calls to Windows API functions like GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitleW.",
  "sinks": "API functions that modify console display attributes and output, potentially affecting the user interface, but not handling untrusted external input directly.",
  "flows": "Functions obtain console handles, retrieve or modify console state, and set visual properties; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, nor is there any network or file I/O involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. The code strictly wraps Windows API calls for console management. The presence of conditional imports and fallback lambdas suggests compatibility handling but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows console API functions, primarily for console text and cursor manipulation. It checks for Windows API availability, defines relevant structures and function prototypes, and provides utility functions for console interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The code does not process untrusted inputs or contain hidden or obfuscated logic. Its purpose appears benign and focused solely on console customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for console display management on Windows systems. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module. It simply exposes Windows API functions with appropriate safety checks and fallbacks.",
