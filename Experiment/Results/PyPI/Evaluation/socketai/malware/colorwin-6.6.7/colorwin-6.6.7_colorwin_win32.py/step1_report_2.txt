{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for interacting with the Windows console API, such as retrieving console info, setting text attributes, cursor position, and title.",
  "sources": "Reads standard output and error handles via GetStdHandle, and console info via GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.",
  "sinks": "Uses console API functions that modify console display attributes, cursor position, and title; potential to affect console environment but no malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input sources (standard handles) are used by functions that modify console state (e.g., SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle). No data flows externally or untrusted data to these functions, only internal console control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code is well-structured and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Windows console API functions, defines structures for console info, and provides wrapper functions for console manipulation. It performs environment queries and manipulations without external data input. The use of ctypes and Windows API is standard for console handling. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or covert data transmission are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for Windows console interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It simply wraps Windows console API calls for console control.",
