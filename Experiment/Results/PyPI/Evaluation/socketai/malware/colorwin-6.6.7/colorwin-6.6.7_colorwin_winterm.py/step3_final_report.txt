  "purpose": "A Windows console manipulation utility providing functions to set text colors, styles, cursor positions, clear screen/lines, and set window titles using the win32 API.",
  "sources": "win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition, win32.FillConsoleOutputCharacter, win32.FillConsoleOutputAttribute, win32.SetConsoleTitle",
  "sinks": "win32 API calls affecting console buffer info, cursor position, screen content, and console title",
  "flows": "API functions retrieve console info (sources), then modify console attributes, cursor, or content (sinks) based on internal logic",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of Windows API for console control, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Windows console control class, wrapping win32 API calls for setting text attributes, cursor position, clearing screen/lines, and setting titles. It does not process external input, perform network activity, or handle data beyond console display management. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are simple wrappers around well-known Windows API calls, with clear logic and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate Windows console utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code is safe for use, and the assessments are justified.",
