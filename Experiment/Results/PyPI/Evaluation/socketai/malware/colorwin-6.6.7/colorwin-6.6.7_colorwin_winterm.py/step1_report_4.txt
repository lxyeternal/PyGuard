{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for manipulating Windows console attributes, cursor position, and screen contents, primarily for visual formatting and control.",
  "sources": "Reads console buffer info (win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo), console handle identifiers (win32.STDOUT, win32.STDERR), and console title (win32.SetConsoleTitle).",
  "sinks": "Uses win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute and win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition to modify console appearance and position, and win32.SetConsoleTitle to set window title.",
  "flows": "Reads console info via win32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo; writes console attributes and cursor position via win32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, win32.SetConsoleCursorPosition, and win32.SetConsoleTitle.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code strictly interacts with Windows console API for formatting and display control. No network, file, or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of classes to manipulate Windows console features, including colors, styles, cursor positioning, and screen clearing. It uses standard win32 API calls for these operations, with no evident malicious logic or suspicious behavior. It does not include any network communication, data leakage, or backdoor mechanisms. All functions serve legitimate purposes related to terminal display management. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign console manipulation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It relies on standard Windows console API functions to control terminal output formatting and cursor movements. There are no signs of malware or malicious data handling.",
