      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that connect to suspicious external domains, indicating high malicious potential. The pattern of decoding and executing hidden code is a common tactic in malware distribution. Based on the evidence, the overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for ANSI sequence handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to reliance on external classes but no actual malicious activity."
