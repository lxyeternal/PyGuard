  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that connect to suspicious external domains, indicating high malicious potential. The pattern of decoding and executing hidden code is a common tactic in malware distribution. Based on the evidence, the overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
