  "purpose": "A simple command-line demo script using colorama to style output text based on user input for color, background, and style.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "User input (arguments) -> argument parsing -> style attribute retrieval -> styled print output.",
  "anomalies": "Potential mismatch between default argument values and choices due to case sensitivity; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of using colorama with argparse. It defines functions to extract attribute names and retrieve attribute values. Choices for arguments are generated from attribute names converted to lowercase, while the find() function accesses attributes using uppercase keys, which is consistent if user inputs are lowercase. Default values like 'RESET' and 'RESET_ALL' are valid in colorama. No network, file, or malicious operations are present. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code is safe, with no obfuscation or security issues. Minor inconsistency in choice handling is noted but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
