{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal color and cursor control.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines functions and classes that generate escape sequences based on predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code outputs escape sequences as strings but does not execute or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It only provides ANSI code generation functions and classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and functions to generate ANSI escape sequences for colors, styles, and cursor control in terminal outputs. It uses straightforward string concatenation and class attribute initialization to produce escape sequences based on predefined numeric codes. There are no external data inputs, no network communications, and no code execution or dynamic evaluation. The code appears to be a standard utility module for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for generating ANSI escape codes. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or data leakage mechanisms. It appears safe for use in terminal-based applications.",
