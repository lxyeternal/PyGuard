{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, including colors, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Functions and class attributes that generate escape sequences based on static constants and parameters provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external untrusted input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "Function calls with parameters generate escape sequences; no external data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and classes that generate these sequences dynamically based on input parameters. It does not handle external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The functions are simple and static, serving as utilities for terminal styling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. Minor concerns about parameter usage are acknowledged but do not constitute actual security risks within this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no significant security risk. The slight potential misuse via parameters is minimal and controlled, making the overall security posture safe.",
