{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text styling, such as colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining escape sequences, functions generating escape sequences based on input parameters, class attributes defining color codes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any function returning an escape sequence could be used to inject control characters into terminal output, but no untrusted input is used to generate these sequences directly in the code.",
  "flows": "The code converts predefined numeric codes into escape sequences; no external data flows into these functions or classes, and no user input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, defining escape sequences and classes with static attributes representing terminal control codes. There are no signs of obfuscated or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and functions to generate control sequences dynamically based on input parameters. It includes classes with color and style codes, which are initialized to contain properly formatted escape sequences. The code is well-structured, with no use of external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. It serves as a utility for terminal text styling and cursor control, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling using ANSI escape codes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
