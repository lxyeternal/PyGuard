  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal coloring and cursor control.",
  "sources": "Constants defining ANSI codes, class attribute values, and functions that generate escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Functions returning ANSI escape sequences used to modify terminal output or cursor position.",
  "flows": "Constant definitions -> class attributes -> method calls to generate escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code solely generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal control. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, classes, and functions to produce ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring and cursor movements. It uses standard string concatenation and attribute definitions. No input/output streams, network activity, or external system calls are present. No obfuscated or malicious logic; the code is straightforward and serves a clear purpose related to terminal formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal display formatting and cursor control. It contains no malicious behavior, no signs of malware, and poses no security risk. It is a safe utility module for terminal text formatting.",
