{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and cursor control, such as setting colors, styles, and cursor positions.",
  "sources": "The code defines static ANSI escape sequences and color/style constants; no external input or data is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output operations involving untrusted data are present; the code only constructs and returns escape sequences.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; functions generate static escape codes or simple parameterized sequences.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses class attributes to define ANSI codes and dynamically wraps them into escape sequences upon instantiation. No hidden or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, including colors and cursor movements. It initializes classes with static attributes representing ANSI codes, and the instantiation dynamically wraps these values into escape sequences. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no code that manipulates data in an insecure or malicious manner. The code's structure is straightforward, primarily defining constants and simple functions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library for terminal styling using ANSI codes, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module.",
