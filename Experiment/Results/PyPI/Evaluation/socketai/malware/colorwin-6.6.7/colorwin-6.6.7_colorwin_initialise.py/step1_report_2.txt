{
  "purpose": "This code manages the initialization, wrapping, and resetting of standard output and error streams, particularly for handling ANSI escape sequences on Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, atexit functions, AnsiToWin32 class instantiation",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams, which could potentially be replaced or wrapped",
  "flows": "Initialization functions replace sys.stdout/sys.stderr with wrapped streams; reset_all restores original streams; context manager init/deinit manages stream wrapping lifecycle",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity. Usage of global variables for stream handling is standard here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages stream wrapping for ANSI escape sequence handling using the AnsiToWin32 class. It registers cleanup functions with atexit to restore original streams. The functions include init, deinit, reinit, and a context manager colorama_text. All operations are standard stream management routines. No suspicious behavior, external network calls, or malicious code is detected. The only notable point is reliance on the AnsiToWin32 class, but without its implementation, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\nNo hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is well-structured and appears to be part of a larger library for terminal formatting. The overall security posture is benign.\n\nGiven the absence of suspicious activity, malicious code, or security risks, the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing console stream wrapping, specifically for ANSI escape sequence handling on Windows. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
