{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages ANSI to Win32 console output wrapping, primarily for handling colored output across platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams during initialization, reinitialization, and deinitialization.",
  "targets": "The code modifies sys.stdout and sys.stderr to wrap them with an ANSI handling stream; no untrusted data flows are evident beyond normal stream handling.",
  "flows": "Input streams (sys.stdout and sys.stderr) are wrapped with AnsiToWin32 objects; the wrapped streams are used for output. No external data sources or untrusted inputs directly influence the data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard stream handling and wrapping for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code manages ANSI escape sequence handling for console output by replacing sys.stdout and sys.stderr with wrapped versions. The wrap_stream function conditionally wraps the streams with AnsiToWin32 objects if wrapping is enabled. There is proper cleanup and reinitialization support. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code execution mechanisms are present. The code uses standard modules like atexit and contextlib for cleanup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate console output handling for cross-platform support. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is benign, focusing on ANSI escape sequence processing. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
