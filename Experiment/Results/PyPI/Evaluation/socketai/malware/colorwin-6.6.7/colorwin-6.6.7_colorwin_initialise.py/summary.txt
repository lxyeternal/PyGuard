  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for ANSI sequence handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score can be conservatively set to 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to reliance on external classes but no actual malicious activity."
