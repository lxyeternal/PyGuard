  "purpose": "Customize installation process to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing curl command to POST system information to Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands and environment data) feed into variables that are then formatted into a JSON payload sent via os.system() to a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system information, including hostname, current user, IP configuration, and public IP, then sends this data externally without explicit user consent or clear purpose. The Slack webhook URL is hardcoded, exposing sensitive communication endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the install process to gather system details based on OS platform. It uses os.popen() to execute system commands and retrieve data such as system info, network configurations, and user info. The collected data is assembled into a JSON message and sent via a curl POST request to a predefined Slack webhook URL. This behavior appears to be designed to exfiltrate system details during package installation, potentially without user knowledge or consent. The use of hardcoded URL and collection of sensitive information constitutes a significant privacy and security concern. No code injection or destructive behavior is detected; however, the data collection and exfiltration approach are suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information during installation and send it to an external Slack webhook. This activity resembles data exfiltration, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the hardcoded webhook URL and extensive system data collection. It indicates potentially malicious intent related to privacy invasion or unauthorized data harvesting.",
