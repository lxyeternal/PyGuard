  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from os.popen() for system commands ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist') and os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "Executes a curl command with os.system() to send a POST request containing system info to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source: os.popen() commands capturing system info -> Data stored in variables -> Data inserted into a JSON payload -> Payload sent via os.system() curl command to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() for executing system commands and capturing output; sending detailed system info to an external URL; use of hardcoded webhook URL; no authentication or encryption for data transmission; printing a static string '-----------------hello-----------------------'.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the install command to collect system information depending on the platform. It gathers OS info, IP configuration, current directory, username, hostname, and other details using system commands via os.popen(). Then, it constructs a JSON payload including these details and sends it to a specified Slack webhook URL using os.system() with a curl command. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the collected data includes potentially sensitive information such as hostname, username, IP addresses, and system details. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data theft, backdoors, or malicious payloads, but the behavior of exfiltrating system info without user consent is suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself but could be misused for surveillance or data collection without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information during package installation and exfiltrate it via a Slack webhook. While this does not constitute malware per se, the behavior raises security concerns related to privacy and unconsented data transmission. There is no evidence of malicious sabotage or backdoors, but the exfiltration mechanism and hardcoded webhook suggest potential misuse.",
