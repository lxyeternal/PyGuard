  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system information via os.popen (uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, hostname, whoami, curl to fetch public IP).",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command to POST data to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from various sources, stored in variables, then passed into a formatted curl command which sends data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting sensitive system info and automatically sending it to an external Slack webhook without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is suspicious and indicates potential exfiltration or backdoor activity.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install process to gather extensive system information (hostname, user, IP, OS info) on various platforms. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this info and sends it via a curl POST request to a fixed Slack webhook URL. The collection of data and automatic transmission without user awareness or opt-in suggests malicious intent, potentially as a backdoor or information leak. The hardcoded webhook URL further indicates malicious or at least suspicious activity. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are evident; the main concern is the unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect and exfiltrate system information during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It appears to be a covert data collection mechanism, possibly for unauthorized surveillance or backdoor purposes.",
