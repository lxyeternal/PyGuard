{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, likely for surveillance or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to gather system info, hostname, username, IP configuration, OS info, and current directory; os.system() executing curl command to send data.",
  "sinks": "The curl command via os.system() transmits collected data to an external webhook URL, leading to potential data leakage.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info collection) feed into the data sent by the curl command in os.system(), resulting in exfiltration during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during installation; hardcoded webhook URL; use of os.popen() and os.system() for network communication; no user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system information using os.popen() and sends it to an external URL via os.system() with curl. This occurs during the package's install process, raising privacy and security concerns. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present, but the behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or surveillance. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The main risk stems from unconsented data collection and transmission, which could be exploited maliciously. The scores should reflect high privacy risk but moderate malware likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior due to covert data exfiltration during installation, raising privacy and security concerns. While not containing malicious payloads or destructive actions, its intent to secretly transmit system info justifies high security risk. The malware score should be moderate, acknowledging the privacy invasion without classifying it as active malware.",
