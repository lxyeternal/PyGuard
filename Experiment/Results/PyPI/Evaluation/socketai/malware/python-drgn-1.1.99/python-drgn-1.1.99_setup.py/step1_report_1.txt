{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include system commands such as 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'tasklist'.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is an os.system call that posts collected data to an external Slack webhook URL using a constructed JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands (sources) into variables, which are then formatted into a JSON string and sent via an external HTTP POST request through os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information and transmits it remotely without any user consent or clear purpose; use of 'curl' and 'os.system' for data exfiltration is suspicious. Also, the 'public_ip' variable is overwritten by 'tasklist' on Windows, which is inconsistent and potentially malicious. The hardcoded Slack webhook URL indicates possible data leakage or remote monitoring.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to run during package installation. It gathers system details such as OS info, network configuration, current directory, and user identity through various system commands. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this information and sends it to a Slack webhook URL using 'os.system'. The use of system commands for gathering environment details combined with the transmission of this data to an external service without user knowledge is suspicious. The code does not perform any malicious destructive actions, but it does exfiltrate potentially sensitive system information, which indicates malicious intent or privacy violations. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL further supports malicious or tracking behavior. No obfuscation or malware code is present beyond the data collection and transmission logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be collecting extensive system information and secretly transmitting it to an external webhook during installation, which is suspicious and could be malicious. It may be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent.",
