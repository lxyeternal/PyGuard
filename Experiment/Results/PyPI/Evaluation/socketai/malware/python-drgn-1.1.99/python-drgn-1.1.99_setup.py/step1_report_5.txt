  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package that collects system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using os.popen (e.g., 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig'), current working directory, username ('whoami'), hostname, and makes an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook with collected data.",
  "sinks": "The data collected from system commands and variables are formatted into a JSON payload and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (Slack webhook). The os.system call also executes a curl command with the collected data.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system info commands and environment data flow into the string formatting used in the curl command, which then sends this data over the network to the Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive system information (hostname, username, IP configurations, system details) and sends it externally without user consent or clear purpose. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, indicating possible exfiltration behavior. No user input is involved, and the data collection appears to serve no legitimate debugging or installation purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the installation process to gather various system details using shell commands, which are platform-dependent. It then composes a message including the system information and sends it to a Slack webhook via a curl command embedded in os.system. The webhook URL is hardcoded, exposing the potential for data exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious actions like damaging files, executing reverse shells, or mining cryptocurrencies. However, the collection and external transmission of system info without user awareness suggests privacy violation. The code appears to be designed for covert data collection during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious because it collects detailed system information and transmits it to an external server without user consent, indicating potential privacy abuse. The hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration behavior elevate its risk profile. While it does not perform destructive actions, its stealthy data collection and transmission are concerning and may be malicious.",
