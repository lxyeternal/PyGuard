  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior due to covert data exfiltration during installation, raising privacy and security concerns. While not containing malicious payloads or destructive actions, its intent to secretly transmit system info justifies high security risk. The malware score should be moderate, acknowledging the privacy invasion without classifying it as active malware."
