  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports show that most code is benign, with Reports 2 and 4 indicating moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The current scores are justified; minor adjustments to malware scores (to 0.5) for Reports 2 and 4 could improve caution. Overall, the supply chain risk appears moderate, with no definitive malicious payloads confirmed."
