      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with complex calculations and dynamic attribute access, designed to hide malicious activities such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, and manipulating system files. It reads environment variables and system paths, possibly to leak data or escalate privileges. The overall malware score should be set to 1 due to the malicious intent and system manipulation observed."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed reports show that most code is benign, with Reports 2 and 4 indicating moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The current scores are justified; minor adjustments to malware scores (to 0.5) for Reports 2 and 4 could improve caution. Overall, the supply chain risk appears moderate, with no definitive malicious payloads confirmed."
