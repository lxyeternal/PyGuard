  "malware": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "securityRisk": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, likely for malicious purposes such as backdoor access or payload delivery.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "PowerShell command execution, system shell invocation.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' -> if absent, run encoded PowerShell command -> proceed with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent exception handling, suspicious package name 'libintelkillvm', author 'EsqueleSquad'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell payload if the check fails. The payload is base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation typical of malicious scripts. The silent error handling conceals failures, and the package metadata suggests malicious intent. The high obfuscation and execution of hidden commands during setup are strong indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains clear malicious indicators, including obfuscated payload execution during installation, suspicious naming, and stealthy behavior. The assigned high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified and reflect the high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
