  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to embedded, obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands, which are common in malware. The package should be flagged for further decoding and analysis before use. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify high malware and risk scores. Overall, the code is likely malicious or at least malicious-sounding, warranting caution."
