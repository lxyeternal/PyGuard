{
  "purpose": "The code appears to download and execute potentially malicious files, possibly for persistence and execution of malware.",
  "sources": [
    "urllib.request.urlopen(url) - downloads external files from specified URLs",
    "os.getenv('APPDATA') - retrieves environment variable for file paths",
    "subprocess.call() and subprocess.check_output() - execute downloaded files and verify Java version"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "open(filepath, 'wb') - writes downloaded files to disk",
    "subprocess.call([filepath]) - executes the downloaded executable",
    "subprocess.call(['java', '-jar', filepath]) - runs a downloaded JAR file",
    "writes files directly into Startup folder - persistence mechanism"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Download executable from https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/neu2.exe, save to APPDATA, execute",
    "Check Java version; if present, download additional malicious JAR from https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/dcbot, save in startup, execute on startup"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing files from untrusted external URLs",
    "Saving a file into the Startup folder to ensure persistence",
    "Conditional execution based on Java presence suggests command and control activity or payload deployment",
    "No user input involved, directly executing downloaded code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by downloading an executable from an external URL and executes it immediately, indicating potential malicious intent. It then checks if Java is installed by attempting to run 'java -version'. If Java is detected, it downloads a JAR file from another external URL, saves it in the startup folder for persistence, and executes it via Java. The use of external URLs, persistent storage in startup, and execution of downloaded binaries strongly suggest malicious behavior, potentially for backdoor access, malware deployment, or other malicious activities. The code operates stealthily, with no user interaction, and leverages environment variables to hide its activities.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates high malicious intent, including downloading and executing potentially harmful files, persistence setup, and environment checks. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malware.",
