{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' and, if absent, executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, likely to perform malicious actions such as remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of a Base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which can run arbitrary code or download malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' -> if not exists, silently execute encoded PowerShell command -> setup() runs regardless.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently with creation flags for stealth; presence of comment referencing suspicious domain; silent try-except blocks hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a conditional check for 'tahg'. If missing, it executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, which is obfuscated and designed to run silently. The comment referencing 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the encoded payload suggest malicious intent. Silent error handling conceals failures, and the package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload. The obfuscation and stealth execution indicate high malicious potential. The code's behavior aligns with common tactics for stealthy remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, with silent execution and references to malicious domains. It strongly indicates malicious activity, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The package should be considered compromised or malicious.",
