{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for managing Windows console properties such as text attributes, cursor position, and buffer info using ctypes to access Windows API functions.",
  "sources": "Imports ctypes and wintypes, calls Windows API functions such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console display and properties which could potentially be misused to alter terminal behavior, but no untrusted data input or exfiltration is present.",
  "flows": "The code interacts with Windows console handles to read or modify console states, but there are no flows involving untrusted input leading to dangerous actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. Functions are straightforward wrappers around Windows API calls. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to interact with Windows console using ctypes. It sets up necessary API call parameters and handles console info retrieval and modification. No external input processing, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The purpose appears to be purely for console management, with safe API usage. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module for Windows console management. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It simply wraps Windows API calls for console operations. No security risks are evident from this review.",
