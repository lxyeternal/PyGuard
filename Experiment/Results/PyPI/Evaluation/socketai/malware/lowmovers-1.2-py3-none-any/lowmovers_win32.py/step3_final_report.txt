{
  "purpose": "The code provides Windows console API wrappers for manipulating console output, such as setting text attributes, cursor position, and console title.",
  "sources": "Functions that read input handles (_GetStdHandle), and functions that retrieve console info (_GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code mainly calls Windows API functions without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions wrapping Windows console API calls for console management tasks. It includes standard API calls with proper argument and return type definitions. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions are designed solely for console manipulation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any insecure operations. The overall structure and purpose indicate benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.0 to 0.1). The existing scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment for the last report's risk score to reflect minimal risk.",
