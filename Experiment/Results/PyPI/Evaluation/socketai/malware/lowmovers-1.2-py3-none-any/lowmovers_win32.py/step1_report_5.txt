{
  "purpose": "The code provides Windows console handling functionalities, including reading console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor positions, and console title, primarily for use in Windows command-line applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input/output handles from Windows API (_GetStdHandle), and console buffer information via _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo. No external user input or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Uses Windows API functions (_SetConsoleTextAttribute, _SetConsoleCursorPosition, _SetConsoleTitleW, etc.) to modify console display and title. These are internal API calls, not typical security-sensitive sinks like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No evident flow of untrusted or external data into sinks. Functions mostly operate on handles and internal data structures. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains detailed Windows console management functions; however, no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears standard and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is a Windows-specific console management library that uses ctypes to interface with Windows API functions for console handling. It initializes handle retrieval and provides utility functions for console buffer info, text attribute modification, cursor positioning, and title setting. The code includes conditional imports and error handling for non-Windows environments. No external data input, network operations, or cryptic obfuscation present. The functions do not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration, nor do they contain hidden backdoors or payloads. The use of Windows API functions appears straightforward and solely for console UI management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console handling utility library with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external network or file operations, nor does it handle untrusted data or secrets. The overall security risk is minimal.",
