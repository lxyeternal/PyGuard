  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with Windows console APIs for manipulating console output, such as changing text attributes, cursor position, screen buffer info, and console title.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and windll to load Windows API functions; reads system handle information and console configurations.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode which affect console display and behavior.",
  "flows": "The functions obtain console handles (source), perform operations like changing text attributes or cursor position, or retrieving console info (sink), using the handle (source) with API calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard Windows API interaction for console control; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be utility functions for console manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of functions wrapping Windows API calls related to console operations. It includes conditionally importing and defining functions based on the environment, and provides utility functions for console info, text attributes, cursor position, screen buffer, and title. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. There are no external data inputs, nor are there any sinks that transmit data or perform harmful actions. The code is benign, aimed at managing console output on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of utility functions for Windows console manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use in applications that require console control.",
