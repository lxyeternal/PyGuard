{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for interacting with Windows console APIs, including retrieving and setting console buffer info, cursor position, text attributes, console title, and console mode. It is intended for managing console display and behavior on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and ctypes.wintypes; functions that retrieve handle information (_GetStdHandle); functions that read console buffer info (_GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo); and functions that set console attributes (e.g., SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode).",
  "sinks": "Functions that manipulate console display properties, potentially affecting terminal output (e.g., SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute). These are primarily intended for formatting and controlling terminal display, not for data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data from user or environment (via console handle) flows into handle-based API calls that read or modify console state. No data flows from these functions to external systems or network resources; they are used locally for console management.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard wrapper around Windows console APIs with no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual logic. It includes a fallback for non-Windows systems, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward and well-structured interface for Windows console API interactions. It includes conditional imports, proper argument and return type definitions, and functions for common console operations. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions mainly serve to modify console display and retrieve console status. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the code does not perform any operations that could harm or compromise system security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate wrapper for Windows console API functions, aimed at managing console appearance and behavior. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no backdoors, and no signs of supply chain attacks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate console management purposes.",
