  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.0 to 0.1). The existing scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment for the last report's risk score to reflect minimal risk."
