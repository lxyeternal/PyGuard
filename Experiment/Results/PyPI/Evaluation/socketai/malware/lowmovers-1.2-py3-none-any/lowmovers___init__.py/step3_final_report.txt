{
  "purpose": "The code is heavily obfuscated, performing complex calculations, dynamic imports, and executing code via 'exec' and 'eval', likely designed to load and run malicious payloads or concealed code.",
  "sources": "Input code '__code__', global variables, obfuscated string literals, dynamic import statements, and external file operations with obfuscated filenames.",
  "sinks": "'exec', 'eval', dynamic file read/write, global state modifications, and indirect code execution via obfuscated lambda functions.",
  "flows": "Data from '__code__' and obfuscated strings flow into 'exec' and 'eval' calls, with dynamic import and file operations loading and executing external or concealed code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with string encoding, convoluted lambda functions, dynamic attribute access, suppressed exceptions, and complex control flow designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation techniques such as string encoding, dynamic import via 'globals()', and indirect execution through 'exec' and 'eval'. It loads external files with obfuscated filenames, executes arbitrary code, and suppresses errors to evade detection. The structure and behavior are consistent with malware aimed at code injection, payload loading, or data exfiltration. The use of large constants and convoluted logic appears solely to obfuscate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and exhibits clear malicious traits, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and external payload loading. It should be classified as malware with maximum security concern.",
