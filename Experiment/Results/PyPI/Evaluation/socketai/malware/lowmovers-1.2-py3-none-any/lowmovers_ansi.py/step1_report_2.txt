{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Defines static ANSI codes and functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions return strings that contain escape sequences which can affect terminal output, but do not execute or inject code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions are formatted into escape sequences, which are returned as strings; no external data or untrusted inputs are used to influence execution beyond string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of dynamic code execution, external network connections, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of ANSI escape sequence generators for terminal styling. It defines constants, functions, and classes to produce escape codes based on input parameters. The class AnsiCodes dynamically converts class attributes into escape sequences upon instantiation, which is a standard pattern for such utilities. No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code appears to be a clean utility library without malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks are present.",
