{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for coloring and cursor control in terminal outputs.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading functions; uses class attributes and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is sent to external systems or written to files directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining constants and simple functions for ANSI codes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The module defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and classes to generate control codes for colors, styles, and cursor movements. The functions simply return escape sequences based on input parameters. The class constructors convert class attribute integers into escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard behavior. No data input, external communication, or complex logic that could be exploited for malicious purposes is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library for terminal styling using ANSI codes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code performs static mappings and simple string concatenations, which are safe.",
