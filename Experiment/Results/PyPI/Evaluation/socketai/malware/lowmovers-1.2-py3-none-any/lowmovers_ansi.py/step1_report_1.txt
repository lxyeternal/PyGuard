{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor movements, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output to untrusted sources are implemented within this code; it only returns escape sequences.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; functions generate escape sequences based on parameters without external data input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The module defines constants and functions to produce ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and cursor control. Classes AnsiCodes, AnsiFore, AnsiBack, and AnsiStyle encapsulate color and style codes, initializing instance attributes with formatted escape sequences. No external input handling, no network communication, and no suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code is static, well-structured, and intended solely for terminal styling purposes. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears standard and safe, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
