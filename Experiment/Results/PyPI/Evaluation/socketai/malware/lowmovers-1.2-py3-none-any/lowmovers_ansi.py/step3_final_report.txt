{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for generating ANSI escape sequences to style terminal output, including colors, styles, cursor movements, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "The functions and class initializations generate escape sequences based on static class attributes or input parameters; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequences are returned as strings; no untrusted data or external data flows into or out of the code, nor are there sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that produce escape sequence strings; these strings are intended for terminal output but do not interact with external systems or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and static, serving as a terminal styling utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, functions, and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The classes initialize instance attributes with escape sequences based on class attributes, which is standard for such utilities. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is well-structured, static, and purpose-specific, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate, aligning with the code's benign nature.",
