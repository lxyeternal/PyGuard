  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal coloring and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines constants and functions for terminal control sequences.",
  "sinks": "The functions return ANSI escape sequences that can be sent to a terminal for visual effects.",
  "flows": "Functions generate escape sequences based on input parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for terminal control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for colors, styles, and cursor movements. It uses simple string concatenation based on input parameters or predefined class attributes. No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are detected. The purpose is purely to facilitate terminal display styling. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of ANSI escape sequence generation for terminal styling. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is a benign utility module for terminal output styling.",
