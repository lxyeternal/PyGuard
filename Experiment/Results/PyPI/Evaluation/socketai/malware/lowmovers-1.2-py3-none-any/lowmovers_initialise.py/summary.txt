  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing ANSI escape sequences on terminals, especially Windows. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects the code's utility nature without vulnerabilities."
