      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, indicating malicious intent. The package appears legitimate but is used as a vector for covert malicious activity. The silent error handling and encoded command strongly suggest malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated with suspicion until further decoding and analysis of the payload are performed."
