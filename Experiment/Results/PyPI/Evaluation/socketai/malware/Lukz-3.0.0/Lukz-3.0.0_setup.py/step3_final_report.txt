  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'Lukz' Python package. It is intended for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields within the setup() function, including name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code is static configuration; no data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'url' and 'license' fields, and 'description' containing an email address instead of a descriptive text. These are likely placeholders or misconfigurations, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward setup script with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The anomalies are superficial and do not impact security. Dependencies are standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not read untrusted input, execute external code, or perform network operations. The metadata issues are typical placeholders and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, static configuration script with minor metadata anomalies. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The anomalies are superficial and do not compromise security.",
