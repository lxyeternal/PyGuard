  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'Lukz', specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static values for package name, version, author info, dependencies; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code executes or processes untrusted data, only static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Description field contains an email address rather than a typical description; license and URL are empty. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code or handling user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The email in the description field is unusual but not malicious. No security risks are evident from this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner.",
