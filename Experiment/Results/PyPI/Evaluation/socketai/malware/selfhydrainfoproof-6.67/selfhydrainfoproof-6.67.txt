      "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, likely malicious payload executed via obfuscated PowerShell when 'tahg' does not exist. The obfuscation, silent execution, and external URL strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores in the reports are justified; the package should be treated as malicious pending further payload decoding and analysis."
