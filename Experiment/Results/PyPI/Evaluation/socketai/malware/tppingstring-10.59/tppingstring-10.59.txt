      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, which strongly suggests malicious activity. The silent execution and obfuscation are typical of malicious payloads used in supply chain attacks. The high scores reflect the significant security risk. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence warrants treating this as a high-risk, potentially malicious package."
