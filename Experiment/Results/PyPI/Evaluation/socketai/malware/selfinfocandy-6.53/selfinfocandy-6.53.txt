      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious indicators, notably the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and suspicious URL comment strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent and justified; the package should be flagged for further investigation and caution."
