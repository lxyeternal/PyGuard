{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that sends system information to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() flows into the requests.get call, which transmits this data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and potentially malicious. The code executes during the package installation without user consent, and the URL is obfuscated or placeholder-like. The data collection and transmission are hidden within the install process, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers system information (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation. The external URL is suspicious, likely used for data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not sanitize or warn about this action, indicating potential malicious intent. There are no other suspicious or malicious code elements such as backdoors or data theft mechanisms beyond this data exfiltration attempt.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it secretly collects system info and exfiltrates it during installation, which is highly suspicious. It likely aims to track or spy on users without consent. This behavior warrants a high security risk score.",
