  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username flows into the requests.get call, sending system info to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The request is sent to a suspicious, non-descriptive domain; no clear reason for this data exfiltration is provided. The code runs custom commands during install without user awareness. No validation or user consent is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools install command to perform additional actions during package installation. It gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. These are then sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The URL used appears obfuscated and untrusted, which could indicate malicious intent or data exfiltration. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident. The behavior resembles a potential supply chain attack, aiming to harvest system data during package installation. There is no apparent benign purpose for this network request, and the domain is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a suspicious external domain during package installation. This behavior is likely malicious or at least highly suspicious, representing a security risk.",
