{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup with a custom installation step that sends system information to a specified URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from environment and system calls.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits collected data to an external URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username flows from source variables into the requests.get() call as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a network request to a hardcoded external URL during installation, which is suspicious. The URL appears obfuscated or placeholder-like. No authentication or validation is performed before sending data. The code structure is straightforward but includes behavior that could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, upon installation, gathers system info (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior is unusual for a typical package and suggests possible tracking, data collection, or malicious activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are present. The URL used is not a common package repository and appears to be a placeholder or intentionally obfuscated. The data collection occurs automatically during installation without user consent or notification, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains behavior that can be classified as malicious or maliciously motivated, specifically data exfiltration during package installation. The intent appears to be tracking or monitoring system environments without user awareness. While technically simple, this behavior is suspicious and should be considered a security risk.",
