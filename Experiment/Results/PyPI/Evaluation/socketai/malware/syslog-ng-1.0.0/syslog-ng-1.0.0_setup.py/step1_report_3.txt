{
  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process of a Python package, including collecting system information and sending it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (hostname, current working directory, username); making an HTTP GET request to a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the external URL with system data as parameters.",
  "flows": "On execution of 'run', system info is collected and immediately sent via requests.get to the specified domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system details (hostname, cwd, username) to a remote server without user consent, which is suspicious. The target URL appears obfuscated and potentially malicious. No validation or encryption of data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the 'install' command to execute additional actions during package installation. It gathers system info (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external, obfuscated domain. This behavior resembles a potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. The URL is hidden, suggesting malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. No user notification or consent is involved, which raises concerns. The use of 'requests' for such a purpose during installation is atypical and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and transmits it to an external domain without user knowledge, indicating malicious behavior or at least a privacy violation. The obfuscated URL and unsolicited data transmission during package install are red flags.",
