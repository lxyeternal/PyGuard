{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrate this data to a remote server without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL with collected data as parameters",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data stored in 'ploads' -> requests.get() to remote URL with 'ploads' as parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user notification, hardcoded suspicious URL, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute a network request during package installation, collecting system info and sending it to a suspicious URL. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and performs a malicious activity (data exfiltration). The URL appears to be a test or placeholder domain. The activity is unauthorized and constitutes malicious behavior. The code lacks user consent prompts or notifications, further indicating malicious intent. The data flow is direct and simple, with no obfuscation or hidden mechanisms. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns involving stealthy data collection during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, with no obfuscation and a suspicious URL. It poses a high security risk and should be considered malware. The activity is straightforward and clearly malicious, with no benign purpose.",
