{
  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the system.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to a remote server, acting as a network sink.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info from gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() and then transmits it via requests.get() to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system data to an external server during installation, which is not typical for a setup script and suggests potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and overrides the install command to execute additional code after the normal installation process. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration often seen in malicious packages. No other obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present; the behavior is straightforward but malicious in intent. The remote URL is hardcoded and suspicious, indicating potential tracking or spying activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious because it secretly collects system information during installation and sends it to an external server without user consent. This is a clear violation of security best practices and indicates malicious intent.",
