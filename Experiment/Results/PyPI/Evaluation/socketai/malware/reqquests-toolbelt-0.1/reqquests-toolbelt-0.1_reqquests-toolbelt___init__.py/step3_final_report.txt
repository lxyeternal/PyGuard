  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, or external files; code reads data via functions like eval(), exec(), or environment access.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to dynamic execution functions, network connections, or hardcoded secrets, risking data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input feed into eval()/exec() or network functions; flows from these sources to sinks indicate potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, inconsistent formatting, or suspicious function usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, especially in reports 3 and 5. Report 5 contains hardcoded secrets and eval(), indicating high suspicion. Report 3 shows obfuscation and dynamic code but no confirmed payloads. Reports 1, 2, and 4 lack suspicious features, with minimal or benign code. The scores in the original reports are generally aligned, but the malware scores for reports 3 and 5 should be increased to reflect the red flags. Specifically, report 3's malware score should be adjusted from 0.2 to 0.4, and report 5's from 0.4 to 0.6, to better represent the suspicion level. Obfuscation scores are justified as high in reports 3 and 5, and moderate in report 5. Security risks are also justified as high in report 5 due to multiple indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are correctly scored, but reports 3 and 5 should have their malware scores increased to better reflect the suspicious patterns. The overall assessment indicates moderate to high risk primarily in report 5, with obfuscation and dynamic code execution as key indicators. The adjusted scores provide a more accurate risk representation based on the described code features.",
