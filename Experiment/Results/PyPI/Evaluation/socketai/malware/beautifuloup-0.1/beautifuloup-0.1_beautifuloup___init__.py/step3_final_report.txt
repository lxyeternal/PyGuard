  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (`eval`/`exec`), hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscated code, input handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or dynamic execution flow into network activity, data handling, or environment manipulation sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, complex or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align with their scoring. Benign reports (1, 3, 4) show no suspicious patterns, consistent with low malware and risk scores. Suspicious reports (2, 5) identify obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying higher scores. Report 2's malware score (0.3) could be slightly increased to 0.4 to better reflect the suspicious features, but remains acceptable. Report 5's high scores are justified by multiple indicators of malicious intent. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the behaviors described, with minor room for adjustment in report 2.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and security risk scores. Reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution are appropriately scored, with a recommended slight increase in report 2's malware score from 0.3 to 0.4. High suspicion in report 5 warrants continued caution. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.",
