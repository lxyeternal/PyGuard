  "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated with clear signs of malicious intent, including system modifications, package management, and privilege escalation. Its complexity and concealment tactics strongly suggest it is malicious or sabotage code that could compromise system integrity. Deployment or execution should be strictly avoided until thorough deobfuscation and security review are performed."
