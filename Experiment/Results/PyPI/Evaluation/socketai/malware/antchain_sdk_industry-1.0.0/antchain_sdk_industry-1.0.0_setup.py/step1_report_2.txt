{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'antchain_sdk_industry' package, with a custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment; makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sinks": "Requests made to external URL with system information; potential data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source to the request URL as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request in the custom install class that sends system info to an external server without user consent, which is unusual for a package setup script. The URL used (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) suggests a connection to a known security testing or data collection domain.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and extends the install command to include an HTTP request that transmits environment details. No user input is sanitized or validated, and the network request occurs automatically during installation, which is suspicious. The URL indicates it may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but intentionally leaks environment info. The practice of sending environment details during setup is not standard and raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior of exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, which can be considered malicious. It appears designed to track or collect data stealthily. The overall security risk is high due to the potential for unauthorized data collection.",
