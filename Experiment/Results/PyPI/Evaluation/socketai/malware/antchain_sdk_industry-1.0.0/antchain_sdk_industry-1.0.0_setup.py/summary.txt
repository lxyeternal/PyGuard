  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior. The external URL and the data transmission without user consent confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting high malware potential and security risk. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this is a high-severity supply chain security issue involving covert data collection."
