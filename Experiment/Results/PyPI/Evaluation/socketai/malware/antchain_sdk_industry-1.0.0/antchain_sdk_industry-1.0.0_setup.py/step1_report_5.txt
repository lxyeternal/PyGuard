{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom installation command that gathers system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser() - reading system info; requests.get() - external network request.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external server with system info as parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, current working directory, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information without user consent during package installation, which can be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The URL appears suspicious and is used without explanation or user knowledge.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and other modules, then defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run method. In this method, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially since it occurs automatically during package installation without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and not a common trusted endpoint. The code does not perform any other malicious activity such as system modification or malware delivery but acts covertly to collect and transmit system information.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user awareness. It appears to be designed for tracking or gathering system data maliciously. The use of a suspicious external URL and automatic data transmission during setup are concerning.",
