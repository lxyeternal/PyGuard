{
  "purpose": "Define and install the 'antchain_sdk_industry' Python package while executing custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits collected data (hostname, current working directory, username) to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and then sent via HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system information and exfiltrates it without user consent. The URL used ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') indicates data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom install class that, during installation, gathers system details such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this information to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior occurs automatically upon package installation without explicit user awareness or consent. The code appears to be designed for stealthy data collection, which is suspicious. The use of a third-party domain for data transmission suggests potential malicious intent, such as system reconnaissance or data exfiltration, typical in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. This indicates a supply chain attack or malicious package designed to harvest user data without consent. It demonstrates high malicious intent and poses a significant security threat.",
