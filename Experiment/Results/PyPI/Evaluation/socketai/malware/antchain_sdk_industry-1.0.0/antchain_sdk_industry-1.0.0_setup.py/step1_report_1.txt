  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that exfiltrates system information.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to exfiltrate data to external server",
  "flows": "Gather system info (hostname, cwd, username) -> send via requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class that performs data exfiltration during package installation; external network request to suspicious domain",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setup process with a CustomInstall class that, during installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a third-party server '5r13v9.ceye.io', which appears to be used for data collection or command-and-control. This behavior is unusual for typical setup scripts and indicates potential malicious activity aimed at collecting system information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior. It is likely intended for tracking or reconnaissance, and could be used as a backdoor or malicious tool within a supply chain attack.",
