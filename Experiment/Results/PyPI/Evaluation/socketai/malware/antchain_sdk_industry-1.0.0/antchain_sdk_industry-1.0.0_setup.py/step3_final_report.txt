{
  "purpose": "The code performs a custom installation step that collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",

  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that, during installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is abnormal for a setup script and indicates covert data exfiltration. The external URL appears suspicious, suggesting malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs a network request during installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The behavior is clearly malicious, aimed at reconnaissance or backdoor access. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified given the malicious exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior. The external URL and the data transmission without user consent confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting high malware potential and security risk. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this is a high-severity supply chain security issue involving covert data collection.",
