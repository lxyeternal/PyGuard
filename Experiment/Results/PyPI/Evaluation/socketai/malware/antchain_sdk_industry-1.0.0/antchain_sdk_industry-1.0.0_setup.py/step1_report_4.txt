{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to collect system information and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, and username flows into the requests.get() call, transmitting data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a custom install class to exfiltrate system info without user consent; no validation or encryption of data; hardcoded external URL; no apparent user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code leverages setuptools for package installation. It extends the install process to gather system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical installation procedures, it performs an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL, transmitting the collected data as URL parameters. This behavior suggests data exfiltration without user knowledge or consent, which is suspicious. The URL appears to be a testing or demonstration domain, but its use in this context indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present; the code is straightforward but malicious in purpose due to covert data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system data during package installation without user consent, representing a security risk. It should be considered malicious or backdoored code.",
