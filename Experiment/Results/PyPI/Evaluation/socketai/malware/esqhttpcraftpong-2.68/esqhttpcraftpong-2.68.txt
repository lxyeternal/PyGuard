      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, likely for malicious purposes such as remote control or data theft. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL justify a high malware and risk score. The package should be considered malicious until decoded and verified. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics, and the scores reflect a significant threat."
