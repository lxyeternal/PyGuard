  "purpose": "Custom installation command that sends system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), import of discord, aiohttp, asyncio",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() to external Discord URL with system information",
  "flows": "Code reads hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this data to an external Discord webhook during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Code performs network activity (sending system info) during install, uses asynchronous call within install script, hardcoded webhook URL",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to import system and Discord-related modules. It retrieves hostname and IP address and asynchronously posts this information to a Discord webhook URL, potentially without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating intent to exfiltrate system data. This operation occurs during package installation, which can be hidden from the user. No other malicious activity such as code execution, data theft, or system damage is observed. The code uses asyncio to perform network activity, which is unusual for install scripts but not inherently malicious. Overall, the primary concern is covert data exfiltration during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly sending system information to an external server during installation. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the activity occurs transparently during install, indicating malicious intent.",
