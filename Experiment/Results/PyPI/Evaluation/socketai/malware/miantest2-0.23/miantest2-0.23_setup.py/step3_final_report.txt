{
  "purpose": "The code executes during package installation, retrieves system hostname and IP address, and sends this information covertly to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL using asynchronous network requests.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "aiohttp.ClientSession() sending data to the hardcoded webhook URL",
  "flows": "source (hostname/IP) -> async function 'foo()' -> webhook POST request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Network request during setup, use of asyncio.run() in setup script, hardcoded webhook URL, import of discord.py and aiohttp during install",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by sending system hostname and IP address to an external server during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The use of asyncio.run() within the setup process and a hardcoded webhook URL indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward without obfuscation, but the behavior constitutes privacy invasion and potential malicious tracking. The high suspicion is supported by the network activity occurring automatically during install, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. The behavior is consistent with supply chain sabotage or malicious package behavior, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
