  "purpose": "Custom installation process that sends system hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), and the embedded Discord webhook URL within the async function.",
  "sinks": "Sending data to the Discord webhook URL via aiohttp.ClientSession, which transmits system info over the network.",
  "flows": "Code reads hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this data to the specified Discord webhook during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of executing network code during package installation; hardcoded webhook URL; no user consent; uses asyncio within install command.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the setuptools install process to include an asynchronous function that sends the system's hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook. It imports multiple modules, including discord and aiohttp, then immediately runs the async function in the run method of a custom install class. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which could be used for exfiltration or tracking without user knowledge. The presence of network activity and hardcoded webhook raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation, which is highly suspicious. The inclusion of network activity in a setup script indicates potential malware use or privacy violation. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
