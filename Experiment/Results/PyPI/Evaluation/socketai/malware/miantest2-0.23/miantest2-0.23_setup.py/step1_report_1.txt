  "purpose": "Custom installation process that, during setup, sends hostname and IP address to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() via discord Webhook, network request to Discord webhook URL",
  "flows": "hostname and IP address are obtained from socket functions, then sent asynchronously to a Discord webhook URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "Execution of network communication during setup, hardcoded webhook URL, use of asyncio.run() within a setup script, import of discord and aiohttp during installation process",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, including discord, aiohttp, and asyncio, within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method. It gathers system hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this data to a specified Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it leaks system information without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating possible malicious intent. The code does not validate or sanitize data, and the network activity during install could be exploited for data exfiltration or malicious tracking. No other suspicious code, such as backdoors or credential theft, is observed outside this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by sending system information to an external Discord webhook during installation. This constitutes a security risk and could be used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration or user tracking. The webhook URL's presence confirms intentional data leakage. This package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
