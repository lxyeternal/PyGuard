  "purpose": "Custom installation process that sends system information via a Discord webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), import discord, import aiohttp",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() via Discord API with system hostname and IP address",
  "flows": "hostname/IP address obtained -> webhook URL accessed -> asynchronously sends hostname and IP to Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network request during installation, which is unusual for package setup scripts. Hardcoded webhook URL potentially exfiltrates system info. Use of asyncio within setup command is uncommon.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when run, imports various network and Discord libraries, then immediately gathers system hostname and IP address. It then asynchronously sends this data to a specific Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is atypical and suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL and network activity during installation constitutes malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. No other malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The overall behavior suggests an attempt to spy on or collect system info surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by sending system information to an external server during package installation. It is highly suspicious and potentially harmful, constituting a security risk. The webhook URL hardcoded in the script is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
