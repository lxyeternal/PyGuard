{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package 'libcpu' and conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command when the directory 'tahg' does not exist, likely for malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess in a hidden window",
  "flows": "Filesystem check leads to execution of the encoded command; no further data flows are evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently with hidden window flags; broad try-except blocks suppress errors; no decoding or transparency of payload",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but contains a conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command when 'tahg' is missing. The command is encoded in Base64 and run with stealth flags, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The broad exception handling may hide errors, including malicious failures. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscation ~0.9, risk ~0.8) are justified given the stealthy, obfuscated execution. Without decoding the payload, certainty about malicious intent remains limited, but the behavior aligns with common malicious tactics such as payload download, backdoor setup, or data exfiltration. The setup function itself appears benign. Overall, the code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to stealthy, obfuscated command execution, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, indicative of malicious intent. The setup process is benign, but the stealthy command execution justifies a malware score of approximately 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk around 0.85. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions.",
