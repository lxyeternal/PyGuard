      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, indicative of malicious intent. The setup process is benign, but the stealthy command execution justifies a malware score of approximately 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk around 0.85. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions."
