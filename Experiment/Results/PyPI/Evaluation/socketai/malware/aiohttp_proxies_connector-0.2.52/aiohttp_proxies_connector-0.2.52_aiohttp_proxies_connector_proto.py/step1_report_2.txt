{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous socket wrappers for connecting through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, supporting authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (host, port, username, password), socket data via network I/O, and address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Sends data through socket connections, including proxy negotiation commands and authentication data; receives responses from the proxy server.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are used to construct requests; data flows from these inputs to socket send/receive functions, potentially leading to proxy communication and address resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard proxy negotiation, address resolution, and socket management. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy client behavior with asynchronous socket handling, including proper error handling for connection issues, address resolution, and proxy negotiation. No malicious logic such as unauthorized data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The usage of address resolution and socket communication appears legitimate and in line with proxy protocols. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs beyond standard proxy client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SOCKS proxy client implementation for Python, handling proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection setup without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious activity or malicious behaviors are detected.",
