{
  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio, enabling asynchronous proxy connections with proper error handling and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy and destination addresses, socket connection functions, address resolution via getaddrinfo, and data sent/received over sockets.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive operations that handle untrusted data, especially in address resolution and proxy negotiation steps.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames/IPs) are resolved, then used to construct protocol-specific requests, which are sent over the socket; responses are received and parsed to establish proxy connection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Protocol adherence appears correct. No backdoors or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients with proper error handling, address resolution, and protocol negotiation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of socket operations and data handling aligns with typical implementations. No hardcoded credentials or covert channels are observed. The error handling and exception raising are appropriate, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risks, primarily inherent to proxy credential handling, which is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.15, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
