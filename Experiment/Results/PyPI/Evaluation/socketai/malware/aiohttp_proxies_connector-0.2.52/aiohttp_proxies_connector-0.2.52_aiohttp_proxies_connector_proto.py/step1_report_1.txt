{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, allowing connections through proxy servers with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include host and port parameters, environment variables (indirectly through socket resolution), and user credentials (username and password). Data read occurs primarily during socket communication and DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to and received from proxy servers over network sockets. Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is mishandled, but the code appears to correctly process and send data for proxy negotiation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (host, port, credentials) to socket resolution, then through the SOCKS negotiation process involving sending and receiving structured protocol messages, culminating in establishing a proxied connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code uses standard socket operations, with proper exception handling. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. Import statements are straightforward and relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy negotiation protocols for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. It handles socket creation, connection, DNS resolution, and protocol exchanges appropriately. The code includes error handling for connection issues and invalid responses. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are found. The structure is clear and adheres to standard network programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without malicious intent. It performs standard proxy connection setup with proper error handling. No security risks or malware indications are identified. It is safe based on this analysis.",
