  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS4/SOCKS5 implementation with no malicious intent. It highlights proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is a straightforward implementation of known protocols, no malware or obfuscation is present. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, perhaps due to potential misuse if credentials are mishandled, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard behavior, proper socket handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, describes standard SOCKS proxy wrappers with proper handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation, low risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar positive evaluation, emphasizing correct implementation and no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, noting standard implementation, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical SOCKS proxy client with no malicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to potential misuse (e.g., credential handling), but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the nature of proxy code which could be misused if credentials are mishandled, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified in their scoring. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious or obfuscated features.",
