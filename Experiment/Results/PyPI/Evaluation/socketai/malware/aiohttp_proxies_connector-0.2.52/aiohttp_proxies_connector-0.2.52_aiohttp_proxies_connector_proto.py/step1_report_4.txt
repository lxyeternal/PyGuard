{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket connections, supporting authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, port numbers, and user credentials (for authentication). Data is read from socket connections during negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into socket send/recv operations, especially during negotiate, _build_dest_address, and _socks_auth methods. Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted inputs are mishandled or if sensitive credentials are sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication steps. Data flows out during socket communication, especially in _send and _receive methods. Address resolution results flow into connection setup. The data from the host/port inputs can flow through to socket communication with the proxy.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code properly handles errors and exceptions. No hidden backdoors or malicious code are evident. The code performs standard proxy negotiation steps. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection procedures using asyncio for non-blocking operations. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment according to protocol specifications. Error handling is present for common failure points such as connection issues, version mismatches, and authentication failures. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as covert data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, are identified. Usage of socket functions and data flow is consistent with proxy client behavior. The code appears legitimate and aligns with common proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy clients with support for authentication and address resolution. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for proxy connections without hidden or harmful features.",
