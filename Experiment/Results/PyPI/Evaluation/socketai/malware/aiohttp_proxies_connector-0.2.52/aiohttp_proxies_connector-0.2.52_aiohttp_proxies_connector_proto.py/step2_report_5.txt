  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy clients, with proper error handling, no suspicious behaviors, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — somewhat cautious but acceptable given the proxy functionality.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — matches the straightforward code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues detected. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard behavior, no malicious activity, and proper handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — low, considering the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities identified. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with proper exception handling and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, secure implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical, well-structured SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting general caution but not indicating real threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the given scores. The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities that would justify higher risk scores.\n\n**My personal assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the functionality but acknowledging potential misuse if misconfigured.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
