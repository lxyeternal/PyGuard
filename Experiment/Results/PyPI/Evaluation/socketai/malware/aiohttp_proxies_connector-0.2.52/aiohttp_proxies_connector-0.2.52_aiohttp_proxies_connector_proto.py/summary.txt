  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risks, primarily inherent to proxy credential handling, which is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.15, consistent with the detailed analysis."
