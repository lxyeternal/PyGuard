{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, enabling asynchronous connection, negotiation, and data transmission through proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, user credentials, and DNS resolution results obtained via 'getaddrinfo' and parameters passed to class constructors.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flow occurs through network socket operations such as 'sock_sendall', 'sock_recv', and 'sock_connect'. Data is sent to and received from proxies and target hosts, and credentials may be used in authentication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or hostname resolution ('host', 'port', 'username', 'password') through negotiation and authentication methods, ultimately leading to establishing a proxy connection and relaying data between client and target host.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No backdoors or suspicious behaviors are evident. It performs standard proxy connection procedures with proper exception handling. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or unauthorized actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy handling using asyncio for non-blocking socket operations. It properly manages address resolution, connection establishment, authentication, and data transmission. Exception handling is thorough, with specific error messages and custom exceptions. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden network activities, are detected. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns. It adheres to standard proxy protocols and security practices, without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers designed for asynchronous operations. It appears to be intended for proxy connectivity and data forwarding without any malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are evident. It can be considered safe based on the provided content.",
