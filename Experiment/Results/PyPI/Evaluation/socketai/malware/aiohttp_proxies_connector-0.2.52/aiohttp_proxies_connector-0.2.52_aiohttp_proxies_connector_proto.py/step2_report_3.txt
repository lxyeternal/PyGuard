  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, asynchronous SOCKS4/5 proxy client implementation with proper error handling and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the legitimate functionality and no suspicious activity.\n- **Comments:** The report is thorough, logical, and consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard SOCKS proxy client behavior with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware indicated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** Well-reasoned, consistent, no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with proper handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Comments:** Clear, logical, no suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, legitimate SOCKS proxy client.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears correct and implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden logic.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's functionality and no malicious indicators, a slightly higher but still low score (e.g., 0.1–0.2) is appropriate, which matches current scores.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given the standard nature of the implementation and proper error handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
