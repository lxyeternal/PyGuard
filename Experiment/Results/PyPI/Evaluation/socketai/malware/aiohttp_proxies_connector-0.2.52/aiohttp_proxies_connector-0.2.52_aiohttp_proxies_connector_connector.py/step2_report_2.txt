  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a custom `ProxyConnector` for `aiohttp`, supporting multiple proxy types and optional DNS resolution.\n- Constructs proxy URLs dynamically from parameters.\n- Creates socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies.\n- Uses `parse_proxy_url` to extract proxy details.\n- Manages network connections via `aiohttp` with proxy configurations.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Observations:**\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation for proxy handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- Proxy URL construction uses user-supplied data, which is typical but requires careful handling.\n- Socket creation via `create_socket_wrapper` is a point of interest, but without its implementation, it's assumed to be a standard wrapper.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic detected.\n- The code does not perform any data exfiltration, cryptomining, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior. The low security risk score aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. The reasoning and scoring are reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the lack of malicious activity. It notes potential exposure of credentials via URL, which is standard but should be handled securely.\n- **Verdict:** The score and reasoning are consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the standard nature of the code. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9**\n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as a typical proxy handler with no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified; no adjustments needed.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the standard implementation and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across reports, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting a low but non-zero risk due to handling of user-supplied data and proxy credentials.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified based on thorough reasoning.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- Clarify that the security risk could increase if user inputs are maliciously crafted, but in its current form, the code is safe.\n- Emphasize that the security depends on safe handling of inputs and the trustworthiness of `create_socket_wrapper`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low risk, standard proxy handling)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears secure, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. Proper input validation and secure handling of credentials are recommended but beyond the scope of this review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code shows no signs of malicious activity, and the scoring aligns with its benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
