  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code defines classes for custom DNS resolution and proxy connection handling.\n- Proxy URLs are dynamically constructed from parameters, including optional credentials.\n- Socket creation is wrapped via `create_socket_wrapper`, which could be a point of concern if malicious, but no details are provided.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The code appears to implement standard proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes the code as a standard proxy connector.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code appears benign, with a low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk:** The overall low risk is justified given the benign nature and lack of malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; emphasizes dynamic proxy URL construction and socket handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code's use of proxy credentials in URLs is standard, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; highlights configuration via parameters and URL parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code's socket creation and proxy handling are standard; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes the flow from proxy URL parsing to socket creation.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code is a typical proxy connector with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; emphasizes the dynamic configuration and socket handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard proxy connector; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports seems appropriate given the code's functionality and lack of malicious activity.\n\n**Potential concerns:**  \nThe only potential risk could be if `create_socket_wrapper` is malicious, but without its implementation, we can't assume so. The code relies on external functions, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard proxy handling, configurable parameters, no hardcoded secrets)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears secure, benign, and well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior and the available information.",
