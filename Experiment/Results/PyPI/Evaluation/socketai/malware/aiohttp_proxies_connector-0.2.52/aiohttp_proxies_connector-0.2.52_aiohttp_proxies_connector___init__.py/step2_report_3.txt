  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports components from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), defines a version string, and exports these via `__all__`.\n- It functions as an API interface or package initialization file.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign package setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports identify the code as a benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious content. This aligns with the actual code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent in their assessment: they recognize that the code is a straightforward import/export setup with no runtime logic or data flow.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n  - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and confidence 1.\n  - These are reasonable given the code content.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are 0. This is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since the code is purely structural and import/export, and no malicious behavior is evident, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign package interface.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard module initializer, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, data flow, or external interactions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
