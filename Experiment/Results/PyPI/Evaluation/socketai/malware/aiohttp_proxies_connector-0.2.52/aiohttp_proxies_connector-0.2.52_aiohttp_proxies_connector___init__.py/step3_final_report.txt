  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API interface for a Python SOCKS proxy client library, exposing classes, functions, and constants for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), the __version__ string, and the __all__ list defining public API.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or external data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code only defines module exports; no data flows or runtime logic are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup file with import statements and export definitions. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or API module, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
