  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and export classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections, including error handling and connection helpers.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; imports from other modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified; no external network or file operations present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code mainly imports and re-exports components without any data flow or logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; simple re-exporting of imported components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy connections and error handling, and then defines a version string and an __all__ list for module exports. It functions as a package interface or API definition, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external communication. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies in the structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface or module export file, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign package component.",
