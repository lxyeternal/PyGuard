{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define and export components related to a proxy connection library, including connectors, error classes, helper functions, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and re-exports selected classes and functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present; code appears to be standard library setup with no dynamic execution or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports and exports components for a proxy library, setting version and export list. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed or processed. No suspicious code or malicious patterns are evident. The code structure is typical for a package __init__.py file, with no apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It is a normal module initialization for a Python proxy library.",
