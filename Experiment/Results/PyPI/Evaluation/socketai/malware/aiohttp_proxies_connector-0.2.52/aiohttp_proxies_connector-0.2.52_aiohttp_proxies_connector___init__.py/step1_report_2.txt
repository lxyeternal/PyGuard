{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package for handling SOCKS proxy connections, including defining error classes, helper functions, and connection types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), likely reading module files within the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling identified in this snippet. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines imports, version, and exports; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. The code consists of standard import/export statements and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and defines the package's public interface and version. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's init file, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file for a proxy connection library. It shows no malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets up imports and exports for the package modules.",
