{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export components for a SOCKS proxy client library, including connectors, error classes, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), possibly user or external code that uses this package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; primarily module setup and export statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code only imports and re-exports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines module metadata and export lists. It functions as a module initializer or API definition for a SOCKS proxy client library. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious behaviors, or security issues within this fragment. The code structure is straightforward, and no external or untrusted data is processed here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python library related to SOCKS proxies. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
