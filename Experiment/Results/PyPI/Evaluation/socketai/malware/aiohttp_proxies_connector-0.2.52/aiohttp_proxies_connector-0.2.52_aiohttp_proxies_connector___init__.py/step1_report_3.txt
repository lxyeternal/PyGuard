  "purpose": "This source code defines module exports and imports for a proxy handling library, facilitating proxy connections with error handling and helpers.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the module version string.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. No untrusted data sources or sensitive operations evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to sensitive outputs. Imports are static. No dynamic execution or data manipulation detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, defining module-level variables (__version__, __all__), and no executable logic or data processing. No source-to-sink data flow, no input validation, or external communication is evident. All imported modules are presumably part of a legitimate package for proxy handling. The code structure and content appear standard for a Python package's init or module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain any code that could be used maliciously, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or malware indicators.",
