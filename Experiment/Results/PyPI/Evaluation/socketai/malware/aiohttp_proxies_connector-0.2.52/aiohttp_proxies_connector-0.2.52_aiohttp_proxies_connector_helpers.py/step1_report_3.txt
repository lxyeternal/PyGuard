{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs with 'parse_proxy_url'; input parameters in 'open_connection' and 'create_connection' functions; user-supplied 'socks_url', 'host', 'port'.",
  "sinks": "Connecting sockets with 'sock.connect'; creating network connections via 'asyncio.open_connection' and 'loop.create_connection'; potential data flows from input parameters to network socket operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'socks_url' or direct 'host' and 'port' flow through 'parse_proxy_url' or directly into socket creation; socket connections are established with 'connect' methods, then data is transmitted through these connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of third-party libraries (yarl, aiohttp_proxies_connector) appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows observed. Error handling is standard, raising exceptions on invalid inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical network proxy connection setup: parsing URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections asynchronously. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. Usage of input data is limited to connection setup without any evident leakage or covert channels. External library use is standard for URL parsing and socket management. No suspicious patterns or anomalous logic were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for SOCKS proxy connections with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles connection setup securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
