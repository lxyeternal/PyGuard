{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections with optional proxy authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as 'socks_url', 'host', 'port', 'username', 'password'. Parses proxy URL in 'parse_proxy_url'.",
  "sinks": "Creates socket connections and passes socket objects to 'asyncio.open_connection' and 'loop.create_connection', which then establish network communications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including proxy URL) flow into 'parse_proxy_url' and 'create_socket_wrapper', which generate socket objects. These objects connect to target servers, passing untrusted input (host, port, proxy URL) directly into socket connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It primarily handles network connection setup via proxies without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly processes inputs for establishing network connections over SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and handling proxy credentials. It does not include any hardcoded secrets, suspicious network behaviors, or malicious operations. The only potential concern is passing user-supplied data directly into socket connection functions, which is standard for network connection code and not inherently malicious. There are no indications of covert data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. Overall, this is a straightforward network utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate network connection setup via SOCKS proxies without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module for proxy-based connections, with no evidence of malware or sabotage.",
