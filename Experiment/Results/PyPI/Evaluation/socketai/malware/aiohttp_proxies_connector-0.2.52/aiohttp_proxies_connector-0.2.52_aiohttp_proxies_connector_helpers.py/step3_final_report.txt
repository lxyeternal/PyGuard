{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters (host, port, proxy URL, credentials), external libraries (yarl, aiohttp_proxies_connector).",
  "sinks": "Socket connection methods, asyncio's open_connection and create_connection functions, network sockets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL parsing and socket creation, then into connection functions which establish network connections via proxies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Proper exception handling and validation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It correctly parses proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages connections with validation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The external libraries used are common for such tasks. The input handling and exception raising are appropriate, and the overall structure is clear and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for SOCKS proxy connection setup with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It relies on user inputs and external libraries appropriately, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
