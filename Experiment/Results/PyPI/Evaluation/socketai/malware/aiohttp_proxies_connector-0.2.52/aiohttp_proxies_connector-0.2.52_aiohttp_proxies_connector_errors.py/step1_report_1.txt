  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and related errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is only class definitions",
  "anomalies": "None; the code only defines exception classes without any unusual or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. No functions, input handling, network operations, or data processing are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The classes are typical for defining specific exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward set of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions intended for use in a SOCKS proxy implementation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
