  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from standard exceptions; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are used for exception handling without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes, serving as custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy errors. There are no functions, network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and standard for error handling. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The absence of network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic confirms that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound.",
