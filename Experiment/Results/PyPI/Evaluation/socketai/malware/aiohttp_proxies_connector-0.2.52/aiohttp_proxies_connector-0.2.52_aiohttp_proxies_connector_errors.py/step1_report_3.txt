{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only class definitions for exception handling",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow since there are only exception class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes to handle SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, inheriting from built-in exceptions such as Exception, OSError, and specialized error classes. These definitions are straightforward and typical for error handling modules. There is no logic, data processing, or external interactions, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of exception class declarations for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard error handling module with no signs of malware or security issues.",
