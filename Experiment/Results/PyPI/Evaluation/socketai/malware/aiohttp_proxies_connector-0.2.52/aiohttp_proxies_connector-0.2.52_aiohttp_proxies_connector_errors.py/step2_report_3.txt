  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and purely for error handling. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes and contains no suspicious constructs.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports and the code analysis show no malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations.\n- The malware score should be 0.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, as the code is purely class definitions.\n- No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code contains only exception class definitions, with no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- No obfuscation, no external data, no network activity, and no secrets.  \n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
