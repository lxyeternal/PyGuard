  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or input/output mechanisms. No apparent malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code is straightforward and serves as a part of a larger error handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains only class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. It appears to be standard, non-malicious, and does not introduce any security risks or suspicious behavior.",
