  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes.\n   - No functions, data processing, network operations, or data input/output are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code appears to be a typical error handling framework component.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. There is no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this code is purely for exception class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are present in the reports.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are justified and align with the code content.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious constructs, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n   - The overall risk is minimal, and no changes are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The reports do not overstate the risk or suggest vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores and conclusions.",
