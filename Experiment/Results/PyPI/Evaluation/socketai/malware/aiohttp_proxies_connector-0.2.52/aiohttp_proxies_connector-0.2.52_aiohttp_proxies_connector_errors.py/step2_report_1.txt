  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions.\n   - There are no input/output operations, network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign error handling setup for a SOCKS proxy implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is only class definitions with no data flow or external interactions.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign and purely for exception handling.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this with zero scores in malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they focus on the actual code content.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n   - The high confidence (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in a Python project related to SOCKS proxy handling.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n- The uniform high confidence across reports is justified.\n\n**In conclusion, the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate based on the code content.**",
