  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, network interactions, or data processing.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exception classes, and their structure is straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard error handling module, intended for use elsewhere in a larger SOCKS proxy implementation.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**\n   - The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is reasonable.\n   - Since there is no malicious activity, no data leakage, or suspicious behavior, a low or zero risk score is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - The reports are thorough and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assigned scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain very low, as there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in the larger context, such exception classes are used properly and not exploited in other parts of the application, but based solely on this snippet, the security posture is sound.",
