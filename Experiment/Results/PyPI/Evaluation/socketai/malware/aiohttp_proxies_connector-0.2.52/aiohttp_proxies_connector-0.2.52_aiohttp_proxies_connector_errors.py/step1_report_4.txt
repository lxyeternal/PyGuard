  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads; purely class and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions and inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, primarily for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. There are no data input, output, or processing operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious code behavior present. The structure is straightforward, serving as exception hierarchy for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling with no malicious intent or security risks.",
