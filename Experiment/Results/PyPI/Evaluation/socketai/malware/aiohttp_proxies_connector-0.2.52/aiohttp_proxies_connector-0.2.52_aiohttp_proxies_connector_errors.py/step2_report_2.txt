  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or input/output handling present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions with no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports accurately describe the benign nature of the code, noting the absence of data flow, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's content. Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code is purely class definitions for exceptions; no malicious code, network activity, or data leakage is present. The malware score of 0 in all reports is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or complex constructs. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Since the code is harmless and only defines exception classes, the overall security risk should be minimal, with a score of 0. The reports' scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Potential for Hidden Risks:**  \n  The reports do not suggest any assumptions or claims about hidden malicious behavior. They correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the totality of the evidence, the code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code, consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the assessment aligns perfectly with the code's content.",
