  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "None, as this is a set of exception class definitions without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types, mainly for SOCKS proxy error handling. No input/output operations, data processing, or network activity are present. The classes are simple, standard exception inheritance structures, with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code serves as a foundation for error handling in a larger application, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only provides custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard and benign pattern used for exception handling.",
