{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a module named 'frequest', likely intended for HTTP request methods.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from 'frequest' module.",
  "sinks": "None in this code fragment; no data or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only an import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'frequest' resembling 'requests' but misspelled or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions from a non-standard module 'frequest'. No runtime behavior, data handling, or network activity is present. The main concern is the suspicious name, which could be a typo, a custom module, or a maliciously crafted package mimicking 'requests'. The minimal code and lack of execution or data flow indicate no malicious activity. The suspicion about the module name warrants further investigation, but based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form. The primary concern is the module name 'frequest', which should be verified for legitimacy. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet. The scores should reflect low malware and obfuscation likelihood, with a moderate security risk due to the suspicious module name.",
