  "purpose": "Import HTTP request methods (get, post, put, patch, delete) from the 'frequest' library, likely for performing HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'frequest' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only import statement with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The module 'frequest' appears to be a misspelling or variation of 'requests', which is a common HTTP library, but 'frequest' is not standard. No additional code or logic is present, so no anomalies in behavior. The code is minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports HTTP methods from a module named 'frequest'. Since no further logic, data handling, or network operations are shown, there is no evidence of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The name 'frequest' could be a typo or a custom module; without further context, it appears benign. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior. Without additional code, no security issues are apparent. The only concern could be the module name 'frequest', which may be a typo or a custom/local module, but it does not indicate malicious intent.",
