      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing heavy obfuscation, system API interactions, and conditional system modifications. It is designed to conceal malicious activities such as package installation, privilege escalation, and system sabotage. It should be treated as malware with high severity, and further forensic analysis is recommended before any deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, indicating a high potential for malicious activity, especially in reports 4 and 5. Scores should be slightly elevated for these reports to reflect the suspicion. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, emphasizing caution in handling these dependencies."
