  "malware_score": 0.65,
  "security_risk": 0.65,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, indicating a high potential for malicious activity, especially in reports 4 and 5. Scores should be slightly elevated for these reports to reflect the suspicion. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, emphasizing caution in handling these dependencies."
