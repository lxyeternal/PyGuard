      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating a significant security threat. The pattern suggests malicious intent, possibly for payload delivery or system compromise. The high scores for malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified based on the evidence. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command are recommended before deploying or distributing this package."
