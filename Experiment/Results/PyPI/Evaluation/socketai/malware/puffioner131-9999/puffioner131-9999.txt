      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation to a suspicious external server, with insecure transmission. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be flagged as malicious or compromised. It poses a serious security risk and should not be used in production environments."
