  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to send environment variables to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ, external HTTP POST request using requests.post",
  "sinks": "requests.post to external server (sending environment data)",
  "flows": "os.environ → env_data → requests.post → external server",
  "anomalies": "The code sends all environment variables unconditionally to an external URL during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL is obfuscated or suspicious-looking, and the request bypasses SSL verification (verify=False), which is a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard install command to include a step that collects all environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a remote server. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user consent or awareness. The request bypasses SSL verification, indicating potential malicious intent to hide communication. The URL used is suspicious and may be associated with malicious activities. No other malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or destructive actions, is evident beyond this data exfiltration attempt. The code does not perform any other harmful actions or malicious behavior beyond this data leak.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating environment variables during installation without user consent. It bypasses SSL verification and sends potentially sensitive data to a suspicious external server, constituting a security threat. The package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
