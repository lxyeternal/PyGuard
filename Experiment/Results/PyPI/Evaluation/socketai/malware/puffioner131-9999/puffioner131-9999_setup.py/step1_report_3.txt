{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that extends setuptools.install to send environment variables to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, code execution occurs during the install command in the run() method, and a POST request is made using requests.",
  "sinks": "Sending environment data to an external URL (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com) over HTTP, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables, then sends them over a network connection during installation, which could be exploited to exfiltrate data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending all environment variables to an external server during setup, which is not standard for a package installation. The URL used is suspiciously hosted on oastify.com, a known testing domain for security testing, indicating potential malicious intent. The code ignores SSL verification (verify=False), which is insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the install process, imports requests and sends all environment variables to an external domain. This is executed automatically during setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The external server could collect sensitive information such as environment variables, credentials, or tokens. Using verify=False disables SSL verification, increasing security risk. The setup() function hooks this behavior into the install command via cmdclass, meaning anyone installing this package will trigger this data exfiltration without explicit consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs malicious-like behavior by secretly exfiltrating environment variables to a remote server during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious, indicates potential data theft, and should be considered malicious. The use of a known testing domain and insecure connection further supports this assessment.",
