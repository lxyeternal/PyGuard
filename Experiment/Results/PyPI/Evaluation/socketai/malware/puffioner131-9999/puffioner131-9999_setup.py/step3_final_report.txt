{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to exfiltrate all environment variables to a suspicious external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads all environment variables via os.environ.items() during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via requests.post() to an external URL, transmitting potentially sensitive environment data over an insecure connection.",
  "flows": "The source (environment variables) flows directly into the requests.post() call, which transmits the data to the external server during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally collects and exfiltrates all environment variables during setup without user consent, disables SSL verification (verify=False), and uses a suspicious URL hosted on oastify.com, a known testing/exfiltration domain.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. It uses insecure transmission and a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the exfiltration occurs silently during setup, posing a serious security risk. The high malware score (~0.9) and security risk (~0.9) are justified based on the behavior. The code does not perform other malicious actions but the exfiltration alone warrants high scores. The code's intent appears malicious, aiming to steal environment data without user knowledge, making it a supply chain security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation to a suspicious external server, with insecure transmission. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be flagged as malicious or compromised. It poses a serious security risk and should not be used in production environments.",
