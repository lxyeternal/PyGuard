      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics for stealthy payload delivery. Scores across reports are justified; a slight increase in malware and risk scores is warranted. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious until further decoding of the PowerShell command confirms benign intent."
