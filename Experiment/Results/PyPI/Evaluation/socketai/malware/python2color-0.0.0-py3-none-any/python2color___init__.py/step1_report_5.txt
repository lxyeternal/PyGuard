{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data exfiltration tool designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from the user's system and send this data to external servers via webhook URLs. It also includes functionalities to infect Discord applications with malicious code and zip various data for upload.",
  "sources": "Reads user environment variables, system information, Discord data directories, browser profile data, local storage, leveldb files, and cookies from specific file paths; also reads log files and passwords from browser databases.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to specified webhook URLs; writes malicious code into Discord client files; creates ZIP archives of collected data and uploads them to external servers; executes system commands to kill processes.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system files, browser databases, and environment variables (sources) and then transmitted via HTTP requests or written into files (sinks). The data collection functions call each other, and information flows into the functions that upload or send data, including token, cookie, password, and file data, to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated or indirect file and path handling; dynamic process termination commands; embedded webhook URL; attempts to bypass typical protections by checking system identifiers (hostname, MAC, HWID); infection of Discord installation files with remote JavaScript code; large and complex multi-threaded structure; code for collecting cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from multiple sources; automatic installation of dependencies; specific IP and hostname blacklists to avoid detection.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple typical malicious behaviors, such as collecting user tokens, passwords, cookies, and sensitive files; infecting Discord client files with malicious injection code; exfiltrating data via HTTP requests to controlled servers; creating ZIP archives of targeted files; attempting process termination of specific applications like browsers and wallets; using threading for concurrent data collection; checking system identifiers and blacklists to avoid detection; installing dependencies dynamically; reading local system info and geolocation data. The presence of hardcoded URLs, obfuscated paths, process kill commands, and injection of JavaScript into Discord strongly indicate malicious intent. The code is designed to stealthily gather sensitive user data, infect applications, and transfer data to malicious servers.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly malicious, performing extensive data theft (tokens, passwords, cookies, files), system infection (Discord JavaScript injection), and data exfiltration via external servers. It employs obfuscation and system checks to evade detection, and its primary purpose is malicious surveillance and information theft.",
