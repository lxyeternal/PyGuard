{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data extraction, credential harvesting, and information theft, including stealing browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and files from the user system, then exfiltrating this data to external servers and via Discord webhooks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user directories, browser profile directories, log and database files (e.g., 'Login Data', 'Cookies', '.log', '.ldb', 'Local State'), files within specific application directories, and user input from log files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to remote URLs, writing malicious payloads into browser extension files, executing system commands (taskkill, PowerShell, etc.), file uploads to external services (Gofile, Transfer.sh, Anonfiles), and Discord webhook notifications with exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser files, system info, log files, user directories) are read and processed (e.g., decrypted credentials, cookies, tokens). Data is then uploaded to external servers and sent via Discord webhook, often in multithreaded processes. Certain actions also involve modifying local files (e.g., injecting malicious code into Discord extensions).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation is minimal but includes the use of generic variable names and some inconsistent formatting. The script actively kills processes, modifies browser extension files, and attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data without user consent. Use of hardcoded URLs, malicious file modification, and external data exfiltration points are suspicious. The code includes multiple functions dedicated to credential and cookie theft, as well as file collection from user directories, which are typical of malware.",
  "analysis": "The script is highly suspicious, exhibiting typical behaviors of credential-stealing malware, such as extracting stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers, and injecting malicious code into Discord extension files to capture tokens or perform further malicious activities. It also attempts to exfiltrate collected data through various means, including Discord webhooks and external file hosting services. The code kills processes (e.g., Metamask, Steam) to prevent interference with data collection, and it copies files like 'Login Data' and 'Cookies' from user directories. The code employs threading for concurrent operations, ensuring efficiency in data collection. Overall, it is clearly designed for malicious purposes, including privacy invasion, credential theft, and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious data stealer and backdoor toolkit, designed to harvest user credentials, cookies, tokens, and files from various applications and browsers, then exfiltrate the data through webhooks and external servers. It exhibits multiple indicators of malware, including process termination, file modification, credential extraction, and network exfiltration, all without user consent. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the code should be considered malicious malware.",
