{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, including stealing sensitive user information such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and browser data; injecting malicious scripts into Discord installations; gathering system information; and exfiltrating data via Discord webhooks and file uploads to third-party servers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, system commands, files from browser and application data directories, log files, and user inputs during execution. Specific sources are system paths for browser profiles, Discord data, Steam, Riot Client, Telegram, and various local files related to saved credentials and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent to external URLs via HTTP POST requests, including webhook URLs, file uploads to third-party servers, and potentially malicious scripts injected into Discord core files. Data exfiltration occurs through requests to webhooks, requests to gofile.io, and file uploads, which serve as data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system sources (browser cookies, passwords, tokens, system info) through data extraction functions, then to external servers via HTTP requests or file uploads. For example, tokens and passwords are extracted from files, processed/decrypted, and then sent to webhooks or uploaded to external hosting services. The injection of malicious scripts into Discord files also creates a flow from local file modification to persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL and injection URL, malicious injection of JavaScript into Discord files, suspicious system info collection, and multiple obfuscated or redundant code sections. The code contains potentially malicious payloads such as token theft, cookie stealing, password extraction, and system information gathering. Use of threading for data collection and exfiltration without user consent is also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive system reconnaissance, including collecting user tokens, cookies, passwords, and system identifiers (HWID, IP). It injects malicious JavaScript into Discord client files to potentially run further malicious code. It uploads gathered data (cookies, passwords, files) to third-party services like gofile.io and via webhooks. It also manipulates browser data, attempts to kill specific processes, and exfiltrates user information stealthily. The presence of hardcoded URLs, injection mechanisms, and data collection from multiple sources indicates malicious intent. The code also attempts to persist by copying itself to startup folders. The overall structure, such as obfuscation and redundant code, suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious behavior, including data theft, system information gathering, injection of malicious scripts, and exfiltration to external servers. It is designed to compromise user privacy, hijack system data, and potentially facilitate further malicious activity. The script's multiple techniques for stealth and data exfiltration confirm it is malware.",
