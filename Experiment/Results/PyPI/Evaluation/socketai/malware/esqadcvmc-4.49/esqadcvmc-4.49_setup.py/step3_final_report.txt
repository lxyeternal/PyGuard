  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution in setup script, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists('tahg') check triggers subprocess.Popen with encoded command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command, potentially downloading or executing malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> execute obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess when absent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, hidden PowerShell command; silent execution with creationflags; suppression of errors with broad try-except.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command based on filesystem check. The command is encoded, executed silently, and includes a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent. The setup() call is wrapped in try-except, hiding errors. The obfuscation and silent execution are typical of malware payloads, and the URL suggests command and control or malicious download. The code's behavior aligns with known malicious techniques, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution likely intended for malicious purposes, such as payload download or remote code execution. The behavior warrants a high malware score (~0.9), high obfuscation (~0.9), and high security risk (~0.9). The package should be flagged as malicious until further payload decoding confirms intent.",
