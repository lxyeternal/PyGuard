  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution likely intended for malicious purposes, such as payload download or remote code execution. The behavior warrants a high malware score (~0.9), high obfuscation (~0.9), and high security risk (~0.9). The package should be flagged as malicious until further payload decoding confirms intent."
