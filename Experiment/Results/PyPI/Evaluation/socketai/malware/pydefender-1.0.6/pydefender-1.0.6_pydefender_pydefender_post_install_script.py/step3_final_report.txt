{
  "purpose": "Send a notification to a Discord webhook and verify the installation of 'pydefender' via subprocess call.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, subprocess.call(['pydefender'])",
  "sinks": "Webhook URL could be misused if exposed, subprocess call executes external command which could be malicious if compromised",
  "flows": "Webhook URL is used as a parameter in send_discord_webhook, then subprocess.call executes 'pydefender'",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, execution of external command without validation",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly sends a message via a hardcoded webhook and runs an external command. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The webhook URL's exposure could lead to misuse, and executing 'pydefender' without validation could be exploited if the command is malicious or replaced. Malware likelihood is low; the main concern is the security risk posed by hardcoded secrets and external process execution. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score at 0.1 and risk score around 0.5, reflecting moderate concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious payloads but exposes security risks due to hardcoded secrets and external command execution. It warrants caution but is not inherently malicious.",
