{
  "purpose": "The setup script for the 'pydefender' package, which appears to facilitate file obfuscation and related functionalities, with a post-install script executed after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools, subprocess, and the post_install_script.py within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'post_install_script.py' via subprocess call; potentially executing arbitrary code if the script is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method triggers the subprocess call to execute 'post_install_script.py', which could be malicious if the script contains harmful code.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an external script ('post_install_script.py') immediately after installation without any validation or security checks; use of a custom install command to run additional code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, runs an external Python script. The script 'post_install_script.py' is invoked via subprocess without any validation, sanitization, or restrictions. This behavior can be exploited if the external script is malicious or has been compromised, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation. The package setup appears standard with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The presence of many dependencies warrants caution, but they are typical for a package with obfuscation and web interactions. The direct execution of an external script in the post-install step is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors, malware, or tracking mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "While the package appears to be a legitimate setup for a file obfuscator with typical dependencies, the execution of an external script during installation is a security concern. It could be exploited to run malicious code, especially if the script is compromised or fetched from an untrusted source. This behavior warrants caution and further review of 'post_install_script.py'.",
