{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines package metadata and dependencies, and executes an external script 'post_install_script.py' during installation via subprocess, which could pose security risks if untrusted.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call executing 'python post_install_script.py' during the run method of the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'post_install_script.py' potentially leads to arbitrary code execution, system modifications, or malicious activities if the script is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "The source is the subprocess call in the custom install class; the sink is the execution of the external script, which could run malicious code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of an external script during setup without validation or sandboxing; no verification of 'post_install_script.py' contents; standard setup code otherwise.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard setup.py with a custom install command that runs an external script during installation. This pattern is common but risky if the script is untrusted. The script's content is unknown, so potential malicious activity cannot be confirmed but remains a concern. The scores assigned in reports vary, with malware scores around 0.4-0.6 and security risks similarly elevated, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution. No obfuscation is present. The main risk stems from executing external code without validation, which could be exploited if the script is malicious. To mitigate, maintainers should review or remove such scripts, or validate their integrity before execution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears standard but includes executing an external script during installation, which is a security concern. Without inspecting 'post_install_script.py', malicious intent cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution. The assigned scores should reflect the potential risk, with malware and security risk scores increased to account for the danger of untrusted code execution.",
