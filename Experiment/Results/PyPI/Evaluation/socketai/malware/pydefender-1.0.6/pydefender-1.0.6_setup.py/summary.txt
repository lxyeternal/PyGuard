  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears standard but includes executing an external script during installation, which is a security concern. Without inspecting 'post_install_script.py', malicious intent cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution. The assigned scores should reflect the potential risk, with malware and security risk scores increased to account for the danger of untrusted code execution."
