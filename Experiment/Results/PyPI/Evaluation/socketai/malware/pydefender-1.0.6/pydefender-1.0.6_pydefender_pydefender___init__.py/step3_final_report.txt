  "purpose": "The code snippets are either empty, placeholders, or incomplete, with no evident malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "No data sources present; code is absent or minimal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data exfiltration points identified; no external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets are either empty or placeholders, with no logic, variables, or data handling. The reports correctly identify the lack of suspicious activity. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores are minimal (around 0.0 to 0.2), reflecting the absence of any malicious or risky behavior. Confidence levels are high given the simplicity and completeness of the assessment. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, either empty or placeholders, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
