      "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears standard but includes executing an external script during installation, which is a security concern. Without inspecting 'post_install_script.py', malicious intent cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution. The assigned scores should reflect the potential risk, with malware and security risk scores increased to account for the danger of untrusted code execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, employs eval on decoded payloads, and uses multiple encoding layers, all of which are classic indicators of malicious malware. It should be classified as malicious with a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score of 1.0, and security risk score of 1.0. It poses a critical security threat and must be handled with extreme caution."
