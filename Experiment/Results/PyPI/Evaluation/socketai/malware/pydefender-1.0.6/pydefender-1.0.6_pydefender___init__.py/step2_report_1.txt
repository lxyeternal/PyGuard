  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports indicate that the provided code snippets are empty, placeholders, or incomplete.\n- No executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risks are all scored as zero across reports.\n- Confidence levels vary but are generally high when the code is confirmed empty.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is an empty comment block with no logic.\n- **Logic/Errors:** No errors; the conclusion that there's no malicious activity is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0. **Scores seem appropriate.**\n- **Justification for scores:** The absence of code means no malicious activity is possible.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** No code present, no analysis possible.\n- **Logic/Errors:** Correctly notes lack of content.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Justification:** No code, no threat.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, no executable content.\n- **Logic/Errors:** Correctly identifies the code as empty and suggests caution due to potential concealment, which is reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, but the note on caution is prudent.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** No code, no analysis.\n- **Logic/Errors:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** No code, cannot analyze.\n- **Logic/Errors:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no code or suspicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, given the absence of code.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0, since there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n- The code snippets are placeholders or incomplete.\n- No malicious activity is detectable or implied.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The complete absence of code precludes any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is nonexistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the content. No adjustments are necessary. The key point is that these are empty or placeholder snippets, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risk.",
