{
  "purpose": "The code snippets are placeholders or incomplete, containing no executable content or data flows, thus no malicious or security issues are present.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code is empty or only contains comments/whitespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is non-existent or non-operational.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, only placeholders or comments; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of executable code, with scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk set to zero. Confidence levels are appropriate given the lack of content. No analysis of malicious behavior or obfuscation is possible due to the empty snippets. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippets are empty placeholders with no malicious or security risks. The scores and evaluations across reports are appropriate and consistent with the content. No further action or concern is warranted.",
