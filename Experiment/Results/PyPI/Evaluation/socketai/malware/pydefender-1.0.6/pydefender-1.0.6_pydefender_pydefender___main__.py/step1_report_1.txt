{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated malicious code that performs hidden operations, possibly involving data decoding, decryption, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Decoding functions, base64 decoding, and possibly input or external data via decoding and eval.",
  "sinks": "eval(), decode(), base64 decoding, and dynamic function calls that may execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Decoded data flows through multiple decoding functions, potentially leading to eval() or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with excessive base64 decoding, multiple layers of decoding, and eval(), suggesting intent to hide malicious behavior. Use of eval() on decoded data is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on eval() and multiple layers of decoding (base64 and custom decoding functions). It appears designed to obfuscate its true intent by decoding hidden payloads at runtime. The presence of 'eval' on decoded data is a major indicator of malicious intent, as it could execute arbitrary code. Multiple decoding steps and hidden payloads suggest an attempt to conceal malicious operations, possibly to exfiltrate data, execute remote commands, or perform other harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to extensive obfuscation, use of eval(), and layered decoding mechanisms. It likely contains malicious behavior or sabotage, designed to hide its real purpose from straightforward analysis.",
