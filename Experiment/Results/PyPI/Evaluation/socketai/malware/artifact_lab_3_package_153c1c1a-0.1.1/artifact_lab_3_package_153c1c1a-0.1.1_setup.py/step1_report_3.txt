{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes custom behaviors during installation and development to send environment variables to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read using os.environ within the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "The environment variables are captured as source; then they are encoded and transmitted over the network to an external server as sink.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is invoked during both install and develop commands, which causes the environment data to be sent automatically during package installation or development setup without user consent. This behavior is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools modules and defines functions for installation behaviors. The function notmalfunc() captures all environment variables, encodes them, and transmits them to a specified webhook URL. This is executed during both 'install' and 'develop' commands via custom classes AfterInstall and AfterDevelop. The use of environment variables and the act of exfiltrating them to an external URL without any explicit user approval indicates malicious intent. The code does not sanitize or restrict the data sent; it potentially leaks sensitive environment information. The URL used appears to be a testing webhook, but the behavior itself is dangerous as it secretly transmits data.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during installation and development processes. Such activity could lead to privacy breaches and security risks. The core concern is the automatic, unprompted sending of potentially sensitive data to an external webhook, which is indicative of malicious intent.",
