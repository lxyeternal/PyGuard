{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation and development commands for a Python package, including custom post-install and post-develop hooks that send environment data to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables with os.environ; reading code files (if any, not present here); user input is not explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via urllib.request.urlopen to an external URL (webhook).",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent to the webhook URL (sink) during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends all environment variables to an external server during install and develop commands without any user consent or indication; no validation or sanitization. The URL used is a webhook, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools and defines functions for custom install and develop commands. The 'notmalfunc' function collects environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to an external URL. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation and development. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as file modification, network spying, or persistent backdoors. However, sending environment variables to an external webhook without disclosure constitutes a privacy risk and potentially malicious data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and does not appear obfuscated or malicious beyond this data exfiltration. The overall structure is standard for a setup script, with the addition of the data-sending function.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external webhook during package installation and development. While it doesn't perform destructive actions or stealthy persistence, this behavior indicates a privacy invasion and potential supply chain attack vector. It should be considered malicious due to the undisclosed data leakage.",
