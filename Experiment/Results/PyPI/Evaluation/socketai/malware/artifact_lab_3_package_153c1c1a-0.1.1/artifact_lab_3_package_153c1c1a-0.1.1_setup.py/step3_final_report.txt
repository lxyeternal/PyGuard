  "purpose": "Collects all environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external webhook during package installation and development commands.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen (sending data to external URL)",
  "flows": "notmalfunc() collects os.environ, encodes, and sends via HTTP POST during run() of install/develop commands",
  "anomalies": "Silent exfiltration of environment data during setup without user notification or consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that, during package setup (install and develop), collect all environment variables and send them to a specified external URL via an HTTP request. This occurs automatically without user awareness. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs unauthorized data exfiltration, which is a privacy and security concern. The behavior matches typical malicious supply chain tactics, especially since environment variables may contain sensitive data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, security risk ~0.9-1) are justified given the activity. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, but the exfiltration alone is enough to classify the activity as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by silently exfiltrating environment variables during package setup, posing a high privacy and security risk. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as malicious activity.",
