{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes custom install and develop commands to send environment variables to an external webhook URL during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables are read from os.environ in the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables (source) in notmalfunc(), encodes and transmits them over the network (sink) when the custom install or develop command runs.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() is invoked automatically during package installation and development, which is unusual and can be considered malicious, especially since it exfiltrates environment data without user consent. The webhook URL appears hardcoded and external, potentially used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the 'install' and 'develop' commands to include a call to notmalfunc(). This function collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP request to a specific external URL. The behavior of sending environment variables externally during package installation is suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscation or complex logic but performs a malicious action stealthily. It uses standard library modules for network communication and environment access, with no input validation or user notification. Overall, it appears designed to secretly collect and transmit environment data at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation or development setup without user awareness, via a hardcoded webhook URL. This constitutes a security risk and indicates intentional data leakage. The overall security risk is high due to this exfiltration behavior.",
