{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a function to send environment variables to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read via os.environ in the notmalfunc() function.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "os.environ → urllib.parse.urlencode → urllib.request.Request → urllib.request.urlopen",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically transmits environment variables to an external server during installation or development setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules for package setup, and defines functions and classes for custom install and develop commands. The function notmalfunc() collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a specified URL, likely for data exfiltration. This function is called during both installation and development via overridden run methods in custom classes. The overall setup indicates a deliberate data leak behavior embedded in the package setup process, without any legitimate reason presented in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during package installation and development, which constitutes a significant privacy and security risk. It does not appear to serve a legitimate purpose and should be considered malicious.",
