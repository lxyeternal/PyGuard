{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that, upon installation or development setup, sends environment variables to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' reads environment variables using os.environ.",
  "sinks": "The environment data is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The environment variables (source) are collected, encoded, and transmitted over the network to the remote server (sink) during 'install' or 'develop' commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains functions that send all environment variables to an external URL during package installation or development, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL appears to be a webhook endpoint, potentially for data exfiltration. The code performs this operation silently, without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and overrides 'install' and 'develop' commands to execute a function that captures all environment variables and sends them to a remote webhook URL. This operation occurs during package setup phases, which are typical points for malicious data exfiltration. The environment data, including potentially sensitive information, is encoded and sent over HTTP without encryption or user awareness. The code does not validate the remote URL or restrict what data is sent, indicating possible malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious imports, but the behavior itself is suspicious due to silent data transmission during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external webhook during installation or development, which could lead to sensitive data leakage. This is a significant security concern and indicates malicious intent.",
