{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no input or external dependencies.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a trivial function that outputs a static greeting. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
