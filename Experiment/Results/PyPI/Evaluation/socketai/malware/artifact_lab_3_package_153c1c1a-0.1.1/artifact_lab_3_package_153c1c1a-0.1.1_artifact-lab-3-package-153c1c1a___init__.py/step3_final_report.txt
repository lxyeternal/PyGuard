  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, obfuscation, and malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, files, command-line arguments, network endpoints, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), input/output functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions, possibly leading to sinks like network transmission, file output, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated strings, suspicious URLs, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded URLs or credentials, unusual import patterns, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data processing patterns with no suspicious activity in most reports. Report 4 contains multiple indicators of malicious intent: obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious URLs, and network activity, justifying high malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.75) scores. Other reports show benign patterns with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, supporting low scores. The confidence levels align with the visibility and clarity of the code snippets. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with the exception of Report 2's cautious stance on dynamic execution potential, which remains reasonable given the limited evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malicious potential, supported by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4's suspicious patterns justify higher scores. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily influenced by Report 4. The scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence accurately.",
