  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malicious potential, supported by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4's suspicious patterns justify higher scores. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily influenced by Report 4. The scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence accurately."
