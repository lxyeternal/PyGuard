{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious behavior during package setup, specifically executing an obfuscated PowerShell command contacting a suspicious domain when 'tahg' directory is absent.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, potentially leading to remote code execution or payload download.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; encoded command runs silently with no window, contacting external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution, silent exception handling, contact with suspicious domain, obfuscation of payload.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed when 'tahg' does not exist. The command contacts a suspicious domain and runs silently, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation and concealment tactics suggest an attempt to evade detection. The silent error handling may hide failures. The package setup appears legitimate but is used as a vehicle for malicious payloads. The presence of a suspicious URL within the encoded command further indicates malicious activity. Given these signals, the behavior is highly suspicious, with high confidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload contacting a suspicious domain, executed silently during package setup. This indicates malicious activity with high likelihood, warranting classification as malicious or compromised.",
