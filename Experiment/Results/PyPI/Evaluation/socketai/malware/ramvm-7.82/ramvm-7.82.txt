      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during setup, which is indicative of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.8, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.8) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior. This package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms the command's content."
