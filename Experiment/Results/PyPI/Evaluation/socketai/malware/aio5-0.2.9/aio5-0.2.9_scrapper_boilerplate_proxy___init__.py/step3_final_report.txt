  "purpose": "Proxy scraping and testing connectivity to Facebook via proxies.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for ChromeDriver path, fetching proxy list from sslproxies.org, selecting a proxy, making HTTP request to Facebook through the proxy.",
  "sinks": "Requests made via proxies to Facebook, potential network activity but no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Load env -> scrape proxies -> select proxy -> request Facebook with proxy -> output status.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Selenium parameters ('chrome_options'), platform-specific 'os.system' calls ('clear'/'cls'), lack of input validation, hardcoded URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs proxy scraping using Selenium, then tests connectivity to Facebook via a randomly chosen proxy. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. Minor issues include deprecated Selenium parameters and platform-dependent console commands, which do not impact security. The proxy list is fetched from a public source, and the code's purpose appears benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to minor operational concerns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign consistent scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a proxy testing utility with no malicious intent or malware. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
