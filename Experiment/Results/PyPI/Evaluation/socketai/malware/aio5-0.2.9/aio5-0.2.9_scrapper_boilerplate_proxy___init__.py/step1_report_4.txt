{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a headless web driver to scrape proxy IP addresses from a website, then randomly selects a proxy to attempt a request to Facebook's mobile login page through that proxy.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (CHROMEDRIVER_PATH), fetches webpage content via selenium driver, and makes an HTTP request via requests with a selected proxy.",
  "sinks": "The code sends a request to Facebook's mobile login page through a proxy; no untrusted data is directly written or stored, but network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Environment variable → Selenium-driven browser fetches proxy list → Random proxy selected → Requests library uses proxy to connect to Facebook → Proxy info and response status are printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.system' to clear screen; printing proxy info; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious or hidden behaviors detected; the code's purpose appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables, uses Selenium to scrape proxies from a website, then randomly chooses a proxy to connect to Facebook. The process involves fetching data, random selection, and network communication. No data leakage, credential theft, or malicious code is observed. The use of 'os.system' for clearing the screen is benign but unconventional. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate proxy testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It only performs network operations and proxy scraping. No security threats are identified.",
