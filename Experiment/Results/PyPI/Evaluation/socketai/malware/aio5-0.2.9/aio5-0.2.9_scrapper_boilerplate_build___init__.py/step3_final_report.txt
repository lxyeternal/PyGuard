  "purpose": "Determine resource paths in Python applications, supporting both development and packaged environments (e.g., PyInstaller).",
  "sources": "Checks for sys._MEIPASS and __file__ to establish base path.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input source is sys._MEIPASS or __file__, which are used to construct the resource path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard pattern for resource path resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to set a base path for resources, first by checking if sys._MEIPASS exists (used by PyInstaller), and defaults to the directory of the current script (__file__) if not. It then joins this base path with a relative resource path. The pattern is common and well-understood, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or dynamic execution. The use of sys._MEIPASS is standard for packaged applications, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard resource path resolver used in Python packaging. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the only minor inconsistency is a slightly elevated security risk score in one report, which should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
