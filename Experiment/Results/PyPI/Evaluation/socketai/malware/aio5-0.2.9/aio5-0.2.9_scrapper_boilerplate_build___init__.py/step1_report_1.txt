  "purpose": "Determine the file path for resource access, supporting both development and bundled executable environments.",
  "sources": "Reading sys._MEIPASS (if it exists) and __file__ to determine the base path.",
  "sinks": "os.path.join to create a file path based on the determined base path.",
  "flows": "sys._MEIPASS or __file__ -> base_path -> os.path.join -> resource_path output",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._MEIPASS suggests support for PyInstaller or similar packaging tools, but this is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to get the resource path, checking for sys._MEIPASS, which is used when the program is packaged with tools like PyInstaller. If not present, it defaults to the directory of the current script (__file__). This is a common pattern for resource access in packaged Python applications. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for resource path resolution in packaged Python applications. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
