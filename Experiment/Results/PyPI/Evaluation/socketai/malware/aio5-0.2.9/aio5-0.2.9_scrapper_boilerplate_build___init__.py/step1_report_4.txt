{
  "purpose": "The function resource_path is used to determine the absolute path to a resource file, accommodating both standard execution and PyInstaller bundled environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (__file__), and accesses sys._MEIPASS if available.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, command execution, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__ or sys._MEIPASS) is used to generate a file path via os.path.join, but no untrusted input or data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and common for packaging scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the resource path, handling both normal Python execution and PyInstaller packaging via sys._MEIPASS. It does not include any user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated patterns. It is a standard utility function with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility function for resource path resolution in packaged Python applications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
