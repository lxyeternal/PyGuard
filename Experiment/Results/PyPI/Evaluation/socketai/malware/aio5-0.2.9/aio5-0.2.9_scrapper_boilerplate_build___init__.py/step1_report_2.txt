{
  "purpose": "The function resource_path is designed to construct a file path relative to the application's base directory, handling both standard script execution and PyInstaller-packaged environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the sys._MEIPASS attribute and the __file__ variable to determine the base path.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that send or write data to external systems or files. It only constructs a file path.",
  "flows": "Input from sys._MEIPASS or __file__ flows into os.path.join to generate the resource path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of sys._MEIPASS is standard for PyInstaller bundles. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the base path for resource files. It first tries to access sys._MEIPASS, which is an attribute used by PyInstaller to specify the temporary folder where bundled files are extracted. If that attribute does not exist, it defaults to the directory of the current script (__file__). It then joins this base path with the provided relative_path. This pattern is typical for scripts that are intended to run both as standalone scripts and as PyInstaller executables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with standard resource management practices in packaged Python applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for managing resource paths in Python applications that may be packaged with PyInstaller. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
