  "purpose": "Determine the correct file path based on the execution environment, either bundled by PyInstaller or run normally.",
  "sources": "sys._MEIPASS (if available), __file__ (fallback)",
  "sinks": "os.path.join",
  "flows": "sys._MEIPASS or __file__ -> os.path.join -> return path",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._MEIPASS, a hidden attribute specific to PyInstaller; no other suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The function resource_path attempts to determine the correct resource directory whether the code is running as a bundled executable created by PyInstaller or as a standard script. It accesses sys._MEIPASS, which is a temporary directory used by PyInstaller at runtime, and falls back to using the directory of the current script. The code then joins this base path with a relative resource path. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors; it simply handles resource path resolution. The use of sys._MEIPASS is standard for PyInstaller-packaged applications and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical resource path resolver for applications packaged with PyInstaller. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks, merely handling environment-specific paths.",
