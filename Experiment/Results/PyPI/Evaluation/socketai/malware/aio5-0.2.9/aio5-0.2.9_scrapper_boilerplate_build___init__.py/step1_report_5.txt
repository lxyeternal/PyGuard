{
  "purpose": "The function resource_path is designed to determine the absolute path to a resource file, accommodating both development and packaged (e.g., PyInstaller) environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the sys module (sys._MEIPASS) and the __file__ attribute of the current script.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a file path based on the determined base path, which could potentially be used to access files.",
  "flows": "The code checks for sys._MEIPASS; if it exists, it uses that as the base path, otherwise it uses the directory of the current script (__file__). It then joins the relative path to this base to produce an absolute path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code performs standard path resolution for packaged Python applications; no suspicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to resolve resource paths, handling both normal execution and PyInstaller packaged environments. It uses exception handling to check for the presence of sys._MEIPASS, which is a typical pattern. The code does not include any external inputs, user inputs, or network activity. It only manipulates paths based on the environment, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for resource path resolution in packaged Python applications. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
