  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard resource path resolver used in Python packaging. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the only minor inconsistency is a slightly elevated security risk score in one report, which should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."
