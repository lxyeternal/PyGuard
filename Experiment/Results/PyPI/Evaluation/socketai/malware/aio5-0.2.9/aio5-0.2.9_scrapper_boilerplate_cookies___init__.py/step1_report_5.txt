  "purpose": "The code manages browser cookies by saving them to and loading them from a pickle file for session persistence.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from the pickle file 'cookies.pkl' and from the driver via driver.get_cookies()",
  "sinks": "Loads cookie data into the driver with driver.add_cookie(cookie)",
  "flows": "If 'cookies.pkl' exists, loads cookies from file and adds to driver; otherwise, dumps cookies from driver to file",
  "anomalies": "Uses pickle to deserialize data, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle file is maliciously crafted; lacks validation or sandboxing",
  "analysis": "The code uses pickle.load() to deserialize cookies without verifying the content, which is a security risk if the pickle file is tampered with. The use of pickle for storing cookie data, which can include complex objects, poses potential security issues, especially if an attacker can modify 'cookies.pkl'. The code does not sanitize or validate the deserialized data before using it. The rest of the logic is straightforward, managing cookie persistence, but the reliance on pickle introduces a significant risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code's use of pickle.load() to load cookie data is potentially malicious, as it can execute arbitrary code if the pickle file is maliciously crafted. While the functionality appears benign, this implementation poses a security risk due to unsafe deserialization. No malware behavior is evident beyond this deserialization risk.",
