  "purpose": "Manage cookies by saving and loading them from a pickle file for session persistence.",
  "sources": "Reading existing pickle file ('cookies.pkl') and the driver.get_cookies() method.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load() and pickle.dump() functions operating on 'cookies.pkl'.",
  "flows": "Loading cookies from pickle file into driver; saving driver cookies into pickle file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization without validation, sanitization, or integrity checks; potential for arbitrary code execution if pickle file is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pickle.load() to deserialize cookie data and pickle.dump() to serialize cookies. No validation or security measures are implemented, making it vulnerable to maliciously crafted pickle files. No malicious behavior or malware is present; the main concern is the security risk associated with unsafe deserialization. The use of pickle in this context is a known security vulnerability, especially if the pickle file can be tampered with or accessed by untrusted sources. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The security risk score should reflect the potential for code execution if the pickle file is compromised, which is significant but not indicative of active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in purpose but employs unsafe pickle serialization, posing a security risk if the pickle file is tampered with. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary concern is the potential for arbitrary code execution during unpickling, which warrants a moderate security risk score. The overall assessment is that the code is functional but insecure due to the use of pickle without safeguards.",
