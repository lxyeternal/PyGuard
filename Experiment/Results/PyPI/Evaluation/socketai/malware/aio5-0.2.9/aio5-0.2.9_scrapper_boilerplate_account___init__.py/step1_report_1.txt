  "purpose": "Cycle through a list of accounts in a rotating manner",
  "sources": "Initialization with accounts list, calling nextAccount() method",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data",
  "flows": "Initialization -> nextAccount() method call -> cycle iterator produces next account",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that takes a list of accounts and uses itertools.cycle to create an infinite iterator. The nextAccount() method simply returns the next account from this cycle. The implementation is straightforward and does not include any data leakage, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior. It relies on standard library features and has no embedded network calls or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for rotating accounts, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
