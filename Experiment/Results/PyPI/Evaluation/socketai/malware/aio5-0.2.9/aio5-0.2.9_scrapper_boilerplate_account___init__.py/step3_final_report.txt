{
  "purpose": "A utility class to cycle through a list of accounts indefinitely, providing the next account on each call.",
  "sources": "Initialization with a list of accounts; uses itertools.cycle to create an iterator.",
  "sinks": "The method nextAccount() returns the next account; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization -> cycle iterator -> nextAccount() -> returns next account in cycle.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network calls, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard implementation using Python's itertools.cycle to rotate through accounts. It does not process untrusted data, does not output externally, and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The logic is clear, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code's purpose is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for rotating accounts with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
