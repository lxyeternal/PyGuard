{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the 'scrapper_boilerplate' package, likely used for web scraping automation tasks such as account management, resource handling, cookies, proxies, Selenium setup, Telegram notifications, timers, WebDriver handling, parsing, and logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'scrapper_boilerplate' modules, which read module dependencies but do not execute code or handle data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this code snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident in the import statements; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a well-known web scraping framework. No executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation is visible. The import statements are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. Without further implementation details, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided import statements, there is no indication of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign, and the current scores are appropriate. Full security assessment requires examining the actual implementations of these modules, but from this snippet alone, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
