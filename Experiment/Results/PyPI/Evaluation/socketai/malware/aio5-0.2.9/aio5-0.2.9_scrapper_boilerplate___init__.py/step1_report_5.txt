  "purpose": "Import modules and functions from the 'scrapper_boilerplate' package for web scraping operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'scrapper_boilerplate' modules: account, build, cookies, file_handler, proxy, setup, telegram, timer, webdriver_handler, parser_handler, output.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only imports functions and classes. No data processing, network, or file operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this snippet; it only shows import statements.",
  "anomalies": "All imported modules appear to be standard parts of a web scraper framework. No suspicious code or obfuscated features are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet is a set of import statements from the 'scrapper_boilerplate' package, which appears to be a structured web scraping toolkit. The imports include modules for account rotation, resource path handling, cookie management, file handling, proxy setup, selenium configuration, Telegram notifications, random timing, webdriver and parser handling, and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated code. The imports seem appropriate for a scraper framework. As no actual execution or data handling is included, no malicious or security risks can be identified at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements from a legitimate-looking web scraping library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues in this snippet.",
