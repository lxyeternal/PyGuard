  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is only a set of import statements from the 'scrapper_boilerplate' package. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation in these snippets. The code itself appears benign, and no immediate issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that only import statements are shown, and without additional code, no malicious activity can be inferred. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Also 0, consistent with the clear import statements.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports and the code snippet show only benign import statements, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The overall risk remains very low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge that the code is only import statements and that a full security assessment requires examining the imported modules' implementations.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the evidence presented. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, as only benign import statements are shown.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify that without the implementation details of the imported modules, a full security assessment isn't possible.  \n- Given the evidence, the overall security posture appears benign.\n\n**In conclusion**, based on the provided import statements and the reports' analyses, I agree with the assigned scores. No changes are necessary. The code snippet itself does not pose any security risks.",
