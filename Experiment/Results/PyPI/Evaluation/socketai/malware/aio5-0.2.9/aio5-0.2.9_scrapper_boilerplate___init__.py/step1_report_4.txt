{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules from the 'scrapper_boilerplate' package, likely used for web scraping activities including account rotation, resource handling, cookies, proxies, Selenium setup, Telegram notifications, timing, WebDriver management, parsing, and logging.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the package; no direct data input sources are evident within these lines.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writing, or execution functions are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows, data flows, or untrusted data handling in these import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present in these import statements. All imports appear standard for a web scraping framework.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a presumably open-source 'scrapper_boilerplate' package. No executable code, user input handling, or data processing is shown. The imported modules suggest functionality related to web scraping automation, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system compromise activities. Since only imports are provided, there is no evidence of malicious or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is limited to importing modules from an open-source package used for web scraping purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from these import statements alone. Without additional executable code or context, there are no security concerns identified.",
