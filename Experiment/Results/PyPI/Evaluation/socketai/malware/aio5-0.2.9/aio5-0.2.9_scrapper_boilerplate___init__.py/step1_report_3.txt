  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in the provided code snippet. All lines are import statements.",
  "flows": "Since these are import statements, there are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected in import statements. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements importing modules related to web scraping and automation functionalities. No code execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling occurs here. Without additional code, there's no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. The imported modules could perform a wide range of functions, but based on this snippet alone, the code appears to be standard setup for a web scraper.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of import statements from a web scraping framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet. It appears to be a typical setup for a scraping script.",
