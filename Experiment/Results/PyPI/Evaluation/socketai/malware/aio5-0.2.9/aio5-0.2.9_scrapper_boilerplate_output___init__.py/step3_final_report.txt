  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging messages and printing dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'message', 'log', and 'dictionary' provide input data.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to stdout via print() and logs messages using the logging module; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are directly printed or logged; no external data flows or untrusted data processing beyond parameter passing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard usage of logging and printing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: 'log' for printing messages and logging at different levels, and 'print_dict' for printing dictionary items. It uses the standard logging module without configuration, which is typical for utility code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions perform basic output operations without external data fetching, network activity, or code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code does not process untrusted input in a risky manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for logging and printing, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
