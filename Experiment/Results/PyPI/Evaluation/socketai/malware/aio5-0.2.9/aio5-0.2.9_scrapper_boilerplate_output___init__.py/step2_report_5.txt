  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions for logging and printing dictionaries.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are identified.\n- The functions do not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, code execution, or access sensitive data.\n- The use of the logging module is standard, with no configuration issues noted.\n- No anomalies or unusual data flows are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is very simple and does not include any complex or risky operations.\n- The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n- The security risk is also appropriately scored as 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential concerns or points to challenge:**\n- The only minor issue is that the logging module is used without explicit configuration. While not malicious, this could lead to logs not being captured as intended if the environment isn't configured properly. However, this is a standard utility pattern and not a security concern.\n- The code does not sanitize input, but for a utility module, this is typical and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign utility code with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
