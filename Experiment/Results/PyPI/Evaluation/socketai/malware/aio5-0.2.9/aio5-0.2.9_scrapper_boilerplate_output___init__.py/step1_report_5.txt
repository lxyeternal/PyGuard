{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for logging messages and printing dictionaries, aimed at facilitating debugging and output display.",
  "sources": "User-provided message input in log() function, and dictionary input in print_dict() function.",
  "sinks": "Logging output may be directed to log files or console; no external data sinks are directly involved in the code.",
  "flows": "Message input → log() function → log method based on log level; dictionary keys/values → print_dict() → either log() or print() output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual or obfuscated patterns. Usage of standard logging and printing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: log() for logging messages at various levels, and print_dict() for printing dictionary contents. Both functions use standard Python methods. The log() function can output messages to console or log files depending on configuration, but there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious side effects. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, structured, and adheres to common practices. There are no anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code's purpose appears benign, focusing on logging and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, primarily serving as utility functions for logging and printing data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
