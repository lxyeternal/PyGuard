{
  "purpose": "Provide simple logging and dictionary printing functionalities for debugging or informational output.",
  "sources": "Input data: message parameter in log(), dictionary parameter in print_dict().",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to error, debug, warning, or info log levels; console output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input message/dictionary flows to print() or logging methods; logs are written to console or log files (if configured).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The logging levels are used conventionally; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward logging and dictionary printing functions. It uses Python's standard logging module and print statements. No external data sources or untrusted input processing beyond function parameters are present. The functions do not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The design appears typical for utility functions with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides basic logging and dictionary printing functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard utility code with minimal security concerns.",
