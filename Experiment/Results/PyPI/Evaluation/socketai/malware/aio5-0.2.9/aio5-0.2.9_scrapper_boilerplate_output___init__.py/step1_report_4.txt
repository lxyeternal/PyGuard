{
  "purpose": "Provide logging and pretty-printing functionality for dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: message, log, dictionary, logger",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (logging.error, logging.debug, logging.warning, logging.info) which write to logs or output streams",
  "flows": "Input parameters → log() or print_dict() → logging functions or print statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; no suspicious data flows or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for logging and printing dictionaries. It uses standard logging calls without dynamic execution, external data fetching, or hidden behaviors. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious side-effects are present. The use of print statements and logging functions appears benign and for debugging or info purposes. No suspicious data leaks or injection points are evident. The code’s structure and flow are straightforward and standard for logging utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected logging and printing tasks without suspicious operations.",
