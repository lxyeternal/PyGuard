  "purpose": "Provides simple logging and dictionary printing functions for debugging and informational output.",
  "sources": "User-provided message input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Output to console (print) and to logging handlers via logging module.",
  "flows": "Input message -> print; message -> logging methods based on log level.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'log' and 'print_dict'. 'log' outputs messages to console and optionally logs them at different levels without any data validation or transformation. 'print_dict' prints dictionary items, optionally using the 'log' function for each item. No untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward logging and printing utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. They do not perform any insecure operations or contain malicious behavior.",
