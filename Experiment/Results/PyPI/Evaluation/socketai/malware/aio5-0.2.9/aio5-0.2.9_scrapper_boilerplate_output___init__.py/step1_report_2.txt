  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging messages and printing dictionaries with optional logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'message', 'log', and 'dictionary' in functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into print and logging functions without modification or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The logging setup does not initialize or configure logging handlers, which could cause errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'log' and 'print_dict'. The 'log' function prints messages directly to stdout and conditionally logs them using the logging module based on the 'log' parameter. The 'print_dict' function prints dictionary items either directly or via the 'log' function if 'logger' is True. No input sanitization or validation is performed, but this is typical for simple utility functions. The logging module is used without configuration, but this is not inherently malicious. There are no code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply prints messages and logs them conditionally. No security risks or malware are present based on this analysis.",
