  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file processing, including removing duplicates, converting JSON/CSV to Excel, loading JSON data, and saving data to HTML, CSV, or Excel formats.",
  "sources": "File reads for 'raw_profile.txt', '{file_text}.txt', '{json_name}.json', and input data via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "File writes for 'profiles.txt', JSON files, Excel files, HTML files, and CSV files; potential for data exfiltration or overwriting sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (sources) into in-memory data structures, then to file writes (sinks), with no evident external network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Functionality appears standard for data processing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data manipulation functions involving reading from and writing to files, with no external network activity or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flows are detected. All functions serve common data processing purposes, and there are no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of standard utility functions for file and data management without malicious behavior. No indicators of malware, malicious data leaks, or security risks are present.",
