  "sources": "Reading from 'raw_profile.txt', 'profiles.txt', JSON files, CSV files, and potentially input data in function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files ('profiles.txt', JSON files, Excel files, HTML files, CSV files).",
  "flows": "Data is read from text files or input parameters, processed or normalized in memory, and then written to output files in various formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets. The functions are standard for data handling; no obfuscated or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward file I/O operations, data normalization, and format conversions using pandas and json modules. The functions seem designed for legitimate data processing tasks without any signs of malicious behavior. No network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All data handling appears to be local and intended for benign purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a set of utility functions for data processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates on local files, converting and cleaning data as expected. No malware indicators or suspicious activities are detected.",
