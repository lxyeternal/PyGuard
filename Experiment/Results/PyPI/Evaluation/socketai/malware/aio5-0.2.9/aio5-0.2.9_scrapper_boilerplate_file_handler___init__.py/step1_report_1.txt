  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file manipulation and data conversion, including removing duplicates, saving data to JSON, converting JSON and CSV files to Excel, loading JSON data, saving data to HTML, and converting dictionaries to CSV or Excel.",
  "sources": "File reading operations such as reading 'raw_profile.txt', 'links.txt', JSON files, and CSV files.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files ('profiles.txt', JSON, HTML, CSV, Excel).",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (sources) into in-memory data structures, then potentially to file outputs via write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No clear malicious behavior or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file and data format conversions using common libraries (json, pandas, os). Functions include removing duplicate lines from a text file, saving data to JSON, converting JSON and CSV to Excel, and saving data to HTML. No external network activity, code injection, or credential handling is observed. The functions are straightforward and use common patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data handling with no indicators of malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended solely for data processing and format conversions. No malware or security risks are evident.",
