{
  "purpose": "A simple utility function that introduces a randomized delay, optionally displaying the wait time.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'start', 'end', and 'display'; internal calls to 'randint' and 'sleep'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'randint' generates delay -> 'sleep' pauses execution; optional print for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard modules to generate a random delay within specified bounds, with an optional print statement. No external data, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The function's purpose is benign, such as simulating latency or pacing execution. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward delay utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
