  "purpose": "Generate a random delay time between specified start and end values, optionally displaying the wait time.",
  "sources": "User or external triggers calling generate_random_time() function, with optional display parameter for output.",
  "sinks": "The sleep() function, which causes the program to pause for the randomly generated duration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (start, end, display) -> generate_random_time() -> randint() for random number -> sleep() for delay; optional print if display=True.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward delay implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (random and time), defines a function that generates a random integer within given bounds, optionally prints a message, and then pauses execution for that duration. No user input is directly read inside the function, and no untrusted data flow is evident. The code performs a simple delay and has no side effects related to data leakage, backdoors, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for creating a randomized delay with optional output. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, straightforward delay function.",
