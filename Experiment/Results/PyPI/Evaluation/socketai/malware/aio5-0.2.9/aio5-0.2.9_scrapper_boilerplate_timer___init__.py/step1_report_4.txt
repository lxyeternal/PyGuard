{
  "purpose": "The function generates a random sleep duration within a specified range and optionally displays the wait time.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (start, end, display), and generates a random integer using randint.",
  "sinks": "Calls sleep() with the generated random time, causing the program to pause.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> randint -> sleep() (delay), optionally print -> sleep.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (random, time). Defines a function to generate a random delay within a range, with an optional print statement. No external data sources or outputs. No insecure practices or malicious behaviors detected. The sleep function causes a delay but does not pose security risks. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for simulating wait times.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for delaying execution randomly with optional display. No malicious or security-threatening behavior observed.",
