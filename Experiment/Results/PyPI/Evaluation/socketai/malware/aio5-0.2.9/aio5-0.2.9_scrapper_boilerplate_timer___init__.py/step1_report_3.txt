  "purpose": "Generate a random sleep duration between specified start and end times, optionally displaying the wait time.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'start', 'end', 'display'; usage of 'randint' and 'sleep' functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'sleep' function call which pauses execution for a random duration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → 'randint' to generate random time → 'sleep' to pause execution; optional print statement for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions for random number generation and sleeping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to pause execution for a random amount of time between 'start' and 'end' seconds. It imports 'randint' from the 'random' module and 'sleep' from the 'time' module. The function optionally prints the wait time if 'display' is True. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code performs a simple, benign delay operation without any data leakage, system modification, or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a delay with optional display. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be safe.",
