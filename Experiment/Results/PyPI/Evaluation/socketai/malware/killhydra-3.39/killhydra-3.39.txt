      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, with error suppression and conditional logic. These behaviors are typical of malicious or backdoor code in supply chain attacks. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified by these indicators. Further analysis, such as decoding the PowerShell command, is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
