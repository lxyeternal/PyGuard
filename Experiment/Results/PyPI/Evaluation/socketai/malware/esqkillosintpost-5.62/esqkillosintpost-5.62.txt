      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. The suspicious obfuscation, silent execution, and external URL point to a supply chain security threat. The scores across reports are appropriate, and the overall risk is high. This package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
