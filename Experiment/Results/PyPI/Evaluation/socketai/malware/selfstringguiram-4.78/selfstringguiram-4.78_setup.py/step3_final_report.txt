{
  "purpose": "Execute a conditional, obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of 'tahg' directory/file; the encoded PowerShell command is embedded within subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes an obfuscated PowerShell command, which could download, run malicious payloads, or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> if absent, executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> command runs silently, possibly malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand; broad try/except blocks hiding errors; suspicious URL comment; execution only when 'tahg' absent.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, which is suspicious. The broad exception handling conceals errors. The URL comment and encoded command suggest malicious intent. Scores across reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscated ~0.9, risk ~0.75) are consistent with this suspicion. Without decoding the command, certainty is limited, but the obfuscation and context justify high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated command execution, hidden errors, and suspicious comments. It warrants further decoding of the PowerShell command to confirm malicious intent. The package should be flagged for security review.",
