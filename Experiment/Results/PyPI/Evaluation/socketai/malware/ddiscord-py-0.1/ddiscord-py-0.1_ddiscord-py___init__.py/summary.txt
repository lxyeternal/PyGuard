  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and potential dynamic execution patterns, raising moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The risk and malware scores should reflect this cautious stance, with a higher obfuscation score. Overall, the code warrants careful review before deployment."
