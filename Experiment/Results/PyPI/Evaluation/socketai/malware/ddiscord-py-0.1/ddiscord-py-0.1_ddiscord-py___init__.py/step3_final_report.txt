  "purpose": "Analyze the provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external library calls, dynamic execution functions (e.g., eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., input, environment) to sinks via variable assignments, function calls, or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ambiguous variable names, dynamic code execution, obfuscation patterns, hardcoded secrets, suspicious external library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation with ambiguous variable names and dynamic execution functions, indicating potential concealment of malicious intent. No explicit data leaks or network activity are visible, but the suspicious patterns warrant caution. The absence of hardcoded secrets or direct malicious actions suggests moderate concern. The code's structure and patterns justify a moderate malware and security risk score, with high obfuscation suspicion. The confidence level is moderate due to limited code visibility but suspicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and potential dynamic execution patterns, raising moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The risk and malware scores should reflect this cautious stance, with a higher obfuscation score. Overall, the code warrants careful review before deployment.",
