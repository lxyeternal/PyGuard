      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command during setup. The behavior aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks and malware delivery. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious and avoid installation until the embedded command is decoded and analyzed for payload content."
