      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious intent. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk categories are justified based on the observed behavior. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, this package should be treated as potentially malicious."
