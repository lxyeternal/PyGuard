  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which is a common tactic in malicious payloads or backdoors. The setup process appears benign, but the hidden command execution significantly elevates the security concern. The high scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
