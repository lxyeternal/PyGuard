{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be designed to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are the data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no actual data sinks or external calls in the provided code; the function body is empty.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters to nowhere, as the function body does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation, which could be suspicious if it was expected to perform messaging operations. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters, but the body is empty ('pass'), indicating no operation occurs. This could be a placeholder or incomplete implementation. There are no external data accesses, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns detected. The absence of code within the function makes it impossible to evaluate operational behavior or identify malicious intent within the function itself. However, as it stands, it does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder for a messaging function with no implementation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet alone. It appears benign but incomplete.",
