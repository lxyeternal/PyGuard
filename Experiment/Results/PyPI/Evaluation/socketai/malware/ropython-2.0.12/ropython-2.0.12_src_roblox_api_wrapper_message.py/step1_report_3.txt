{
  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "The function body is empty; potential sinks could be where the message is transmitted or stored",
  "flows": "Data flows from user, recipient, and message parameters into the send function, but since the body is empty, no flow occurs",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation; no malicious behavior evident, but lack of implementation may hide malicious intent if used improperly",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but contains no implementation. There are no data processing, external calls, or operations that could be malicious. The function is likely a placeholder, which could be used maliciously if replaced with harmful code later, but as-is, it shows no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a stub with no operational logic, thus no malicious behavior is present. Its security risk is minimal but warrants monitoring if replaced or modified.",
