  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended for sending messages between users",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input data",
  "sinks": "No sinks; function body is empty, so no data processing or external interactions occur",
  "flows": "No data flows; function is a stub with no operational code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple placeholder with no implementation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty 'send' function with parameters suggesting messaging intent. All reports correctly identify it as a placeholder with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious code. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward code. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the placeholder nature but acknowledging potential future misuse if replaced. No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent is present in the current code. The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete placeholder with no malicious or obfuscated content. The current security risk is very low, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action is necessary unless the code is replaced with actual messaging logic, which should then be re-evaluated.",
