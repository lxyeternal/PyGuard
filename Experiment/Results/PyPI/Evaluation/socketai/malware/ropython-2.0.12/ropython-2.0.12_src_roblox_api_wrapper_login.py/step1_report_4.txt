{
  "purpose": "The code defines placeholder functions intended for login operations to the roblox.com API.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie' for cookielogin; 'username' and 'password' for userpasslogin.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or output occurs as the functions are unimplemented.",
  "flows": "No data flows since functions do not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty and do not perform any logic; no secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides function signatures for login mechanisms but contains no implementation or data handling. No sources, sinks, or flows are active. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. Given the lack of implementation, it cannot be used maliciously or securely evaluated beyond acknowledging its placeholder nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal stub with no operational logic, malicious activity, or security risks. It does not perform any actions and appears to be a scaffold for future development.",
