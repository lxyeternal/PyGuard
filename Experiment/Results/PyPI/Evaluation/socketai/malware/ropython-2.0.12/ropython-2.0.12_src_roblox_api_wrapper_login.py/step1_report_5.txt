  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox API login operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' as inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing is present; functions currently do nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious code or behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two login functions intended for Roblox API access, but both functions lack any implementation. There are no data manipulations, no network calls, no hardcoded credentials, and no unusual or suspicious logic. As such, it appears to be boilerplate or placeholder code without malicious intent or security concerns. The absence of actual code makes it impossible for malicious behavior or security risks to be present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is merely placeholder definitions with no operational content; there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign stub that requires implementation to perform any login actions.",
