  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the functions are currently empty and do not process data further",
  "flows": "No data flows occur since the functions are unimplemented and do not perform any operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code activities are present; functions are placeholders with no logic, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains two function definitions intended for login operations but lacks implementation. There are no processing steps, no data handling, or external communications. The functions do not perform any operations, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely placeholder functions with no active logic or security issues. It does not pose any malware or security risks in its current form.",
