  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (inputs), but no data is processed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; functions do nothing.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions are unimplemented stubs with no logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions with 'pass' statements, indicating placeholders. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are straightforward and unobfuscated. Given the absence of logic, no suspicious patterns or security issues are evident. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the lack of active code, data flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign placeholder functions with no active behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the reports correctly interpret the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
