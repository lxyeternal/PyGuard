{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox API login procedures, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; functions do not perform any operations",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing occurs within these functions",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two empty function definitions meant for login purposes. There are no operations, data processing, or network activity. The functions are placeholders without implementation. No source-to-sink data flows are present, and no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident. This minimal structure suggests the code is either incomplete or intentionally stubbed out.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal template with no active logic or malicious behavior. It presents no security risks or malware at this stage, as it only defines empty functions without executing any code.",
