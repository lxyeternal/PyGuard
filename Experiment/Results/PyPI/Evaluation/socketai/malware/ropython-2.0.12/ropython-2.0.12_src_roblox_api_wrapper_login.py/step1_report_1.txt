  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login to Roblox API, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "No active data sinks; functions are empty and do not process or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions do nothing",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides two stub functions for login mechanisms but does not perform any operations. No data is read, processed, or transmitted. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The functions may be placeholders for future implementation but, as is, they do not pose any threat or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign placeholder functions with no active behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies.",
