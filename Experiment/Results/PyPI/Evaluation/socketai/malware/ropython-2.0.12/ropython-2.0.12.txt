      "conclusion": "The package's active code is safe, but the commented-out base64 payloads pose a latent security threat if activated. The high obfuscation and embedded URLs indicate potential malicious intent. The malware score should be around 0.75, the obfuscation score approximately 0.85, and the overall security risk about 0.75, reflecting the possibility of remote code execution and data exfiltration if the payloads are uncommented and run."

The import of 'requests' suggests potential future network activity but is harmless in its current unused state. The function does not perform any operations or data leaks. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is effectively 0."

No further action is necessary unless the code is replaced with actual messaging logic, which should then be re-evaluated."
