  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete stub with no malicious behavior or security risks at present. The import of 'requests' suggests potential future network activity but is harmless in its current unused state. The function does not perform any operations or data leaks. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is effectively 0."
