      "conclusion": "This package contains highly suspicious, potentially malicious code designed to conceal its intent and execute external scripts during installation. The remote script download and eval() usage are critical indicators of malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The obfuscation techniques further support a high obfuscation score (~0.9). Overall, this code poses a severe security threat and should be considered malicious."
