{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'maratlib' with some obfuscated string manipulations, and it executes a shell command to download and run an external script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the sys.version_info object, obfuscated strings in the l111_cringe_ function, and it also executes a system command via os.system().",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the os.system() call which executes a remote script downloaded from the internet, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.version_info is used in the obfuscation function; however, the critical flow of concern is the system call that downloads and executes an external script, which is a direct sink to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code using character shifts and eval() indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code downloads a script from a suspicious URL and executes it without validation, which is highly anomalous. Use of eval() with obfuscated strings is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a version check and an obfuscated function that manipulates strings with character shifts and eval(), suggesting intentional concealment of functionality. The critical operation is the os.system() call, which downloads and executes a remote shell script from 'https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza-ob.sh'. This remote script could contain malicious commands. The setup() function includes obfuscated description and author_email fields, likely hiding additional malicious or misleading information. The obfuscation and remote code execution point to malicious intent or at least a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code and executes a remote shell script without validation, indicating malicious behavior or a severe security risk. It aims to conceal its true purpose and actively downloads external code for execution, which is highly suspicious.",
