{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python setup script that includes obfuscated functions and an external command to download and execute a shell script, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The external command executed via os.system to wget and run a remote script; obfuscated function l111_cringe_ which processes data and uses eval.",
  "sinks": "The system call to download and execute a remote shell script; eval function executing obfuscated code, possibly malicious.",
  "flows": "The code uses obfuscated decoding function to execute code dynamically, then runs a shell command to fetch and run a remote script, indicating a flow from obfuscated data processing to executing external malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function with dynamic eval, unusual variable names, direct download and execution of a remote shell script, use of eval on decoded string, and obfuscated string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with an obfuscated function that decodes and evaluates a string, which might contain malicious code. It then immediately executes a system command to download a shell script from a suspicious GitHub URL and runs it with root permissions. The setup call appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious download and execution step. The obfuscation and external script download strongly suggest malicious intent or compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external shell script from a remote source. The obfuscation and eval usage further increase suspicion. The package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
