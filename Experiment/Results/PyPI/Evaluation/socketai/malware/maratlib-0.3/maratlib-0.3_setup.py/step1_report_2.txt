{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to obfuscate some functionality and then perform a setup process that includes downloading and executing a remote script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the command line via sys.version_info, and it executes a system command to download and run a remote script from GitHub.",
  "sinks": "The system command executes a remote shell script from an external server, which could potentially contain malicious code. The eval() function is used to evaluate obfuscated code, which is a significant security concern.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated function decodes and executes code at runtime, likely leading to the execution of the remote script fetched via wget, then proceeds to setup a package with potentially obfuscated description and author_email fields.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function that decodes and evaluates code dynamically, and a remote script download and execution in the setup process. Usage of eval on decoded strings suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with obfuscated code that likely decodes a payload and executes it via eval, which is a common technique for malware or malicious scripts. The code then uses os.system to download a shell script from a suspicious GitHub URL and executes it, which is highly dangerous. The setup() call uses obfuscated strings for description and author_email, further indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall structure, including obfuscation and remote code execution, points to malicious behavior or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated decoding logic and performs a remote download and execution of a shell script, which is a high indicator of malicious activity. The use of eval with dynamically decoded strings and remote code execution suggests malicious intent. This package should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
