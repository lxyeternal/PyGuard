{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to obfuscate its true intent and execute a remote shell script during package setup, indicating malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the obfuscated string manipulations and the sys.version_info check; the remote script is fetched via wget during setup.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function executes dynamically decoded code; the os.system() call downloads and runs a remote script, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded and evaluated via eval(), which is triggered during setup; the system call downloads and executes external code; the decoded strings in setup() are also derived from obfuscated data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on obfuscated strings, dynamic character shifting, and execution of a remote script during package installation are highly unusual and suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code employs heavy obfuscation with character shifting and unicode manipulations, culminating in eval() execution of decoded strings. During setup, it runs a system command that downloads and executes a remote shell script from a suspicious URL. The obfuscated strings for description and author_email are decoded at runtime, concealing potentially malicious information. The combination of eval(), remote code download, and obfuscation techniques strongly indicates malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The high use of obfuscation and remote execution points to a high security risk and malware likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains highly suspicious, potentially malicious code designed to conceal its intent and execute external scripts during installation. The remote script download and eval() usage are critical indicators of malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The obfuscation techniques further support a high obfuscation score (~0.9). Overall, this code poses a severe security threat and should be considered malicious.",
