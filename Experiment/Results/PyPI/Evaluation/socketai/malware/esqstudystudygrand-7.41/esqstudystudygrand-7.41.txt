      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, with silent error handling and a suspicious comment. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, posing a significant security risk. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious activity. Immediate mitigation or removal is recommended."
