  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client or library that facilitates proxy connections, including importing relevant modules and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted input or data leakage points are present",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and exposes functions and classes; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. The version string is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and classes related to proxy connection handling and defines the __all__ list for exports. It sets a version string and maintains a clean, straightforward structure. No code execution, data processing, or network activity occurs here. It appears to be a simple interface or package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface file with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It simply organizes and exports components of a proxy library.",
