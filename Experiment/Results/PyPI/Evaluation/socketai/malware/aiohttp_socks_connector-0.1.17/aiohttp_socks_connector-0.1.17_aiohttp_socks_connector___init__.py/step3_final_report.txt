{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing internal components and defining the public API for a proxy connection library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from internal module imports (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup, importing classes, functions, and constants, then exposing them via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The version string is a standard metadata attribute. The structure resembles a typical __init__.py file for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple API surface for a proxy connection library. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk detected. The scores should reflect this.",
