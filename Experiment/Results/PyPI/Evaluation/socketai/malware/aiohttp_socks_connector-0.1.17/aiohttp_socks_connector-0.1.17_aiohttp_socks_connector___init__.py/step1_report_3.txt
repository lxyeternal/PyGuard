{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, exporting various classes, functions, and error definitions related to SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data processing or output is evident in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports from modules, then exports symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources or data manipulation observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors identified; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of importing classes and functions from local modules and defining the module's public API. There are no external inputs, user data, or dynamic execution mechanisms present. The structure suggests a standard Python package initialization or module file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code appears safe and typical for a library component.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module initialization file for a Python library dealing with proxy connections. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The code is safe and seems intended for exposing the library's functionality.",
