  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a straightforward Python module, primarily importing classes, functions, and constants from internal modules and defining the module's public API via `__all__`.\n- There is a version string, `__version__ = \"0.1.2\"`.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or package setup file for a proxy-related library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Confirmed as a simple module setup with no malicious intent.  \n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, confirming a package initializer.  \n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct; benign code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, a module exporting proxy connection classes.  \n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same pattern, module setup for proxy connection library.  \n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero), confidence: 1.  \n- **Analysis:** The slight security risk score might be due to the mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimation. No actual security issue exists.  \n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score should be 0, aligning with the other reports and the code content.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar, module for proxy connection, no malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely import/export setup with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None detected; the code is standard and benign.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, except report 4, which has a slightly elevated security risk score of 0.1. This appears unjustified based on the code.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** No evidence supports a risk higher than 0.0. The code is a benign package initializer.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** None. The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 across all, including report 4, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign package setup file with no malicious or security issues. The only discrepancy is the security risk score of 0.1 in report 4, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's nature.",
