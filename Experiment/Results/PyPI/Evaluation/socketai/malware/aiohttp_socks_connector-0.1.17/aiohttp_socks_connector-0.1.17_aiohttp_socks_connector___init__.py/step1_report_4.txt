{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, defining imports and exporting modules for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are evident; no external data processing or untrusted input handling shown",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; likely in the imported modules which are not included",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and appears to be a module setup with no malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports components from local modules and defines metadata (__version__, __all__). No external network calls, data handling, or suspicious operations are present in this snippet. It functions as an export interface for a proxy connection package, which itself could be part of a larger proxy system. Since no input/output handling or dynamic code execution is visible, no malicious activity can be inferred. The structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues based on this snippet alone.",
