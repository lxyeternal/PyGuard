{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for a Python package related to proxy connections, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; package version declaration",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; simple module setup with no runtime logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, error class definitions, and exports, establishing the module's API. There are no runtime behaviors, external data reads, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be a typical package initialization file, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a standard package interface setup for proxy-related functionality. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
