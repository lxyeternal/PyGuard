  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the reasoning therein.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization or interface file, primarily importing and exporting classes, functions, and constants.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or runtime logic is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard Python module setup for a proxy connection library.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is just import/export setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.5 (given as 0).  \n  **Justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, a security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n  **Justification:** No security risk or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; straightforward package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n  **Justification:** Slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, this is acceptable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1.  \n  **Justification:** Again, minimal risk, consistent with the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n  **Justification:** No evidence of risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is justified. Slight deviations to 0.1 in some reports are acceptable but not necessary.\n\n**Potential overestimations:**  \n- The only minor point is in Report 4, which assigns a securityRisk of 0.1. While not wrong, it might be more accurate to set it to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with only minor room for adjusting the securityRisk to zero.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
