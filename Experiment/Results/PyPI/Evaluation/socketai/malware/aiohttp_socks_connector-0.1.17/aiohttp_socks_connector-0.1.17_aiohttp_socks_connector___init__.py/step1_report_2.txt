{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be a package that exports various classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections, errors, and helpers, likely for use in establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code primarily defines and exports classes, constants, and functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected; code structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines the __version__ and __all__ variables for package exports. It appears to serve as an initialization file for a package related to SOCKS proxy handling. There is no dynamic code execution, network communication, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward package initializer that imports and exposes functionalities from internal modules. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a benign part of a larger proxy-related package.",
