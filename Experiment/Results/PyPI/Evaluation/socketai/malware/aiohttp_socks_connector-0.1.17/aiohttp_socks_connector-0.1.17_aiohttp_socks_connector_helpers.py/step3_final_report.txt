{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "URL input for proxy configuration, host and port parameters, user credentials from URL or function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URLs and credentials used to create socket connections, which could be exploited if malicious inputs are supplied.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and parameters are parsed and validated, then used to instantiate socket wrappers, which connect to proxies and forward data to target hosts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Input validation is standard; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection setup using external libraries, with proper validation and exception handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present. The functions rely on user-supplied URLs and parameters, which could be misused but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical proxy connection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious features. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given its utility nature and potential for misuse if inputs are malicious. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
