  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs, user inputs for host, port, and proxy URL, and function parameters for connection details.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers, connecting to proxies, and establishing network connections via asyncio methods.",
  "flows": "Input data such as proxy URL and connection parameters flow through parsing functions into socket wrapper creation, then into connection functions that establish network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code relies on user-supplied parameters for sensitive data. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are used. Proxy URLs are parsed to extract credentials, but no validation beyond URL structure is performed. No logging or data exfiltration code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio. It includes functions for parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers based on proxy type, and establishing connections via those wrappers. It validates input parameters for host and port, and raises appropriate exceptions if inputs are invalid or missing. The proxy URL parsing extracts username and password without any apparent malicious intent. The socket creation and connection process is standard and uses well-known libraries. No external or hidden network communications, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are evident. The use of asyncio for asynchronous connections is appropriate and does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for proxy connection management without any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. It is well-structured, with proper input validation and exception handling. No security risks or anomalies are detected that would suggest malicious intent or sabotage.",
