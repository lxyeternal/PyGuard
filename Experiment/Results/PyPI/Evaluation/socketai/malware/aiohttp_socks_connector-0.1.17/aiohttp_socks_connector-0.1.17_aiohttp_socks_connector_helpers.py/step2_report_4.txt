  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It includes URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`aiohttp_socks_connector`, `yarl`) and standard Python modules.\n- The input validation (host, port, URL parsing) is appropriate.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, with proper validation and exception handling.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Low, mainly due to reliance on user input for sensitive data, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is legitimate, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence (0.9) seems justified. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard proxy connection code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy handling with URL parsing.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Standard functions, proper validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 seems appropriate given the context—user-controlled inputs, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code could potentially be misused if malicious URLs or credentials are supplied, but that is inherent to any proxy code accepting user input.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (consistent with reports and analysis)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (standard risk level for user-supplied parameters, no specific vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
