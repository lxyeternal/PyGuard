{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting URL parsing and asynchronous connection handling.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs, reading host, port, username, and password; receiving connection parameters; obtaining event loop.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket connections, opening network connections with specified host and port, establishing proxy connections.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing and data from parameters flow into socket creation, then into connection establishment functions, ultimately creating network connections via proxies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and legitimate proxy connection techniques. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides legitimate functions for creating SOCKS proxy sockets and opening connections asynchronously. Proxy URL parsing extracts host, port, username, and password securely. Connection functions ensure proper parameter validation and utilize standard asyncio mechanisms. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data leaks identified. The code appears to implement standard proxy connection procedures without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection operations with proper parameter validation and URL parsing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the code provided.",
