  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections, with input parameters including URL, host, port, and credentials.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is straightforward, uses external libraries appropriately, and shows no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is standard for proxy connection management. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing socket creation and connection via SOCKS proxies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The code relies on trusted libraries and validates inputs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with Report 1. No malicious activity detected. The scoring appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The flow is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is standard for proxy handling. The risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for SOCKS proxies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, proper validation, and standard library usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo concerns here. The code's purpose and implementation are typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for SOCKS proxy management, parsing URLs, and establishing connections.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code relies on user input and standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is present and functional as described.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily because the code performs proxy connection setup without any malicious features.\n- **Score Justification:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are reasonable given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or security flaws evident.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) reflects the potential for misuse if user inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n- Obfuscation remains at 0, consistent with the clear and straightforward code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, considering potential misuse of proxy parameters but no inherent maliciousness)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
