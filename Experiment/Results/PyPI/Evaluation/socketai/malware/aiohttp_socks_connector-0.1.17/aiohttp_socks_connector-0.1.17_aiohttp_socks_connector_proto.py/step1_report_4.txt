{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, supporting negotiation, authentication, and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostname, port, user credentials, and data received from network socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over the network socket via sock_sendall, including proxy requests, authentication data, and DNS resolutions. Data received via sock_recv and network responses from the proxy server.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into connection and authentication routines, then into socket operations; responses from the proxy server are read and interpreted to determine connection success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No use of obfuscated code. No external suspicious network domains or commands are present. The code primarily performs standard proxy negotiation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients for asyncio-based Python applications. It performs hostname resolution, socket connection, proxy negotiation, and optional authentication, all within expected patterns. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The error handling is appropriate for network operations. The logic for handling different address types and authentication methods is standard and does not include any malicious or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation for asyncio environments. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It performs expected network proxy functions without suspicious anomalies.",
