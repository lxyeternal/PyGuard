{
  "purpose": "Implementation of asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket connections, hostnames for address resolution, and user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Sends and receives data over network sockets, including proxy negotiation and data forwarding.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication steps, then to proxy negotiation, and finally to data transmission between client and destination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy client logic with proper error handling, address resolution, and authentication procedures. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command injection, or network manipulation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
