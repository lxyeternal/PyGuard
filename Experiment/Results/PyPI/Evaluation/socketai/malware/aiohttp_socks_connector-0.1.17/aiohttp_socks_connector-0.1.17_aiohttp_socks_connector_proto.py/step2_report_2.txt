  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scoring justification, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious flows. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning aligns with the code: standard proxy client logic, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration signals. The scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard behavior, no malicious intent, and proper error handling. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The detailed reasoning supports the low malware and risk scores. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy client with no malicious features, proper error handling, and legitimate use of socket operations. Malware score is 0, risk score 0.2.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Again, a typical SOCKS proxy implementation with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation. The focus is on standard network operations, with no malicious signals. Malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No score adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The code performs standard proxy connection handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Malware score 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis is consistent; no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting typical network proxy code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, typical for network utility code)\n\n**Given the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores.** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evident security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThese reflect a low-risk, benign utility code with no signs of compromise or malicious behavior.",
