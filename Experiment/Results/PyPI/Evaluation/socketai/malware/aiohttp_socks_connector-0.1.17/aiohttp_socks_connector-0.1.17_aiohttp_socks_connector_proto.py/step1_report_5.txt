{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to enable proxy connections in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, socket responses, and network address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations (sock_sendall, sock_recv, sock_connect), which can send and receive data over the network, including potentially malicious data if the server behaves maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) to network sockets via the connect and negotiate methods, with responses processed to establish proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard proxy implementation logic with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or code injection are present. The handling of credentials (username/password) appears legitimate, and the network operations follow expected patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with methods for resolving addresses, authenticating, and establishing connections via proxies. It uses standard Python socket and asyncio features for non-blocking network operations. No suspicious or malicious code segments are evident. The code does not perform any external data exfiltration, command execution, or connect to unknown domains beyond proxy functionality. The only notable aspect is handling of proxy protocols, which is legitimate for proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected operations for proxy connection handling, with no suspicious signals or behaviors. Security risks are minimal, limited to normal network communication behavior.",
