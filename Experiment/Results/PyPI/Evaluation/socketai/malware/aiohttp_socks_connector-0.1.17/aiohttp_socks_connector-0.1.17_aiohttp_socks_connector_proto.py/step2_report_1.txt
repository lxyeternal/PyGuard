  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers. No suspicious behavior or backdoors detected. The code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, and no malicious activity is evident. The risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and reasoning. The risk score is even lower, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: legitimate SOCKS proxy client code, no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and implementation, these are reasonable.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior.\n\n- It uses standard libraries and patterns for SOCKS proxy handling.\n\n- No signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0, as code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's function as a proxy client, a low risk score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate. Slightly increasing it to 0.2 could be justified if considering potential misuse in malicious contexts, but as is, it's reasonable.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware            | **0**               |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**               |\n| Security Risk      | **0.2**             |\n\nThe current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments necessary.",
