{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous network connections, supporting negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as host, port, user credentials, and data received from network socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets; address resolution results are used for connecting; no direct sinks for untrusted input are evident outside network communication functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into connection and negotiation methods; network data flows from remote proxy servers; no evidence of untrusted data influencing critical logic beyond normal network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for proxy socket handling with proper error handling; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected; external modules are properly imported with checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy handling with asynchronous I/O, including connection, address resolution, and authentication. It handles various network scenarios and error conditions. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors, are present. The use of standard socket operations and asyncio ensures typical network behavior. External dependencies are imported conditionally with error handling, and no suspicious data manipulation is detected. The code functions as a network proxy client wrapper without malicious intent or security flaws based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asynchronous Python networking, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured network utility.",
