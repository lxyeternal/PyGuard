{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters (host, port, username, password), network data received via socket (in negotiate methods), and address resolution results.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the proxy server via _send; receives data via _receive; establishes socket connections with sock_connect; resolves addresses with getaddrinfo.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> socket connection -> negotiate() methods -> data sent/received through socket -> proxy server responses processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears standard for a proxy client implementation. No suspicious code flows or data leaks identified. Uses standard libraries for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with asynchronous socket handling. It resolves addresses, manages authentication, and establishes connections securely. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. No hidden code, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The only notable behavior is network data handling which is standard for proxy clients.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous Python networking. It does not exhibit malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided code. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack signals identified.",
