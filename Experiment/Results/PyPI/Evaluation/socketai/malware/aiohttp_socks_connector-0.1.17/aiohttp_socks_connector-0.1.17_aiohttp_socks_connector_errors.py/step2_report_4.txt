  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is solely class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No executable logic, data handling, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign setup for error handling in a larger proxy module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Issue presence in code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Security risk:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or malicious content.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- The confidence score of 1 across all reports is justified, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward class declarations with no suspicious patterns.\n- The conclusion that there's no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk is accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Any necessary adjustments?**\n- No. All scores and conclusions seem reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions, there's no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature and are consistent in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the evaluations. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
