  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues, serving as error handling framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class hierarchy with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors, with no executable logic, data handling, or network interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified. The confidence level of 1 reflects high certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless set of exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy modules. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
