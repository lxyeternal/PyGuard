  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No executable logic, data handling, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is consistently 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n   - **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of class definitions for exception handling. There are no issues such as malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n   - **No.** The reasoning is consistent, accurate, and aligns with the code content. The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Security risk (0):** Justified, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.  \n   - **Risk score (0):** Appropriate, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Not applicable here; all scores are 0, correctly reflecting the benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   - Correctly set to 0, as the code contains no malicious elements.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that these are simple class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   - All scores are consistent and justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Given the above, I concur with the reports' assessments.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is a standard, benign setup for exception handling in a SOCKS proxy context. No security concerns are present.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a safe, standard exception class hierarchy with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
