  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only declares exception classes without any data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a hierarchy of exception classes for SOCKS proxy-related errors. It does not include any input processing, network connections, or system modifications. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to serve as a standard exception framework for a larger proxy management module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of exception classes without any malicious intent or security concerns. It functions as part of a larger error-handling mechanism for SOCKS proxies. No anomalies or malware are present.",
