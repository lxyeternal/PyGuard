  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; just class definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class declarations without hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively declares custom exception classes for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no functions, data handling, or executable logic. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxies and connection errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard setup for exception handling.",
