  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data handling, network calls, or executable logic.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as part of an error handling framework.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code contains only class definitions for exceptions. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  The code is standard and correct for defining custom exceptions. No errors or flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.  \n  - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n  - **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of individual reports:\n\n- **Report 1-5:**  \n  All are consistent in their analysis, conclusion, and confidence (1). They correctly identify that these are standard exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n- **Any anomalies or suspicious claims?**  \n  None. All reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity or payloads.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
