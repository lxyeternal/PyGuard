{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy-related errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data read; class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; exception definitions are self-contained",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing; just class inheritance structures",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The classes are standard practice for error handling in network or proxy modules, and no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for SOCKS and proxy errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security concerns. It appears to be a normal, safe part of an error handling module.",
