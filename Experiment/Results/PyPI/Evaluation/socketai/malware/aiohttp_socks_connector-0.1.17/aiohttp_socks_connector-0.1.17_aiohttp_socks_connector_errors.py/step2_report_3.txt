  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the consistency of the findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code only defines exception classes; there are no functions, data handling, network calls, or executable logic.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are uniformly zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The reports correctly state that the code contains only class definitions, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Analysis of scores:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n   - Security risk: 0 is appropriate, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n   - Risk score: 0 for all reports, which makes sense given the benign nature.\n\n3. **Justification for higher scores:**\n   - None of the reports suggest or justify higher scores; all are consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Potential assumptions or claims:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that these are class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exception handling, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report is thorough and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
