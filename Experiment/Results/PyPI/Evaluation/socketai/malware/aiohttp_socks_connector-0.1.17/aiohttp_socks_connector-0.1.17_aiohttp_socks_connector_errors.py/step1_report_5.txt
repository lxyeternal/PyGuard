{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exception classes are defined statically within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input or output; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; all classes are standard exception subclasses with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors and connection errors. There are no inputs, no data handling, or any dynamic behavior. All classes inherit directly from standard exception classes, with no added code, attributes, or functions. The code appears to be part of a larger library or module for SOCKS proxy handling, focusing solely on exception classification. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as part of an error handling framework within a larger application.",
