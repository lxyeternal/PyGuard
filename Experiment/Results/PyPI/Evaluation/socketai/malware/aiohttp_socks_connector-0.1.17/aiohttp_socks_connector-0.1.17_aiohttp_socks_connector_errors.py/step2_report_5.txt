  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code solely defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No data processing, network calls, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, benign, and part of a larger error handling framework.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0, which seems appropriate given the content.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code does *not* contain any issues or vulnerabilities. It’s purely class definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The overall security risk is also 0, which is justified.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions for exceptions, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is present to warrant a higher score.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that there’s no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n**Summary and final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports’ conclusions. The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- No changes to the scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It’s a straightforward setup for exception handling in a SOCKS proxy context.",
