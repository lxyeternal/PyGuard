{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exception classes without any executable logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class declarations with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exceptions to be used in SOCKS proxy and general proxy error handling. It does not include any executable logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within these class definitions. The code appears to be a standard setup for error handling in a proxy-related module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in SOCKS and proxy contexts. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a benign component of a larger application.",
