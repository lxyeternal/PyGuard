  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing HTTP/HTTPS proxy connections, including resolving hostnames and establishing connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "User-provided proxy URL, user credentials, hostnames, and ports used in connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Connection establishment methods and URL formatting which could potentially leak credentials if improperly handled or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL and credentials -> parsed by from_url -> stored in class attributes -> used in proxy_url property -> utilized in connection wrapper and request setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles proxy configuration and connection management. It securely formats proxy URLs, optionally uses a custom resolver, and manages socket connections for HTTP and non-HTTP proxies. No input data is directly used for unsafe operations; credential handling appears standard. No indications of malicious intent or backdoors. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and does not include obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector for HTTP clients, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It handles proxy URLs and credentials appropriately without exposing or leaking sensitive data internally. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate proxy management.",
