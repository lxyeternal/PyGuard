  "purpose": "Provides a proxy connection handler for aiohttp, managing proxy URL construction, socket wrapping, and connection flow.",
  "sources": "Proxy credentials (host, port, username, password), proxy URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, connection requests.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL with embedded credentials, socket connections, network requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) used to generate proxy URL and socket connections; socket wrapper used for non-HTTP proxies; connection requests utilize proxy URL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Proxy URL exposes credentials if accessed, but this is standard and not inherently insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs proxy URLs dynamically, manages socket connections via a wrapper, and handles connection flow appropriately. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. External helper functions are assumed safe. The proxy URL exposes credentials but does not leak them. The socket wrapper's safety depends on its implementation, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk reflects typical concerns with credential handling but does not indicate malicious intent. No adjustments are necessary.",
