  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the presence of any issues, and the appropriateness of their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages proxy configuration and connection, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- The use of a custom resolver and socket wrapper is typical for proxy handling.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code analysis. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The securityRisk is minimal, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious patterns or hardcoded credentials.\n- Proxy URL creation and socket wrapping are standard.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment seems accurate. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connector with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code constructs proxy URLs dynamically, manages socket connections securely.\n- No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.\n- Socket wrappers could be a concern if malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n**Verdict:** The conclusion is consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements a typical aiohttp proxy connector, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code handles proxy configuration securely.\n- No suspicious code or backdoors.\n- The slightly lower securityRisk score reflects the standard nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connection setup, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code manages proxy settings and socket creation normally.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The securityRisk scores are low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are zero across all reports, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — Very low, consistent with the code's function.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The only potential concern could be the socket wrapper (`create_socket_wrapper`), which is external. If maliciously implemented, it could introduce risks. However, based on the provided code and reports, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The proxy URL handling involves credential formatting, but no leaks or unsafe practices are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risks, e.g., credential handling, but nothing malicious)\n\nThe overall assessment confirms that the code is safe, standard, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated components.",
