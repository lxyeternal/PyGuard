  "purpose": "The code extracts saved Chrome login credentials from the user's profile and sends them to a remote Discord webhook, potentially for malicious data theft.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database file",
    "Reading the 'Local State' file to obtain encrypted key",

  "flows": [
    "Read login data from Chrome SQLite database -> decrypt stored passwords -> write credentials to file -> send file via webhook"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "The code targets specific browser data paths and decrypts sensitive credentials without user consent",
    "Use of try-except blocks to suppress errors without logging",
    "Sending extracted data to an external server (webhook) without user awareness",
    "Repeated decryption attempts and fallback mechanisms suggest an intent to access as much data as possible"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script retrieves Chrome stored login credentials from the user's profile by accessing the 'Login Data' database and the 'Local State' file for encryption keys. It decrypts passwords using Windows cryptography APIs and AES decryption, then saves all credentials into a text file. Finally, it uploads this file to a remote Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. The code operates silently, suppressing errors, and targets user-specific directories, which aligns with typical credential theft behavior. Overall, the script functions as a credential stealer with remote exfiltration capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to extract stored Chrome passwords and send them to an attacker-controlled webhook, constituting a credential-stealing malware. It operates covertly, accessing sensitive user data without authorization.",
