{
  "purpose": "The script extracts saved passwords from Google Chrome's local storage, decrypts them, saves them to a file, and then uploads the file via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database and 'Local State' JSON file, and reads/writes 'passwords.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Uploads 'passwords.txt' file content to a Discord webhook via an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Extracts encrypted passwords from the database -> decrypts passwords -> writes data to 'passwords.txt' -> uploads file through webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The script bypasses user consent, automates extraction of sensitive data, and uploads it to a remote server, indicating malicious intent. Uses hardcoded webhook URL and local file paths. No user prompts or permissions checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses Chrome's stored login data and decrypts passwords using Windows-specific APIs. It then writes these passwords to a text file and immediately uploads this file to an external webhook URL, indicating data exfiltration. The process is automated without user awareness or consent. The code structure is straightforward but designed for malicious data theft, not legitimate functionality. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present, but the behavior is clearly malicious due to the unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious as it automatically extracts, decrypts, stores, and exfiltrates user passwords without consent, indicating clear malicious intent with high risk and malware likelihood.",
