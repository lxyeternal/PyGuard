      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious intent. The pattern of hidden execution, obfuscation, and external URL points to a significant security threat. The package should be treated as malicious until the encoded command is decoded and verified. High suspicion warrants caution and further analysis."
