{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, including files, environment variables, process list, and system details, then encodes and sends this data to an external server.",
  "sources": "File reads (/etc/passwd, logger.py, /etc/hosts), environment variables, directory listings, process list, user home directory files, /rasp directory, and system calls (os.uname, os.getcwd).",
  "sinks": "Encoded data sent via HTTP POST request to https://pypi.org/reqs?d= with custom headers, potentially for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data collected from sources is aggregated into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, base64 encoded, then sent over network via HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive collection of system files and information without clear purpose; commented-out code for external IP check; data collection appears broad and invasive; no validation or filtering of data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system information such as /etc/passwd, environment variables, process list, and directory contents. It encodes this data and transmits it to an external URL with a custom Host header, which could mask the destination. The collection of system files and process info without user consent suggests potential data exfiltration. No evident malicious payloads like remote code execution, backdoors, or malicious commands are present, but the data harvesting pattern is suspicious and privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect comprehensive system information and send it externally, which could be used maliciously for system profiling or data exfiltration. Although it does not contain explicit malware like remote shell or file damage, its behavior aligns with reconnaissance or privacy violation. Its intent is potentially malicious or at least highly privacy-invasive.",
