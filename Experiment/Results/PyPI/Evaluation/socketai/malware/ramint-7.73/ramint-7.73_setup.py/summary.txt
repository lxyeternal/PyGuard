  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating a high probability of malicious activity or backdoor. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but the current evidence warrants a high security concern."
