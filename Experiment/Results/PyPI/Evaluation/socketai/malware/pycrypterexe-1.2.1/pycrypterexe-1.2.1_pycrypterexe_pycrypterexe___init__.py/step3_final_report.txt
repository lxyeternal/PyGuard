  "purpose": "A trivial Python function that prints a static message, with a comment referencing an external URL.",
  "sources": "No external input, environment variables, or data sources; only a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external calls; no data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip' which appears to be a red herring or joke, not an actual malicious indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign function with no malicious or obfuscated logic. The comment referencing an external module does not translate into malicious activity within this snippet. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.1) due to the suspicious comment. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The mention of 'evilpip' is likely a red herring. Scores are consistent with the benign assessment; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
