{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed to extract system information, browser data, Wi-Fi passwords, and Discord tokens from a victim machine, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhook. It also includes reverse shell capabilities for remote control.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), system commands (netsh, dir), browser storage files (Chrome's Login Data, Cookies), network responses (icanhazip.com), and local files (Wi-Fi profiles, browser databases).",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook URL and file uploads to gofile.io; system commands executed via subprocess; potential reverse shell data transmission over socket connection.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system and browser data sources to in-memory variables, then to upload functions that send data over HTTP or socket connections; system commands are executed based on received socket commands, and data is collected from various system and browser storage, then uploaded or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded Discord webhook, server IP, and reverse shell configuration; attempts to decrypt Chrome passwords and cookies; obfuscated or complex code structure; presence of reverse shell and remote command execution; use of cryptography for decryption. The code performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. No clear user consent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates by collecting system info such as OS, IP, MAC, and hostname. It then gathers stored Wi-Fi passwords, Chrome passwords, and cookies by decrypting browser data. Discord tokens are scraped from various application data directories, including browsers and messaging apps. It compiles this data into a Discord embed and sends it via a webhook. The code also includes a reverse shell implementation that connects to a remote server, allowing command execution and tunnel creation. Hardcoded credentials and URLs indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed for stealthy information theft, remote control, and exfiltration, fitting malware and supply chain attack behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious, intended to exfiltrate sensitive user data and enable remote control of the infected system. It employs multiple techniques to harvest data, decrypt stored credentials, and maintain persistence. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and reverse shell capabilities confirms its malicious intent.",
