  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the function just prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code patterns identified. The comment references an external module that could be suspicious, but the code itself does not include any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single function that prints a message. There are no inputs, no external data access, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The comment referencing an external URL could imply intent for malicious code elsewhere, but this specific snippet does not perform any malicious or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there is no malicious behavior or security risk present. It appears to be a placeholder or test function with no harmful intent.",
