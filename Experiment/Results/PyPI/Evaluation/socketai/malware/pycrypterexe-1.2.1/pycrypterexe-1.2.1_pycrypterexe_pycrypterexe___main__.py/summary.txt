  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer and RAT with remote control capabilities. It exfiltrates sensitive data, provides remote command execution, and maintains persistent control points. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.3 due to its complexity, and the overall security risk score to 1 given its severity."
