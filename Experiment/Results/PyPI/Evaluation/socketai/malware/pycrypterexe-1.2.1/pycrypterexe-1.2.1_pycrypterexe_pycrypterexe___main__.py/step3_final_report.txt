{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer and remote access trojan (RAT), collecting system info, WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and establishing a reverse shell for remote command execution. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system commands (netsh, chrome database files, cookies database), network sockets, environment variables, browser storage files, user input via socket commands.",
  "sinks": "Uploads to external web services (Gofile, Discord webhook), socket communication for remote commands, file writes for logs and credential data, network connections for reverse shell.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system/browser sources into logs and files, then to external servers via HTTP POST or socket transmission; commands received over socket are executed and responses sent back; decrypted credentials flow from encrypted storage to exfiltration logs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, server IP, port; complex class structure with nested routines; decryption routines for Chrome passwords and cookies; tunneling commands; minimal obfuscation but complex cryptography routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive data theft (system info, WiFi passwords, Chrome passwords, cookies, Discord tokens), decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptography APIs, exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, and establishes a reverse shell for remote command execution. It contains hardcoded control points and uses Windows-specific cryptography, indicating targeted malicious intent. The structure, while not heavily obfuscated, employs complex routines that suggest an organized malware toolkit. The presence of tunneling commands and socket-based control further confirms malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info-stealer and RAT with remote control capabilities. It exfiltrates sensitive data, provides remote command execution, and maintains persistent control points. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.3 due to its complexity, and the overall security risk score to 1 given its severity.",
