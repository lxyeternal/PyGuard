The package's name and description suggest potential misuse, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in this configuration. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate. Further analysis of the runtime code is recommended to fully assess malicious intent."

It exfiltrates sensitive data, provides remote command execution, and maintains persistent control points. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.3 due to its complexity, and the overall security risk score to 1 given its severity."
