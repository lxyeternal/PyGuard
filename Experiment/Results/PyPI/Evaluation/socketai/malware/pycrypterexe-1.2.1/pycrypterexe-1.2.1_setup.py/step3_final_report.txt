{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package named 'pycrypterexe', specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields and the 'install_requires' list, including 'requests', 'sockets', 'pypiwin32', 'pycryptodome', 'uuid'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in setup.py; dependencies are installed but not executed here.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; setup.py only defines package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The dependency 'sockets' is unusual, as the standard library module is 'socket'. This may be a typo or a third-party package, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a standard package configuration script with no executable code or malicious logic. The description 'Python Crypter File FUD' suggests potential for obfuscation or evasion, but this is only implied by naming, not code. Dependencies listed are common, except 'sockets', which is non-standard. The malware score is low (0.1), reflecting no direct malicious activity; the risk score is moderate (0.2), considering the package's suspicious naming and description. No obfuscation is detected in the code itself. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to the straightforward nature of setup.py and absence of runtime code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign and contains no malicious code. The package's name and description suggest potential misuse, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in this configuration. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate. Further analysis of the runtime code is recommended to fully assess malicious intent.",
