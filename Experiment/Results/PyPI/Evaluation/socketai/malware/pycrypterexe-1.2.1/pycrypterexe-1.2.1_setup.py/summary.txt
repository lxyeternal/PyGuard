  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign and contains no malicious code. The package's name and description suggest potential misuse, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in this configuration. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate. Further analysis of the runtime code is recommended to fully assess malicious intent."
