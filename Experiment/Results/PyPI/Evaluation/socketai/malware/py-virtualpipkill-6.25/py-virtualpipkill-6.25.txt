      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command conditioned on a filesystem check. The obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL indicate potential remote code execution or backdoor behavior. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
