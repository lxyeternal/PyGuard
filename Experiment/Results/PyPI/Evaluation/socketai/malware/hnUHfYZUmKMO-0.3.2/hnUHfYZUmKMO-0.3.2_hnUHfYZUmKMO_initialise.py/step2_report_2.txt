  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages terminal stream wrapping for Windows compatibility via AnsiToWin32, affecting sys.stdout and sys.stderr.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard use of atexit for cleanup. No suspicious data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar stream wrapping for ANSI sequences, with standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is thorough and correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same core functionality, wrapping streams with AnsiToWin32.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no network or data leaks, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The slightly elevated risk score (0.2) is acceptable considering the potential for stream modification, but it's still low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score might be marginally high but is justifiable given stream modifications, though no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages ANSI wrapping, standard stream reassignments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard stream handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar stream wrapping for ANSI sequences.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—mainly the potential for stream modification, which is benign here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of stream reassignments, a slightly higher but still low score (e.g., 0.1) is justified. Since the current scores are within that range, they are acceptable.\n\n### Critical note:\n\n- The core functionality is to manage ANSI escape sequences for terminal output, especially on Windows. This is a common and legitimate utility pattern.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of global variables and stream reassignment is standard for such utilities but should be carefully managed to avoid unintended side effects—however, no such issues are evident here.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0.1**  |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the security implications of the code.",
