{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages console stream wrappers for handling ANSI escape sequences in Windows, providing functionality for colored output and stream reset.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.stdout and sys.stderr, and parameters passed to functions like init() and wrap_stream()",
  "sinks": "Reassigning sys.stdout and sys.stderr, which could potentially affect output behavior or interfere with other processes",
  "flows": "Input from sys.stdout/sys.stderr flows into wrap_stream(), which may wrap streams with AnsiToWin32; wrapped streams may be used for output; reset_all() restores original streams",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity; the code primarily manages stream wrapping, with standard library usage",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for initializing, deinitializing, and reinitializing console streams with ANSI support on Windows. It uses the AnsiToWin32 class to wrap output streams, with proper cleanup registered via atexit. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The logic focuses on stream management and does not include external data fetching, network communication, or file manipulation beyond standard stream handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling console color output on Windows. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on stream management with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
