{
  "purpose": "This code initializes, wraps, and manages ANSI escape sequence handling for stdout and stderr streams, primarily for cross-platform terminal color support.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout and sys.stderr, and takes input parameters such as 'convert', 'strip', 'autoreset', and 'wrap'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams, replacing them with wrapped streams that may process ANSI sequences.",
  "flows": "Initialization function sets sys.stdout and sys.stderr to wrapped streams; context manager temporarily sets them; deinit restores original streams; wrap_stream creates an AnsiToWin32 wrapper if needed.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Uses a third-party module 'ansitowin32', which is standard for handling ANSI sequences on Windows. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. No suspicious dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for handling ANSI sequences on different platforms by wrapping stdout/stderr streams. It uses standard Python practices, including context managers and atexit handlers, to ensure proper setup and teardown. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors was found. The use of 'AnsiToWin32' from a local import indicates a specific handling for Windows terminals, which is typical. No untrusted data flow or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for managing ANSI escape sequence support across platforms. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
