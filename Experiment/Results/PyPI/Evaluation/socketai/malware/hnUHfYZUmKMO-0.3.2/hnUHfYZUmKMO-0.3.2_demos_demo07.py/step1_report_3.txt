  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using colorama in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses colorama to control terminal cursor position and print output.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flows or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard usage of colorama for terminal cursor movement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'fixpath' and 'colorama', initializes colorama, and manipulates cursor position with colorama.Cursor methods to produce a specific terminal output pattern. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious functions are present. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of terminal cursor control using colorama, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor control functionality with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
