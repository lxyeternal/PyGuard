{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library for terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "User input or external data sources are not read; all data is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "Output is printed directly to the terminal; no external data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the terminal, then prints static strings while manipulating cursor position for visual formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functionalities observed. Usage of colorama.Cursor methods for terminal control is standard and intended for formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes colorama, and uses cursor movement functions to manipulate terminal output for demonstration purposes. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used. The code solely prints formatted strings and manipulates cursor positions within the terminal, which is typical for terminal UI demos. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor manipulation using colorama. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
