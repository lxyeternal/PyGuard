  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements for fixpath and colorama; use of colorama.Cursor to generate cursor movement escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output text combined with cursor movement sequences to control terminal cursor position.",
  "flows": "The code constructs terminal escape sequences via colorama.Cursor methods and outputs them with print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions. The use of cursor movement sequences appears to be for demonstration purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, initializes colorama, and prints text combined with terminal cursor movement sequences to manipulate the cursor's position on the terminal screen. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The presence of the 'fixpath' import is unused, which is benign and not suspicious. The code solely manipulates terminal output for demonstration, with no external network activity, data collection, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of cursor movement capabilities using colorama. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain malware. Overall security risk is minimal.",
