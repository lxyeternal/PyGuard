{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console API functions for manipulating console properties such as text attributes, cursor position, and title, primarily for console UI control.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard output/error handles via _GetStdHandle; uses input parameters for console configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Modifies console display attributes, cursor position, and title through Windows API calls, affecting the console environment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., position, attributes, title) flow into API functions that modify console state; handle retrieval functions supply handles used in these modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward API wrapper functions with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Windows console API wrappers that manipulate console appearance and position. It uses standard ctypes calls to interact with system DLLs. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions could be misused if supplied malicious inputs, but as implemented, they are benign. The code is well-structured, with clear API usage, and does not contain any suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Windows console API wrapper intended for console UI control. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects the utility nature of the code with potential for misuse if inputs are malicious.",
