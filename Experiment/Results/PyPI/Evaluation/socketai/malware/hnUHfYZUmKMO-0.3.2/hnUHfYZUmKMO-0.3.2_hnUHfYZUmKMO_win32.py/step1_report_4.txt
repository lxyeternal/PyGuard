  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functions, including getting buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, filling output, and setting the console title.",
  "sources": "Reads environment (console handles), console buffer info, and titles; imports system libraries (ctypes, windll).",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies console display settings and titles; no evidence of data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Uses system handle retrieval to perform console modifications; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Conditional imports handle missing modules gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows API functions for console management, with proper handling of missing modules and error checking. No data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious system modifications are present. The code's structure is standard and intended for legitimate console control, with no obfuscated or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of Windows console functions without malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious activities or system compromises.",
