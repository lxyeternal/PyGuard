{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for interacting with Windows console properties such as screen buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, and console title.",
  "sources": "Reads environment and system data using winapi functions (_GetStdHandle, _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to console output, sets console title, and modifies console display attributes via functions like _SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleTitle, and cursor positioning functions.",
  "flows": "System info is read through _GetStdHandle and _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo; console properties are modified via _SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, and SetConsoleTitle.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable naming or hidden logic. The code strictly interfaces with Windows console API.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Windows console API wrapper, providing functions for console info retrieval and modification. It uses ctypes to load system libraries, and functions are carefully defined with proper argument and return types. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or external calls outside Windows API functions are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for console management, likely used for enhanced terminal output in Windows environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate Windows console interface wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions solely to read and modify console attributes and titles. There is no malicious intent detected.",
