{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates and tests the behavior of ANSI escape sequences (colors) in stdout and stderr, ensuring that redirecting stderr does not affect stdout.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/output via print statements, and indirectly through the colorama library's init function.",
  "sinks": "Print statements to stdout and stderr, which could potentially be redirected or captured.",
  "flows": "Colorama initialization and print to stdout -> print with color codes -> print to stderr -> further stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code, no obfuscated code, and no hidden data leaks or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes colorama for cross-platform ANSI handling, and performs color output to stdout and stderr. The flow is straightforward, involving no user input, external data fetching, or sensitive data handling. The use of colorama is standard for terminal color management. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data theft, or malware. The code is well-structured, and the purpose appears solely for demonstration or testing terminal output behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing ANSI escape sequence handling and redirection behavior. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
