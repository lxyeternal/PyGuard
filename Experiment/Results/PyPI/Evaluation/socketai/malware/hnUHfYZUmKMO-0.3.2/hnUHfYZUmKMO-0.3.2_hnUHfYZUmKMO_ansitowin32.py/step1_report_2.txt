  "purpose": "This module provides classes for handling ANSI escape sequences in terminal output, including converting ANSI codes to Windows API calls, wrapping streams, and managing terminal styles.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), imports from local modules (.ansi, .winterm, .win32), and receives input via the 'write' method of stream wrappers.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to wrapped streams (stdout/stderr), calls Windows API functions via winterm methods, and may modify terminal appearance based on ANSI codes.",
  "flows": "Input text with ANSI sequences is processed by 'write_and_convert', which strips or converts sequences, then outputs to the wrapped stream; ANSI sequences trigger corresponding win32 function calls via 'call_win32'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. The code does not send data over the network or access system files. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. The only system interactions are terminal styling functions, which are typical for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps output streams to handle ANSI escape sequences on Windows systems, converting them into WinAPI calls if supported, or stripping them otherwise. It uses regular expressions to parse ANSI sequences and calls corresponding functions to change terminal styles or cursor positions. No external data inputs, network communication, or file manipulations are present. The code performs standard terminal styling operations and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or covert communication channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for handling ANSI escape sequences in terminal output, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for terminal styling purposes and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
