  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' source directory for import resolution, facilitating local development or testing.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current script directory, then computes its parent directory.",
  "sinks": "Inserts the parent directory into sys.path at position 0, affecting module import resolution.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> compute parent directory -> insert into sys.path -> subsequent module imports (e.g., 'import colorama')",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for development environments.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly determines the parent directory of the current script and prepends it to sys.path, ensuring local modules are imported over installed ones. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The manipulation of sys.path is a common pattern in development setups. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors are involved. The code's intent is benign, aimed at facilitating local testing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate, with the slight risk score reflecting minimal potential misuse if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard development pattern for local module resolution. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code and poses minimal security risk. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
