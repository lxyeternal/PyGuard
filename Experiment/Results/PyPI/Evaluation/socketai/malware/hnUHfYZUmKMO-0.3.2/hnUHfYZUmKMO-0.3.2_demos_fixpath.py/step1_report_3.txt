  "purpose": "Adjust the Python import path to prioritize a local 'colorama' module over an installed version.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (__file__), reading environment variables (implicitly via __file__), accessing and modifying sys.path",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path to influence module import behavior",
  "flows": "Code reads the current script's location (__file__), computes the parent directory, and inserts it into sys.path to affect module imports",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code performs a standard path modification for local module resolution, with no hidden or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code modifies sys.path by adding the parent directory of the current script to the beginning of the module search path. This is a common technique used during development to ensure local modules are imported over installed packages. No external input, no network access, no code obfuscation, and no malicious logic are present. The operation is straightforward and typical for local development setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to prioritize local module import; it does not contain malicious behavior. It is a standard development practice and presents no security concerns.",
