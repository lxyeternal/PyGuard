{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, such as colors, styles, and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code defines constants, class attributes, and functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Functions return escape sequences based on input parameters; no sinks involve untrusted data being directly executed or transmitted. No evident data leaks or unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like mode, n, x, y, or title) are used to generate ANSI escape sequences; flows are straightforward, from function parameters to returned escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely straightforward and well-structured. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for escape characters and functions/classes to produce ANSI terminal control sequences. The AnsiCodes class dynamically wraps class attribute values with escape sequences upon instantiation. Cursor movement functions produce standard escape sequences. No external input handling or unsafe operations are present. The code appears intended for terminal text formatting and does not perform network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for terminal ANSI escape codes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured implementation of terminal formatting functions.",
