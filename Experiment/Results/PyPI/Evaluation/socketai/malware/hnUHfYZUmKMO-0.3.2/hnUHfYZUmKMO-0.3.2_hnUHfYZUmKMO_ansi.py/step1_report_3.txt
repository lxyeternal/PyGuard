{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are read; the code defines constants and functions for generating escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "The functions return strings with escape sequences, which are used directly in terminal output; no data leaks or external effects are observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow is present; the functions generate static escape sequences or incorporate simple parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. The class attributes are well-defined ANSI codes, and methods straightforwardly generate escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. The functions are simple and static, with no user input processing or external data handling. The class methods create escape codes based on provided parameters, but these are standard and controlled. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for formatting terminal output and does not perform any data manipulation or network activity.",
