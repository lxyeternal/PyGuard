{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text styling, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "The code defines static variables for ANSI codes and functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Functions that return escape sequences based on input parameters (e.g., set_title, clear_screen, clear_line, code_to_chars, cursor movements).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to strings and concatenated with escape sequence constants to produce output sequences for terminal control.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns; the code relies on static data and straightforward string concatenation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and functions for terminal control via ANSI escape codes. Class constructors convert class attribute values into escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard for such modules. No external data input handling, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors are detected. The functions generate escape sequences based on given parameters, which is typical for terminal styling libraries. The design is simple, static, and safe, focusing on terminal control sequences without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility that generates ANSI escape codes for text formatting, cursor movement, and screen management. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security threat.",
