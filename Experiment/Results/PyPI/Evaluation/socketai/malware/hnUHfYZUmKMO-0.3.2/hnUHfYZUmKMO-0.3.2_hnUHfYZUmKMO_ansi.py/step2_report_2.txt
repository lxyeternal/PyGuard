  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen clearing.\n- No external data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and safe.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Validity:\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: static constants, functions returning escape sequences, classes wrapping static values into escape sequences.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The design is simple and appropriate for its purpose.\n- The instantiation of classes to wrap static values with escape sequences is standard practice.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 in some reports, which is very low, reflecting minimal security risk due to potential misuse (e.g., in malicious scripts, escape sequences could be used for terminal-based attacks). However, given the code's benign nature, a score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for maximum accuracy.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or exploits that aren't supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0** |\n\nThe only point of discussion is the small security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports. While the code itself is safe, in a security context, escape sequences could be exploited if misused. But given the benign static nature, I agree with setting the risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is a benign, well-structured utility for generating ANSI escape sequences.**\n- **No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.**\n- **Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.**\n\nPlease proceed with these final scores and reasoning.",
