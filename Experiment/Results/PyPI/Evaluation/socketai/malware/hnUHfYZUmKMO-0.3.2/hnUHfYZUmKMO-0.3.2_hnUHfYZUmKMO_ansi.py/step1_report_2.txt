{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "The code defines static ANSI escape sequences and character codes; it does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output effects are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the functions generate static ANSI codes without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code mainly defines constants and simple functions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and provides utility functions for cursor movement, screen clearing, and setting terminal titles. The classes initialize instance attributes with formatted ANSI codes, but all data is static and hardcoded. There are no input reads, external data processing, or potentially malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and serves as a utility module for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for terminal ANSI codes with no malicious intent. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
