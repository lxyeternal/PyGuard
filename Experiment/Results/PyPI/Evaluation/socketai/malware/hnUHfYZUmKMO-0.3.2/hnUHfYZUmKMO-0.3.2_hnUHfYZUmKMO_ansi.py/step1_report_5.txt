{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "The code defines static constants for ANSI codes and functions that generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Functions that return escape sequences directly using string concatenation, which can be used to control terminal output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that generate escape sequences, which can influence terminal display but do not execute or modify external data or systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly generates ANSI sequences; no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are detected. It does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining constants and functions to produce ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output. It includes classes for text foreground and background colors, styles, and cursor control, initialized to produce the proper escape sequences. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or behavior that could be exploited for malware. It appears to be a utility library intended solely for terminal styling, with no external data inputs or outputs beyond generating control sequences.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for generating terminal styling escape sequences. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks, and it is safe to use.",
