  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided details, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward ANSI escape code generator for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen clearing.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is mentioned.\n- The code relies solely on static constants and simple string concatenation.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk near zero, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code appears correct and standard for ANSI escape code utilities.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The functions and classes are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n- Obfuscated: 0, matching the straightforward nature.\n- Security risk: very low (0.1 or 0), consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports' conclusions are aligned with the code's nature.\n- The only potential concern could be if the code were to be misused (e.g., injecting escape sequences maliciously). However, given the static nature and lack of external input, this is unlikely.\n- The class `AnsiCodes` dynamically wraps class attribute values into escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard for such utilities.\n- Cursor movement functions generate standard sequences, and no dangerous behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- **Potential adjustments:** No changes needed; the assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — very minimal, primarily because misuse of escape sequences could cause display issues, but not security threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility for terminal styling, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per report or further analysis.",
