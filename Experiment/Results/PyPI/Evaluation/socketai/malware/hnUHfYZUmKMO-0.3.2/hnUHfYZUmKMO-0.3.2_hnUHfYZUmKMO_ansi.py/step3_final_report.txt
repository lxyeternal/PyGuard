{
  "purpose": "This code provides constants, functions, and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Functions like code_to_chars, set_title, clear_screen, clear_line, and class attributes in AnsiCodes and subclasses that define static color/style codes.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations producing escape sequences; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) are combined with static escape sequence templates to produce control sequences.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is static, straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility for terminal styling, defining constants and functions that generate escape sequences. Classes initialize instance attributes with these sequences based on class attributes, which are static. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The functions and classes are safe and standard for terminal control. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to potential misuse but not actual malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
