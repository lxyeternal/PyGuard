  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malware or malicious activity detected. The obfuscation is only in the package name, not in code logic. The security risk is negligible. The high obfuscation score in some reports is overstated; a score around 0.2–0.3 is more appropriate. The malware score remains 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe supply chain with minor obfuscation concerns."
