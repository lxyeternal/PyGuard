  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a package with metadata and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads __init__.py for version, README.rst for description, and package files for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leaks; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads files, extracts version via regex, passes metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'hnUHfYZUmKMO'; outdated 'from __future__ import with_statement'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious logic. The package name appears obfuscated but is not malicious. The outdated future import is harmless but indicates legacy code. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection present. The regex for version extraction is safe. The obfuscated name warrants a moderate suspicion score but does not imply malicious intent. The overall code is benign, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malware or malicious activity detected. The obfuscation is only in the package name, not in code logic. The security risk is negligible. The high obfuscation score in some reports is overstated; a score around 0.2–0.3 is more appropriate. The malware score remains 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe supply chain with minor obfuscation concerns.",
