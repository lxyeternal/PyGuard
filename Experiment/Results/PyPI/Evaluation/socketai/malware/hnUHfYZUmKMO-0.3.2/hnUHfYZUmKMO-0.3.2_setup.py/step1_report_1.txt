  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package, reading package metadata, and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading files (__file__, 'hnUHfYZUmKMO/__init__.py', 'README.rst') for package info and version extraction.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no sensitive data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Read package files -> extract version info -> pass metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure package name 'hnUHfYZUmKMO' and a randomly named variable; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading files, extracting version info with regex, and configuring package setup parameters. It handles the version retrieval safely, without executing untrusted code or including malicious logic. The code imports setup functions and uses file operations securely. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious instructions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It uses standard practices for package setup and versioning without any suspicious activity.",
