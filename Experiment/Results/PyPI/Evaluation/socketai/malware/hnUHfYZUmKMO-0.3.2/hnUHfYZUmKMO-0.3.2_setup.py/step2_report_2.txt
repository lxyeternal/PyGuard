  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reading files for package info and version.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** No external data sinks, no malicious behavior. The package name is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Standard practices, safe regex for version extraction, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the findings.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, reading version and README.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Unusual package name, outdated future import, but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No code execution, no data leaks, just an obfuscated package name.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.2 (some suspicion due to name), Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, reading version and description.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Obfuscated package name, no malicious code, outdated future import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just an obfuscated package name.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.2, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Obfuscated package name, outdated future import, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7 (high suspicion), Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Typical setup, no external data flow.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Obfuscated package name, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.2, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior. The code is static, reads files, and calls setup(). No network, code injection, or malicious logic detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The only recurring suspicious element is the package name 'hnUHfYZUmKMO', which appears obfuscated or randomly generated. While this is unusual, it doesn't necessarily indicate malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Metric          | Suggested Score | Justification                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                                    |\n| Obfuscated    | **0.2**           | Package name appears obfuscated but no malicious activity linked to it.                   |\n| Security Risk   | **0.1**           | Slight concern due to obfuscated name, but no actual risk or vulnerability present.       |\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable, but I would lower the obfuscated score slightly from 0.7 to 0.2, reflecting that obfuscation alone isn't malicious, and maintain the malware at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscated package name is suspicious but not malicious. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese scores reflect the analysis and are consistent with the evidence provided.",
