{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to facilitate the setup and packaging of a Python project named 'hnUHfYZUmKMO', including reading version information and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads __init__.py for version info, README.rst for long description, and filesystem for package files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily reads files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from __init__.py → used in setup() for package versioning; reads README.rst → used for long description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'hnUHfYZUmKMO' appears to be a non-meaningful, obfuscated string; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, includes a fallback for setuptools, defines functions to read file contents and extract version info via regex. The setup() call uses these functions to specify package metadata. The regex searches for __version__ in the __init__.py file, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical setup scripts, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. The unusual package name appears to be an obfuscated string, but this alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code is safe, with no security risks identified.",
