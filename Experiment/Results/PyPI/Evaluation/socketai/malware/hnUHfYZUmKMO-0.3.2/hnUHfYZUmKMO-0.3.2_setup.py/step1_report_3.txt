{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'hnUHfYZUmKMO', including reading metadata and version info for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' string from the '__init__.py' file and reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package files and uses it in setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: importing modules, defining helper functions to read files and extract version info via regex, and calling setup() with package metadata. The regex for version extraction is straightforward and safe. The code does not execute any external or untrusted code, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious constructs. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated package name, which might indicate an attempt to obscure intent but is not malicious by itself. No signs of malware, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. The obfuscated package name is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the script appears safe, serving only to package a Python project.",
