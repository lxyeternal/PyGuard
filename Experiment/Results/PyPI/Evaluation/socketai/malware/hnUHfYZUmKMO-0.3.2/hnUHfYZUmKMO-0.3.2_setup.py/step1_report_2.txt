{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file to extract version info, and reads README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and version info, no untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears as a random string 'hnUHfYZUmKMO', which is unusual but not malicious. The code contains an outdated future import, likely for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with minimal logic. It imports necessary modules, defines functions to read files and extract version info, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no suspicious behavior. The use of a random-looking package name is suspicious but does not constitute malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The script appears safe and typical for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual package name is noteworthy but not malicious. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
