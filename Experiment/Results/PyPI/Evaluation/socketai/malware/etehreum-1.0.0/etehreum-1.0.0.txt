      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation on Windows. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are red flags. The high scores in the reports are justified; I recommend setting the malware score to 1.0 to reflect certainty of malicious intent, with high obfuscation and risk scores also appropriate."
