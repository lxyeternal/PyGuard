  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and os modules; decrypts and executes Fernet-encrypted code during installation if on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code that could potentially run malicious payload during installation on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes an embedded payload.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class name and variable names; encrypted payload executed during install; no clear legitimate purpose for decryption and execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports modules and decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload, then executes it via exec(). The encrypted string appears to contain malicious code or payload, which is decrypted at runtime. The rest of the setup uses standard packaging procedures but the embedded encrypted execution is suspicious, especially since no legitimate purpose for decrypting and executing code during install is evident. The code's obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, as it decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems without clear justification. The obfuscation and encrypted payload raise significant security concerns. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
