  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup with custom installation behavior, potentially involving decryption and execution of remote or encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import requests, import Fernet, exec with decrypted code, reading setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "exec with decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code during install.",
  "flows": "During install, code checks OS, then executes decrypted code which may perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with decrypted content; encrypted data embedded in code; complex class and function names suggest obfuscation; setting up request and Fernet imports only if on Windows; potentially executing remote or encrypted payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with an obfuscated class name and encrypted payload. During installation on Windows, it decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string using Fernet and executes the result with exec. This pattern is often indicative of malicious behavior such as executing remote payloads, backdoors, or malicious scripts hidden within the encrypted string. The code checks for Windows OS before executing, possibly to target specific environments. The use of exec with decrypted code is a significant security concern. The package metadata itself appears benign, but the runtime behavior during install is suspicious, involving decryption and execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes a payload during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The encrypted payload combined with exec indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity, such as executing arbitrary code on the target system, possibly for backdoor or malware purposes.",
