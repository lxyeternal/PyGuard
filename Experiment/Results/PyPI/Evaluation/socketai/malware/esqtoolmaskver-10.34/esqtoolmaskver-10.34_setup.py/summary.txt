  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup, with a suspicious URL comment. The embedded payload is likely malicious, warranting caution. The current security scores are appropriate, but decoding the payload would provide definitive confirmation."
