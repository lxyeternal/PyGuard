      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup, with a suspicious URL comment. The embedded payload is likely malicious, warranting caution. The current security scores are appropriate, but decoding the payload would provide definitive confirmation."
