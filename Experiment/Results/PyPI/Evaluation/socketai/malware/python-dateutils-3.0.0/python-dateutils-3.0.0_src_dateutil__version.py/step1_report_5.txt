  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, likely auto-generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = version = '3.0.0') and the version tuple (__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (3, 0, 0)).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions beyond variable assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected; the code comments indicate it is auto-generated and should not be modified.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting version information variables, likely automatically generated during build or packaging. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or code execution that could be malicious. It adheres to standard practices for version management and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely defining package version information. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
