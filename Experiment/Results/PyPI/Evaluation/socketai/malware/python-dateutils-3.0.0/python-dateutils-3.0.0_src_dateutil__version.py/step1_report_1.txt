  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples from setuptools_scm output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output detected.",
  "flows": "Assignment statements set version variables from static strings/tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code explicitly states version info, minimal logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static version information to variables, indicating the package version. It is generated by setuptools_scm, a standard version management tool. There are no inputs, external data reads, or suspicious operations. No malware or malicious behavior is present. The code is simple and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is benign and typical in Python package metadata.",
