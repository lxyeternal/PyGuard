  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**  \nThe code is a simple Python script that assigns static version strings and tuples to variables:\n```python\n__version__ = version = '3.0.0'\n__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (3, 0, 0)\n```\nThis is a standard pattern for package version metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data processing.\n- It is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a well-known version management tool.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**  \nAll five reports consistently describe the code as benign, auto-generated, and straightforward. They correctly identify that the code only assigns static version info, with no data flows or external interactions.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign `0`. No security risks are evident.\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation**  \n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The code is standard for package versioning and does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**  \nBased on the code and reports, I agree with their conclusions. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
