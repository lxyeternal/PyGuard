{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuples, metadata comments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data to variables; no flow of untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicating auto-generation; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting version information using hardcoded strings and tuples. Comments specify it's auto-generated by setuptools_scm and advise against manual modification. No external inputs, no data processing, no suspicious code structures or behaviors observed. The code is typical for package versioning metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version metadata file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply declares version info, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
