  "purpose": "Declare package version information using static variables, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version string and tuple to variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, inputs, or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static assignments, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed version information to variables, generated by a standard tool. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
