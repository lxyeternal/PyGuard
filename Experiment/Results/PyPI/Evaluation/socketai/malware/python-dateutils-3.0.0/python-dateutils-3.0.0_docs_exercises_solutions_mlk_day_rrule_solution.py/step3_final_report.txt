{
  "purpose": "Calculates the date of MLK Day (third Monday of January) starting from 1986 using dateutil.rrule and tests its correctness over specified date ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads from dateutil.rrule and datetime modules; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely computational with internal tests.",
  "flows": "Defines recurrence rule as source; test cases verify output within date ranges; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard recurrence rule to model MLK Day, with tests confirming correctness. It uses trusted libraries and contains no external inputs or network operations. The logic is straightforward, and the test cases are appropriate. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of MLK Day calculation with proper testing. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
