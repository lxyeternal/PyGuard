{
  "purpose": "Define and test the date of Martin Luther King Jr. Day for multiple years using recurrence rules.",
  "sources": "Imports from dateutil and datetime modules, constant definitions, and test cases that supply date ranges.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily performs date calculations and comparisons without any untrusted data input or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code computes fixed date rules and tests them internally without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The recurrence rule is straightforward; no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day using dateutil.rrule, which calculates the third Monday of January annually since 1986. It then runs tests comparing the calculated dates within specified date ranges. The code appears to be a standard, benign date calculation with no dynamic input handling or external data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date calculation module that defines MLK Day and verifies its correctness against test cases. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies present. It is safe and straightforward.",
