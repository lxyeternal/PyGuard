  "purpose": "Define and test the calculation of MLK Day dates using the dateutil.rrule library.",
  "sources": "Input data from the MLK_TEST_CASES list; data read from datetime objects for date range filtering.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs date calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input datetime ranges flow into the rrule.between() function, which outputs lists of datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day using dateutil.rrule, then tests this rule against predefined date ranges. The logic is standard and does not involve any dynamic code execution, network access, or handling of untrusted input. The test cases simply verify correct date calculations. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard date calculation for MLK Day with associated tests. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
