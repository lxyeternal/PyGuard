  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) for various years and test this calculation over specific date ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads input date ranges from the MLK_TEST_CASES list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed, no external data or outputs pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Input date ranges flow into the test_mlk_day function, which verifies the output of the rrule.between method against expected dates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an rrule to compute MLK Day dates, then tests these calculations over predefined date ranges. The logic is standard, using the dateutil library for recurrence rules, with no suspicious operations. No external inputs or data leaks are involved, and there are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate date calculation and testing script for MLK Day, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
