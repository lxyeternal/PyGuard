  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (MLK Day) for each year starting from 1986 using the dateutil.rrule library, and test these calculations with predefined date ranges.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from dateutil import rrule' and 'from datetime import datetime'; data definitions: 'MLK_DAY' rule setup, 'MLK_TEST_CASES' list",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; the code only defines static rules and data, and performs internal assertions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from external sources to sinks; the code operates on predefined constants and performs in-memory assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a recurrence rule for MLK Day based on a specific pattern (third Monday of January starting from 1986). It then defines test cases that verify the rule's correctness within given date ranges through assertions. No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved. The code relies on standard libraries and contains straightforward logic. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code appears to be a typical date calculation and validation script.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign calculation of MLK Day dates, with proper testing to verify correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security issues. The code is safe and trustworthy.",
