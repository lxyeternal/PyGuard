  "purpose": "Calculate the dates of Martin Luther King Jr. Day (third Monday of January) for specific years using the dateutil rrule library.",
  "sources": "Imports from dateutil and datetime modules; constants defining the rule; test cases providing date ranges.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input; no data output effects; no network or file operations; no sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The rrule object defines a recurrence rule; the test function verifies the rule's output against expected dates within specified ranges.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of dateutil's rrule for recurring date calculations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard date handling libraries, defines a recurrence rule for MLK Day as the third Monday of January each year starting from 1986, and tests this rule against multiple date ranges. The rule correctly calculates MLK Day dates. No user input, network operations, or suspicious code behavior is present. The code appears to be a benign date calculation utility. The test cases validate the correctness of the rule across different periods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate date calculation script for MLK Day with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on trusted standard libraries and implements a simple, well-defined recurrence rule.",
