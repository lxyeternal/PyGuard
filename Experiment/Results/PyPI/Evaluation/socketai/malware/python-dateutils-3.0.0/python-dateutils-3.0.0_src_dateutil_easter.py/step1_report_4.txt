  "purpose": "Calculate Easter date using different calendar algorithms based on the specified method.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' and 'method'; imported modules (datetime).",
  "sinks": "Returns a datetime.date object representing Easter Sunday for the given year and method.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' -> Calculation of Easter date based on algorithm -> Return date object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code, no network activity, or unusual side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known algorithms for calculating Easter dates. It takes a year and method as input, performs date calculations based on established mathematical formulas, and returns a date object. No data is read from external sources during execution. The code uses standard Python modules and straightforward logic without any hidden or malicious operations. No user input, network calls, or file manipulations are present that could be exploited maliciously. The code appears to be a legitimate utility function with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a legitimate calculation of Easter dates using standard algorithms. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use in production.",
