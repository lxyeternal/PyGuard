  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input: year parameter; constants EASTER_JULIAN, EASTER_ORTHODOX, EASTER_WESTERN; no other external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return of a datetime.date object representing Easter date; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Input year → calculation based on method → return date object; no external or untrusted data flows or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors, no data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-documented algorithm for calculating Easter based on different calendar methods. It uses standard Python constructs, imports only the datetime module, and performs mathematical calculations based on input parameters. No external data sources are accessed, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or privilege escalation. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of established algorithms with clear, commented logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Easter date calculation algorithms without any signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It reads only the input parameter, performs standard calculations, and returns a date object. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
