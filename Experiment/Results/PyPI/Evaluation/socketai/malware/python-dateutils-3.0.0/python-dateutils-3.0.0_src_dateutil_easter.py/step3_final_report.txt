  "purpose": "Calculate Easter dates for a given year using Julian, Orthodox, or Western algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'year' and 'method'; internal calculations based on established algorithms.",
  "sinks": "None; deterministic calculations without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' → internal algorithm computations → return datetime.date object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of known algorithms; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Easter calculation algorithms based on well-documented formulas. It uses only the 'datetime' module, performs deterministic calculations, and returns a date object. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The logic aligns with established algorithms, and the code is clear and well-documented. Scores from reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or very close) are consistent with this assessment. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of known algorithms for calculating Easter dates. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for use. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.",
