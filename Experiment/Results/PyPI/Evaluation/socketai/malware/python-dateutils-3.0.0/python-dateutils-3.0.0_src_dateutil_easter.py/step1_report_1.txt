{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different calendar methods (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Reads the input parameter 'year' and 'method'. Uses the datetime module for date creation.",
  "sinks": "Uses datetime.date to generate a date object; no untrusted data is written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' determine calculations; the date generated is based solely on deterministic astronomical algorithms. No external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The logic is standard for astronomical calculations of Easter date.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only the datetime module, defines constants for different methods, and implements the Easter date calculation algorithms based on well-documented methods. No untrusted data sources, nor does it perform actions that could leak data, connect to servers, or execute malicious commands. The calculations are deterministic and based on publicly known algorithms. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Easter date calculation algorithms without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective, serving a legitimate purpose with no indications of malicious activity.",
