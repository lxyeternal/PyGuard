{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' and optional 'method' argument; data retrieved from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or network operations, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' flow through calculations to determine the date; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs straightforward date calculations based on well-known algorithms; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements established algorithms for calculating Easter dates, with clear logic separating different methods. It uses only safe mathematical operations and Python's datetime module. There are no external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated elements. The functions and variables are descriptive. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is a standard implementation of calendar algorithms with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of Easter date calculation algorithms. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The logic is straightforward and based on well-documented formulas.",
