  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using various calendar algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input: year parameter, method parameter; Uses built-in datetime module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is being processed or output in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' are used internally to compute date; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward date calculations based on well-known algorithms without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for different Easter calculation methods and provides a function to compute Easter's date based on selected algorithm. It uses standard arithmetic and modular operations to determine the date, relying on the datetime module for output. No external data sources, network operations, or unsafe behaviors are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious intent. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of historical Easter calculation algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Easter date calculations with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks identified. It safely computes and returns a date object based on the provided year and method. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
