{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class 'relativedelta' for manipulating date and time differences, including relative and absolute date adjustments, primarily for use with datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as datetime, calendar, operator, math, six, and a local module '._common'. No explicit input or data sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data directly; the code primarily performs date calculations and transformations.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve constructing relativedelta objects from date/datetime inputs or keyword arguments, performing arithmetic operations with datetime objects, and adjusting date components. No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code includes standard date manipulation logic, and no obfuscated language features or malicious behaviors are present. The only potential concern is the warning about non-integer absolute values, which is standard deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a date utility class for date calculations and modifications. It handles input validation, date arithmetic, and date normalization. The constructor computes date differences when given two dates, and the class provides methods for addition, subtraction, negation, and comparison of date intervals. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or covert channels. All imports and operations are standard for date/time handling. The only notable behavior is the deprecation warning for non-integer absolute date components, which is benign and related to future-proofing. Overall, the code is a typical date/time manipulation library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a relativedelta class for date calculations, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs date arithmetic and adjustments using common Python modules and patterns. There are no suspicious data flows or embedded malware. The security risk level is very low.",
