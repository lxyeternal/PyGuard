{
  "purpose": "This code defines a 'relativedelta' class for manipulating date and time differences, supporting various relative and absolute time adjustments, and providing arithmetic operations with datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments during instantiation, particularly from datetime objects, date/datetime attributes, and user-provided parameters such as years, months, days, etc.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs modified datetime or date objects through arithmetic operations (__add__, __sub__, etc.). No external data sinks or network connections are present; no data leakage mechanisms are identified.",
  "flows": "Input sources (datetime objects and parameters) flow into the 'relativedelta' constructor, which processes and stores relative/absolute time adjustments. These adjustments flow through arithmetic methods (__add__, __sub__) into resulting datetime/date objects. No external data flow or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities, is present. The code performs standard date/time arithmetic with clear, documented logic. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for relative date/time adjustments, supporting complex operations like adding, subtracting, and normalizing time intervals. It uses standard libraries (datetime, calendar) and careful type checks. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are found. The code does include some warnings about deprecated float usage for absolute time components, but this is standard and not malicious. The implementation relies on conventional arithmetic and data handling. Overall, the code appears to be a typical date utility with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a date/time manipulation utility class, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. It performs standard operations and data handling. The overall security risk is negligible.",
