  "purpose": "A date manipulation utility class ('relativedelta') designed to perform relative and absolute adjustments to datetime objects, supporting complex date arithmetic and normalization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for date/datetime objects, including dt1 and dt2 for date differences, and various keyword arguments for absolute/relative date components.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform external data output, network communication, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input date/datetime objects and parameters flow through internal calculations, adjustments, and normalization to produce modified datetime objects; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard deprecation warnings about non-integer absolute parameters are present but benign; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard 'relativedelta' class for date arithmetic, handling relative and absolute components, normalization, and comparison. It relies solely on standard modules and internal logic, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The deprecation warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The logic is consistent, well-structured, and aligns with typical date utility implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign, well-implemented date manipulation utility with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
