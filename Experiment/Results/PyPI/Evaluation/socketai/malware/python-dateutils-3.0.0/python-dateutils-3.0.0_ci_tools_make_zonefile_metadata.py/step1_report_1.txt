  "purpose": "Generate a JSON metadata file containing SHA-512 hash of a specified tzdata tarball and associated metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the specified tzdata file from disk",
  "sinks": "Writing the generated metadata JSON to a file",
  "flows": "Input file (tzdata) is read to compute SHA-512 hash, then the metadata is formatted and written to an output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The script performs straightforward file hashing and JSON formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a user-specified tzdata file, computes its SHA-512 hash securely, formats a metadata template with provided version info and hash, and writes the result to a file. It uses standard libraries and methods with no external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of generating metadata for tzdata files. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for generating metadata, primarily hashing a specified file and saving formatted output. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
