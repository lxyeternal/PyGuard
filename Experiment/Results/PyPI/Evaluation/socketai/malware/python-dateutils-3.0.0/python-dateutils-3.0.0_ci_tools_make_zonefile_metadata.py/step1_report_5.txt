  "purpose": "This script calculates the SHA-512 hash of a given tzdata tarball file and generates a JSON metadata file containing version info and the hash.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line arguments, reads the specified tzdata file from disk.",
  "sinks": "Writes a JSON-formatted metadata string to an output file specified by command-line argument.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> calculate_sha512() -> hash value -> format metadata template -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard file reading and hashing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script straightforwardly computes the SHA-512 hash of a user-provided file and writes structured metadata to an output file. It uses standard libraries (hashlib, argparse) with no suspicious logic. No external network activity, no code obfuscation, and no malicious code behaviors are present. The operations are typical for checksum generation and metadata creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility script for generating metadata about a tzdata file, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
