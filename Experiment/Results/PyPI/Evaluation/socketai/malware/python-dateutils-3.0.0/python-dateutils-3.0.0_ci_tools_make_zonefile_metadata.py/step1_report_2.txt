  "purpose": "This script calculates the SHA-512 hash of a specified tzdata tarball file and generates a JSON metadata file containing version info and the hash.",
  "sources": "The input tzdata filename and version provided via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The output file where the JSON metadata is written.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> calculate_sha512 (reads the specified file) -> format metadata JSON -> write to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward file hashing and JSON formatting without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a user-specified file, computes its SHA-512 hash, and writes formatted metadata to a file. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or obfuscated components. Usage of hashlib for hashing is standard. The code does not process untrusted data beyond the specified input file. It simply performs a hashing operation and writes data to a file. No security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for generating metadata about a tzdata tarball, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
