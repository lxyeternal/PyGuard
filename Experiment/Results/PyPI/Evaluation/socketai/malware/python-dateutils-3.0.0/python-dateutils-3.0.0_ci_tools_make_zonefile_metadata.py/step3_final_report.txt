  "purpose": "Generate JSON metadata for tzdata tarball, including SHA-512 hash and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads the specified tzdata file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated JSON metadata to an output file.",
  "flows": "Reads the tzdata file -> computes SHA-512 hash -> formats metadata string -> writes to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a user-specified file, computes its SHA-512 hash, and writes a JSON-formatted metadata file. It performs no network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. The minimal security concern is reading arbitrary files, which is expected for such a utility. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for generating metadata for tzdata tarballs. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor security concern about reading arbitrary files is inherent to its purpose and does not indicate malicious intent.",
