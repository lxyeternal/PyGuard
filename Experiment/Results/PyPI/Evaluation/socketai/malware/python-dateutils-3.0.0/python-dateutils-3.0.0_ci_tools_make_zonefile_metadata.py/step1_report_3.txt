  "purpose": "Generate a JSON metadata file containing information and a SHA-512 checksum for a specified tzdata tarball file.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments ('tzdata' filename and 'version'), reading the tzdata file to compute its SHA-512 checksum.",
  "sinks": "Writing the generated metadata JSON to a specified output file.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> calculate_sha512 reading tzdata file -> format metadata string -> write to output file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code straightforwardly computes a checksum and writes metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script reads user-supplied filenames and version info via command-line arguments. It computes the SHA-512 hash of the specified file, then creates a JSON-like metadata string that includes this hash, and finally writes the metadata to a file. All operations are standard, with no external network connections, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The only potential concern is the reading of arbitrary files specified by the user, but this is expected behavior given the script's purpose and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for generating metadata with checksum verification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The usage is straightforward and intended for legitimate checksum and metadata generation.",
