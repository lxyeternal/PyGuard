  "purpose": "This script updates timezone data files by downloading them from specified mirror URLs and verifying their integrity before rebuilding zoneinfo.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'metadata' JSON file, including URLs and file hashes; reads the timezone data file from disk.",
  "sinks": "Reads the timezone data file for hashing; downloads files from URLs; raises errors if download fails.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata from JSON -> Downloads tzdata file from mirror URLs -> Reads the downloaded file -> Hashes and verifies -> Calls rebuild to update timezone info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic URL joins and mirror URL fallback; printing of download progress; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; SHA verification is straightforward. No suspicious or obfuscated code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The script loads metadata from a JSON file, then attempts to download timezone data from provided mirror URLs if the local file is missing. It handles URL errors gracefully, trying next mirrors. Once downloaded, it computes a SHA-512 hash of the file and compares it to a provided hash for integrity verification. If verification passes, it rebuilds timezone data using the 'dateutil.zoneinfo' rebuild function. The code uses standard libraries and well-understood security practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to perform legitimate update operations for timezone data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate timezone data updater with proper integrity checks. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or suspicious anomalies. No malicious behavior detected. Overall security risk is low.",
