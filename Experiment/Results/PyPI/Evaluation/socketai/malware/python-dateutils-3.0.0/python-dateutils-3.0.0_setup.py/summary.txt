  "security_risk": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.95,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to conceal its true payloads through multiple layers of obfuscation. It employs dynamic code execution techniques common in malware, with embedded URLs indicating potential remote command and control activity. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is near certainty."
