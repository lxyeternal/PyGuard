  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code files, modules, or snippets provided within the reports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network connections, data leaks, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through code logic to sinks (outputs or actions), which could be malicious if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual patterns include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. No such anomalies are detected in the provided reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports primarily indicate absence or minimal presence of code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. Confidence levels are high where code is minimal or absent. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately low or zero, reflecting the benign nature of the content. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and descriptions across all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall security posture appears benign. No further action or escalation is necessary based on current data.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
