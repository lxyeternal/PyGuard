  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, silent execution of a payload triggered conditionally. The pattern aligns with common malware delivery techniques. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
