{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction with various suffixes, intended for basic calculations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (n1, n1) which are incorrectly declared, and references to undefined variables like 'n2' within functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted data inputs; functions perform internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (though incorrectly declared) flow into arithmetic operations; however, due to syntax errors, actual execution flow is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated parameter names ('n1' used twice), references to undefined variables ('n2'), syntax errors prevent code execution, no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions for addition and subtraction with suffix variants, but all have syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and undefined variables. These issues prevent execution but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity are present. The cryptic comment and URL appear to be signatures or signatures, not malicious indicators. The code is straightforward but poorly written, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The syntax errors are the primary flaw, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but syntactically flawed. There is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.1) due to poor coding practices but no security threat.",
