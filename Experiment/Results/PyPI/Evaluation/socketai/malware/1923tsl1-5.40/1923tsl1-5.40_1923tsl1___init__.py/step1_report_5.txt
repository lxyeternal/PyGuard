{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement basic arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with various function names, possibly for a calculator or similar utility.",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n1 (which should be n1 and n2, but are misnamed). No external data inputs are evident, no user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No data output sinks that could lead to data leakage or security issues. No network calls, file writes, or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The functions perform simple computations with their parameters but are not invoked or chained, so no data flow or malicious payload transfer is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple code issues: function parameter naming is inconsistent and incorrect (using n1 twice, should be n1 and n2). All functions perform straightforward arithmetic without any obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple arithmetic functions with redundant and inconsistent naming. The primary concern is the incorrect parameter naming (using n1 twice), which indicates possible errors or poorly written code. There are no signs of malicious intent, external data access, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any dangerous operations. The initial comment referencing 'Tag && EsqueleSquad' is unrelated to code behavior and appears to be a signature or attribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or malicious behavior. It is simple, although poorly written, arithmetic functions with no security risks. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or supply chain attacks.",
