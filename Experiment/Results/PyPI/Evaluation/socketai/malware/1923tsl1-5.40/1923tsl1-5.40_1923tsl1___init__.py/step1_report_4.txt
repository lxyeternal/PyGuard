{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction, possibly for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n2 in functions, although only n1 is defined in the code snippet, indicating missing or inconsistent data sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the results of calculations, but no direct data leak or external communication is evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n1, n2) flow into functions and produce output via return statements.",
  "anomalies": "Function definitions contain repeated parameter names (n1) instead of distinct parameters (n1, n2), indicating syntax errors. No other unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code has syntax errors due to reusing the same parameter name (n1) multiple times in function definitions, which would prevent successful execution. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, is detectable. The functions perform basic arithmetic operations. The comment at the top referencing 'Tahg && EsqueleSquad' appears to be a signature or label, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of faulty arithmetic functions with syntax errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code snippet.",
