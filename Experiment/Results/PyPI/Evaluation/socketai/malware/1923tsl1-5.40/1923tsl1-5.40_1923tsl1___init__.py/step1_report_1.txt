{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define simple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with multiple variants, possibly for different purposes or modules.",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n2 in each function, which are intended for arithmetic operations.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output the result of arithmetic operations; no data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n1, n2) flow into functions, which process and return results.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are poorly defined: parameter naming is inconsistent (e.g., 'n1' used twice, missing 'n2'), which would cause runtime errors. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system access, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple arithmetic functions with naming variants. However, there are syntax issues: parameters are incorrectly declared (e.g., 'n1: int, n1:int' should be 'n1: int, n2: int'), which indicates poorly written code but not malicious intent. No input validation, no external data sources, no suspicious behaviors. The header comments contain cryptic text but do not contribute to malicious analysis. Overall, the code is straightforward arithmetic functions with significant syntax errors but no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The main issues are syntax errors and poor coding practices, not malicious intent. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Confidence is high that this is benign but poorly written code.",
