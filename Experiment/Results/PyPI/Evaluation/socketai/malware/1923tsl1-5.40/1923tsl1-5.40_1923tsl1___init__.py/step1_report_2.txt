{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define multiple arithmetic functions, mainly addition and subtraction, with different suffixes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, such as n1 and n2 (although n2 is not explicitly defined in function signatures, indicating a potential issue).",
  "sinks": "Function return statements, which output the result of arithmetic operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in return statements; however, the functions contain errors in parameter naming and usage, which could lead to runtime issues but not security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The function signatures are inconsistent: parameters are named 'n1' twice, leading to syntax errors. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or input/output streams that indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions intended for arithmetic operations, but it contains syntax errors: parameters are incorrectly named (n1 repeated) and used without proper variable names (n2). No data leaks, external inputs, or malicious code are present. The functions seem to be simple math operations, but due to syntax issues, they won't execute correctly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains syntax errors and appears to be incomplete or improperly written. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely just poorly written arithmetic functions without malicious intent.",
