  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations from the Code:**\n\n- The code contains multiple functions intended for addition and subtraction, with naming variants (suma, resta, suma1, resta1, etc.).\n- There are clear syntax errors: parameters are declared as `n1: int, n1: int` instead of `n1: int, n2: int`. This would prevent execution.\n- Inside functions, variables like `n2` are referenced but not defined, indicating logical errors.\n- The comments mention \"Tahg && EsqueleSquad\" and a URL, but these are just labels or signatures, not malicious indicators.\n- No external data sources, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Correctly identifies simple arithmetic functions.\n- *Anomalies:* Correctly notes syntax errors: `n1` used twice, missing `n2`.\n- *Analysis & Conclusion:* Appropriately states code is poorly written but not malicious, with high confidence (0.8).\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Notes inconsistent parameter naming (`n1` twice), which is accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* Correctly highlights syntax issues and potential runtime errors.\n- *Analysis & Conclusion:* Appropriately states code is flawed, with no malicious activity.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly above zero but justified as code is flawed), obfuscated=0.\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No need to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Similar observations.\n- *Anomalies:* Repeats the syntax errors.\n- *Analysis & Conclusion:* Correctly concludes no malicious behavior, just flawed code.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Identifies parameter reuse issues.\n- *Anomalies:* Correctly notes syntax errors.\n- *Analysis & Conclusion:* No malicious activity; code is just faulty.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- *Purpose & Sources:* Notes parameter naming issues.\n- *Anomalies:* Correctly points out syntax errors.\n- *Analysis & Conclusion:* No malicious activity; code is poorly written but benign.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify syntax errors and poor coding practices.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly zero, justified by the lack of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation scores are zero, as code is straightforward but flawed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is not intentionally obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the syntax errors and poor quality but no malicious activity, a low risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) seems suitable. Some reports assign 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to syntax errors and poor coding, but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code's actual state. The code is flawed but not malicious. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- Set securityRisk around 0.1-0.2, reflecting code quality issues but no security threat.\n- Maintain confidence levels high, as no malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Work completed.**",
