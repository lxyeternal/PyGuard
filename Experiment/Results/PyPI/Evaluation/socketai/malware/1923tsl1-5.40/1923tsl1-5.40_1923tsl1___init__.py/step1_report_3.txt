{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define simple arithmetic functions (addition and subtraction) with various suffixes, possibly for basic calculations or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly present; the functions take parameters but do not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the functions only perform arithmetic operations on provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed into functions but are not used in any malicious manner; no data flow to external systems or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains repeated function definitions with inconsistent parameter names (e.g., n1, n2) which are not correctly declared. Specifically, the functions use 'n1' twice as parameters and refer to an undefined variable 'n2'. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple pairs of functions (suma and resta variants) intended for addition and subtraction. However, the functions are flawed: they reuse parameter names (n1) for multiple parameters, which is syntactically incorrect in Python. They also reference 'n2' inside the functions without defining it, indicating a logical or syntactical mistake. No external data sources, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities are evident. The code seems to be a basic, albeit flawed, implementation of arithmetic functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and contains logical errors but no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not pose security risks and appears to be a simple, possibly incomplete or incorrectly written, arithmetic module.",
