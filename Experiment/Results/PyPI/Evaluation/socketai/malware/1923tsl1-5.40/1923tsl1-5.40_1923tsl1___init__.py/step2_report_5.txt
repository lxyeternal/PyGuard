  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple functions for addition and subtraction, with various suffixes (suma, resta, suma1, resta1, etc.).\n- All functions have syntax issues: parameters are declared as `n1: int, n1: int` (repeating `n1`), which is invalid in Python; they should be `n1: int, n2: int`.\n- Inside functions, `n2` is referenced but not defined or passed as a parameter.\n- The functions perform straightforward arithmetic; no external data, network activity, or malicious code is evident.\n- The comments contain cryptic text, possibly signatures, but no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code contains syntax errors: duplicate parameter names and references to undefined variables (`n2`). These would prevent the code from executing correctly but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Malicious code or malware?**  \n  No. The code is simple arithmetic functions with syntax errors. No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The issues are syntactical and related to poor coding practices, not security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- Correctly identifies syntax issues and poor coding practices.\n- Concludes no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.8).\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Similar observations about syntax errors and lack of malicious behavior.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.7), security risk 0.2 (possibly due to syntax errors).\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Highlights syntax errors, incorrect parameter naming, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence high (0.9), malware 0.\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same as above; syntax errors, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence 0.8, malware 0.\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Same findings: syntax issues, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence 0.8, malware 0.\n- **Score assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is straightforward but poorly written.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is syntactically broken and non-functional, but not malicious, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated, just poorly written)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to syntax errors and poor quality, but no security threat)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is syntactically flawed but benign. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at 0.  \n- Obfuscated remains 0.  \n- Security risk should be very low, around 0.1, mainly due to poor coding quality, not malicious intent.",
