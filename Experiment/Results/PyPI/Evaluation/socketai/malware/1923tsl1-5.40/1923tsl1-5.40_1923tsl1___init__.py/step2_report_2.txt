  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines multiple functions intended for addition (`suma`, `suma1`, `suma12`, `suma123`) and subtraction (`resta`, `resta1`, `resta12`, `resta123`).\n- All functions are flawed: parameters are declared as `n1: int, n1: int` (repeated `n1`), which is invalid in Python and would cause syntax errors.\n- Inside functions, `n2` is referenced but never declared, indicating logical errors.\n- The functions perform straightforward arithmetic operations with no external data, no obfuscation, and no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the functions as simple arithmetic with variants.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes syntax errors due to improper parameter naming.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign but syntactically flawed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, identifies multiple arithmetic functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly points out syntax errors, inconsistent parameter naming, and the use of undefined `n2`.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just poorly written code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, arithmetic functions with suffix variants.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights repeated parameter names and undefined variables.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent, just syntax errors.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Anomalies:** Repeats previous findings; syntax errors due to parameter naming.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Same issues with parameter naming and undefined variables.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is syntactically flawed but benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The main issues are poor coding practices and syntax errors, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward, albeit poorly written.\n- **Risk score:** Given the syntax errors and poor quality, but no malicious behavior, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward, just poorly written)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (syntax errors and poor coding practices, but no security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a simple, flawed implementation of arithmetic functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is the syntax errors that prevent execution, but these do not imply malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the malware score should remain at 0, and the overall security risk should be minimal.",
