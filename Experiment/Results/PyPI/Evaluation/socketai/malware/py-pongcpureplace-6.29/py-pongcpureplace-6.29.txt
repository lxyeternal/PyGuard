      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup if a specific directory is missing. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and embedded URL strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores from the reports are appropriate; I recommend assigning a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation at 0.9, and security risk at 0.9 to reflect the high likelihood of malicious activity. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further analysis."
