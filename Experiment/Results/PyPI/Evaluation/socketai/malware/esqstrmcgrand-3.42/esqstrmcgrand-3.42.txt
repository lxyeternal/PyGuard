      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, with indicators such as URL, obfuscation, and error suppression. The scores in the reports are appropriate; slight upward adjustment in malware and risk scores is warranted to reflect the severity. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, and further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended for definitive analysis."
