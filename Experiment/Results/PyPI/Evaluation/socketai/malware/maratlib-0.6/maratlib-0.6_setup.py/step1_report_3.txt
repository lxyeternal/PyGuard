    "Repeated execution of external commands for remote script retrieval",
    "Unicode and string manipulation for obfuscation"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script first checks Python version. It then defines an obfuscated function l111_cringe_ that decodes a string and executes it via eval(). The code makes two calls to subprocess.getoutput, each running shell commands that download a script from a GitHub URL, change its permissions to be executable, and run it with bash. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote script fetching strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to execute harmful shell scripts without user consent. These activities are consistent with malicious supply chain behavior, aiming to run remote malicious code on the target system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including obfuscated decoding, dynamic evaluation, and executing remotely fetched scripts with insecure permissions. It is highly likely to be malicious, designed to compromise the system by executing external shell scripts. This code should be considered dangerous and not used.",
