  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The check for 'tahg' directory and the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which can lead to remote code execution or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Directory check ('tahg') → conditional execution of PowerShell command → command runs silently with hidden window.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent error handling, execution during package setup, broad try-except blocks hiding errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check, and if absent, executes an obfuscated PowerShell command silently. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique. The execution is hidden and silent, with broad exception handling that suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious failures. The setup() call appears standard but is wrapped in try-except, which could conceal malicious interference. The overall pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or backdoors during package installation. The suspicion is high due to the obfuscation, silent execution, and concealment tactics. Without decoding the PowerShell command, certainty cannot be absolute, but the indicators strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell code during setup, representing a high security risk and likely malicious activity. It should be flagged for further analysis, and the encoded command should be decoded to confirm malicious payloads.",
