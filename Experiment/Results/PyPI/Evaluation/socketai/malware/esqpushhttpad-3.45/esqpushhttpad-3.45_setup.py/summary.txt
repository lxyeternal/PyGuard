  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The embedded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing external payloads. The high obfuscation and execution context justify high malware and risk scores. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further decoding and validation are performed."
