  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered during package setup. The suspicious URL, stealth flags, and silent error handling reinforce this assessment. The package should be considered malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms its intent."
