  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, triggered by a filesystem check. The pattern aligns with malicious behavior, such as remote code execution or payload download. The high scores are justified; the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
