  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with malicious data exfiltration of seed phrases, with high security and malware risk scores justified by the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive information. However, it does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The high risk and malware scores reflect the severity of exposing seed phrases without encryption or user awareness."
