  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via Telegram API for authorization or notification purposes.",
  "sources": "User input from the input() function: 'type 12 seed phrases for authorization'.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST request to Telegram API endpoint with the seed phrases as message content.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in 'secret_words' -> concatenated into 'message' -> sent via requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which could be exploited if exposed. The code sends sensitive seed phrases directly over an external API without any encryption or user consent considerations. No validation or encryption of the seed phrases, increasing risk of leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases, which are then concatenated into a message. The message is sent via a Telegram bot API request. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, which is a security concern. The user input is directly sent to an external service without validation or encryption, potentially exposing sensitive seed phrases. No obfuscation or malicious logic like data exfiltration, backdoors, or remote command execution is present. The primary concern is the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive information, which could be exploited if the token or data is intercepted or accessed maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main issue is the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive seed phrases using hardcoded credentials and an unencrypted API call. It does not contain malicious code but presents significant security risks related to privacy and data leakage. The overall risk is moderate due to the exposure of sensitive information, but it does not appear malicious beyond negligence.",
