  "purpose": "The code appears to collect 12 seed phrases from the user and send them via a Telegram bot message.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function to obtain seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data (seed phrases) to the Telegram API endpoint.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> seed phrases stored in secret_words -> message constructed -> sent to Telegram API endpoint via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are directly taken from user input and immediately transmitted over the network without any encryption or validation, indicating potential privacy and security risks. Hardcoded bot token and chat ID present a security risk. No input validation beyond length check, no encryption, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases, which are then concatenated into a message and sent via Telegram API. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, making the credentials exposed. The seed phrases are transmitted in plain text, which could lead to privacy leaks if the code is misused or compromised. The script does not validate the seed phrases beyond counting, nor does it obfuscate or encrypt the data before transmission. The use of requests.post() sends sensitive data directly to an external service without safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive seed phrases from the user and transmits them unencrypted to a Telegram chat, exposing critical security and privacy vulnerabilities. The presence of hardcoded credentials and direct transmission of seed phrases indicate malicious intent or poor security hygiene, potentially enabling theft of user funds if misused.",
