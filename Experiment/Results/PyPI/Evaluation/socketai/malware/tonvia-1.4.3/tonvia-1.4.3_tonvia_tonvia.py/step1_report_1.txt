{
  "purpose": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases for authorization and sends these seed phrases as a message via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "User input through the input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API with the seed phrases as message content.",
  "flows": "User input (seed phrases) -> message string -> requests.post to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive seed phrase data directly to a Telegram chat, which is a security concern. The seed phrases are hardcoded into the script, and there is no validation or encryption, which can be considered suspicious. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input, concatenates them into a message, and sends this message via a Telegram bot. The seed phrases are sensitive information, and their transmission to an external service (Telegram) without encryption or user consent indicates a potential privacy breach or malicious intent. The script lacks validation beyond the seed count and does not sanitize input. It directly exposes sensitive data over the network. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code beyond the insecure handling of secret seed phrases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to send sensitive seed phrases to an external Telegram chat, which constitutes a significant privacy and security risk. This behavior could be malicious if intended for credential theft or privacy violations. The overall risk score is high due to transmission of sensitive data in plain text. No malware or obfuscation signs are present, but the security implications are severe.",
