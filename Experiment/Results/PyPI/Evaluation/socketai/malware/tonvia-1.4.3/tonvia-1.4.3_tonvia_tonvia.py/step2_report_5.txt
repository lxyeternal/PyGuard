  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases and then sends them via Telegram API.\n- The code contains hardcoded bot token and chat ID.\n- The seed phrases are transmitted in plain text, unencrypted.\n- No validation or sanitization beyond seed count.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected besides insecure handling.\n- The primary concern is privacy breach and potential misuse, not necessarily malware.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Sends sensitive data directly; no encryption; hardcoded credentials.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; security risk is high.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; indicates privacy/security breach, not malware.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.7 — Slightly high, but no malicious code present.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.8 — Justified due to data exfiltration.\n  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores, though malware score could be slightly lower, as no malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies:** Same issues.\n- **Analysis:** Similar; emphasizes privacy leak.\n- **Conclusion:** Similar; no malicious code, just negligence.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.4 — Slightly lower, which is appropriate.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.8 — Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malware, but high security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same.\n- **Conclusion:** Same.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — No malware.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.7 — Slightly lower, but still high.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same.\n- **Conclusion:** Same.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 1 — Overstated; no malicious code.\n  - SecurityRisk: 1 — Justified, as sensitive data is exfiltrated.\n\n**Verdict:** Malware score should be **lowered** to reflect the absence of malicious code. It's more of a privacy/security concern than malware.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same.\n- **Conclusion:** Same.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.9 — Slightly high; no malicious code.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.9 — Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Similar to above; malware score could be slightly lower.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring considerations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** The code does not contain any malicious payload, backdoors, or remote command execution. It simply exfiltrates seed phrases via Telegram. Therefore, **malware scores should be significantly lower**, perhaps around 0.1 to 0.2, unless the context suggests malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly indicate no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risk score:** The high scores are justified due to privacy breach and insecure handling of sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0.1             | 0                 | 0.8        |\n| 2       | 0.1             | 0                 | 0.8        |\n| 3       | 0.1             | 0                 | 0.7        |\n| 4       | 0.1             | 0                 | 0.9        |\n| 5       | 0.1             | 0                 | 0.9        |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is **not malware** but **highly insecure and privacy-invasive**.\n- The primary concern is **exfiltration of sensitive seed phrases** without encryption or user consent.\n- The **malware score** should be **low (~0.1)** because no malicious payload or behavior beyond insecure data handling is present.\n- The **security risk score** remains **high (~0.8-0.9)** due to the privacy breach.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code should be flagged for security negligence and potential misuse, but not for malware.",
