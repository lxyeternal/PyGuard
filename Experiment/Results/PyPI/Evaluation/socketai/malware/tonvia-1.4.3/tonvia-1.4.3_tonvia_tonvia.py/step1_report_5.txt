  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from the user and sends them as a message via a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint to send a message containing the seed phrases.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in 'secret_words' -> concatenated into 'message' -> sent via requests.post() to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, sensitive data being sent in plain text over network, lack of input validation beyond length check, no encryption or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases, which are then stored in a list. It verifies that exactly 12 phrases are entered; otherwise, it terminates. The seed phrases are concatenated into a message string and sent via a POST request to the Telegram Bot API using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The direct inclusion of the bot token and chat ID within the code constitutes a security risk as these credentials could be exploited. The seed phrases are transmitted in plain text without any encryption or obfuscation, making it susceptible to interception. The code does not include any measures to prevent misuse, logging, or encryption, indicating a potential security concern if misused or deployed maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases by sending them over the network via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded credentials and plain-text transmission indicates malicious intent or at least significant security negligence. It could be used maliciously to steal user seed phrases and send them to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. The overall security risk is high due to these factors.",
