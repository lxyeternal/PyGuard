  "purpose": "Collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via Telegram API.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Input collection → message concatenation → POST request to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID; transmitting sensitive seed phrases in plaintext; no encryption or validation beyond seed count.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts for seed phrases, verifies count, then sends the combined seed phrases to a Telegram chat using hardcoded credentials. No obfuscation or malicious code is present, but it exfiltrates highly sensitive data insecurely. The transmission occurs in plaintext without encryption, and credentials are exposed in code, constituting a significant security and privacy risk. The behavior aligns with data exfiltration, which could be malicious if done without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with malicious data exfiltration of seed phrases, with high security and malware risk scores justified by the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive information. However, it does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The high risk and malware scores reflect the severity of exposing seed phrases without encryption or user awareness.",
