The only suspicious element is the Telegram URL, which should be verified but does not impact the code's security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the metadata concern but no active threat."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with malicious data exfiltration of seed phrases, with high security and malware risk scores justified by the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive information. However, it does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The high risk and malware scores reflect the severity of exposing seed phrases without encryption or user awareness."

      "confidence": 0.5,
      "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign; the security risk hinges on the implementation of 'a()' in 'tonvia'. Without further context, the snippet does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score due to uncertainty about 'a()'. Further review of 'tonvia.a' is recommended for a definitive assessment."
