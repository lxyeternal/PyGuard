{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'tonvia' including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or untrusted data at runtime; however, 'long_description' reads from 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating potential security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'README.md' during setup is common; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. URL points to a Telegram link, which could be suspicious if used maliciously, but not inherently malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package info, dependencies, and metadata. The 'long_description' reads from a local README.md file, a common practice. The URL points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for open-source project links but not malicious by itself. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. No input sources or sinks that could be exploited or lead to data leakage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a Telegram URL is noteworthy but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
