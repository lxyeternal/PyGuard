  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; uses package metadata fields; URL field containing a Telegram link.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime data processing or network operations; only metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL pointing to a Telegram link; no error handling for 'README.md' read; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and configuring package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only notable anomaly is the URL pointing to a Telegram link, which is unconventional for package metadata but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the unusual URL. The code does not perform any runtime actions or data leaks. The main concern is the metadata URL, which could be used for malicious communication outside the scope of this code, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only suspicious element is the Telegram URL, which should be verified but does not impact the code's security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the metadata concern but no active threat.",
