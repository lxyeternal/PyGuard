  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tonvia' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from 'README.md', and package dependencies ('requests').",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Reads long description from file, then passes static configuration to setup() function; no dynamic data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for a package repository; no code obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations using setuptools, including reading a README file for the long description. No input from external sources other than reading static files, and no code executes external commands or handles untrusted input. The URL is suspicious as it points to a Telegram link, which is uncommon for package URLs, but does not constitute malicious code itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The only notable point is the unconventional URL, which may warrant further verification but does not imply malicious intent.",
