  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'tonvia' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata, dependencies, and reads the content of 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content as long_description during setup; no other data flow concerns.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for package metadata but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script. It specifies package details and dependencies without any dynamic or malicious code. The reading of 'README.md' is typical for long description. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no obfuscation or malware-like patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and straightforward with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
