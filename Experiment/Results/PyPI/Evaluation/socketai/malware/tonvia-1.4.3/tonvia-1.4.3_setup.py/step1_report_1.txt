  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration does not perform data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' to populate long_description, then passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without error handling; the URL points to a Telegram link which could be suspicious or meant for phishing, but it alone does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads a README file for a long description. The code is straightforward and common in package distribution. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The URL provided (a Telegram link) might be unconventional for a package, but it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior without further context. There are no embedded code injections, environment manipulations, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the inclusion of a Telegram URL, which could be used for phishing or malicious communication, but as part of a package metadata, it does not indicate malware or malicious intent by itself.",
