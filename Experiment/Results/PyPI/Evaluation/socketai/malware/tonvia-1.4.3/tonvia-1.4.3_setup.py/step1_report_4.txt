{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonvia' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The package reads 'README.md' for long description, and the code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The 'open' function reads a file, but no untrusted input or external data is used at runtime that affects behavior.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters, including package metadata and dependencies, are static and predefined; no dynamic or external data flow affecting security.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. The URL points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for package hosting but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads a README file for long description, specifies dependencies, and includes metadata such as author and URL. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of an external URL (Telegram) is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only point of note is the URL pointing to a Telegram link, which is unusual but not malicious in itself.",
