  "purpose": "Import and execute function 'a' from local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tonvia, calling function 'a()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could perform any action depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import from .tonvia -> call 'a()' directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module and calls it immediately. The behavior and potential risks depend entirely on the implementation of 'a()' within 'tonvia', which is not provided. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree that the snippet itself is benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting uncertainty about 'a()' but no evidence of malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is moderate (~0.5), given the lack of implementation details. No immediate security threats are apparent from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign; the security risk hinges on the implementation of 'a()' in 'tonvia'. Without further context, the snippet does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score due to uncertainty about 'a()'. Further review of 'tonvia.a' is recommended for a definitive assessment.",
