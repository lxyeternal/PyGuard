  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.5,
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign; the security risk hinges on the implementation of 'a()' in 'tonvia'. Without further context, the snippet does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low risk score due to uncertainty about 'a()'. Further review of 'tonvia.a' is recommended for a definitive assessment."
