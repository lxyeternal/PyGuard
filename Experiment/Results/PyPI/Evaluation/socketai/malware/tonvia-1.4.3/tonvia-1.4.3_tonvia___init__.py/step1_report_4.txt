{
  "purpose": "Import and execute a function 'a' from the local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'tonvia' and calls function 'a'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'a()' could potentially be a sink if 'a' performs malicious actions when invoked.",
  "flows": "Import of 'tonvia' -> execution of 'a()' -> potential malicious activity if 'a' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any obfuscated patterns or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function 'a' from a relative module 'tonvia' and then calls it. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior directly visible. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'a()' within 'tonvia', which is not provided. Without the implementation details, it is impossible to definitively identify malicious activity. The code itself is straightforward and standard in form.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a simple import and call statement. The overall security risk is low, but caution should be taken if the implementation of 'a()' in 'tonvia' is malicious.",
