{
  "purpose": "Import and execute function 'a' from the local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; invocation of function 'a'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of function 'a' which may contain untrusted operations or side effects.",
  "flows": "Import of 'a' from '.tonvia' -> Call to 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context about the content of 'a'; minimal code present, but potential concern depends on 'a' implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'a' from a local module 'tonvia' and immediately calls it. The code itself is minimal, and without inspecting the 'tonvia' module, we cannot determine if 'a' contains malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible here. The behavior depends entirely on the implementation of 'a' in 'tonvia'.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is straightforward: it imports and runs a function from a local module. No malicious behavior is evident in this snippet alone; however, the security of the operation depends on the implementation of 'a' within 'tonvia'. No indicators of malware or security risks are visible here.",
