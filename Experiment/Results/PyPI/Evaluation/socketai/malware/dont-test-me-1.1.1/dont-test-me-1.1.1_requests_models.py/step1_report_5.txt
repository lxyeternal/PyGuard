{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods related to constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses, primarily for the Requests library in Python. It facilitates request creation, URL parsing, header setting, body encoding, and response processing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings, headers, data, files, JSON objects, cookies, and hooks provided by the user during request instantiation and preparation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request body (self.body), headers (self.headers), URL construction, and hooks execution. Response content (self._content) and text are also sinks where decoded response data is processed and returned.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (url, headers, data, json, files, cookies, hooks) through preparation methods (prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body, prepare_cookies, prepare_hooks), ultimately into request bodies, headers, or URL strings. Response flows include reading self.raw to populate self._content, decoding, and parsing JSON, with possible error handling at each step.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code strictly handles HTTP request/response mechanics. It does include error handling and encoding logic but nothing unusual. There is an extensive use of try-except blocks for decoding and encoding, but these are standard. No suspicious or malicious code such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or code injections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of HTTP request/response handling, including URL parsing, header validation, body encoding (including multipart forms), cookie management, and response content processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The methods focus on request preparation, URL normalization, and safe handling of response data. All operations are consistent with standard HTTP client functionality. No obfuscated or suspicious logic detected. The code performs expected tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for HTTP request and response handling within the Requests library. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage code. It handles request creation, encoding, and response parsing securely and predictably. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
