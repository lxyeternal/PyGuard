{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, including URL parsing, encoding, request preparation, and response decoding, with no malicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks; also reads from request bodies and response raw streams.",
  "sinks": "Request body, headers, cookies, response content, and response headers, which could potentially leak data if misused, but are handled securely here.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into URL construction, encoding functions, request body assembly, and response processing; no suspicious or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine request/response handling with proper encoding, URL parsing, error handling, and hook management. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security practices are standard, and the code is free from suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores (close to 1) for non-maliciousness are justified. The minimal security risk score (~0.05) reflects inherent risks in request handling but no actual threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-implemented HTTP client module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
