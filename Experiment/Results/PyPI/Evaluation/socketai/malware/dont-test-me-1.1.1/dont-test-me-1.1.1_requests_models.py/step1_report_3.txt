{
  "purpose": "This module defines the core objects and utilities for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method, url, headers, files, data, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks, and raw response content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include HTTP headers, request body, URL parameters, and response content, which could be exploited if untrusted data is mishandled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters into request construction (prepare methods), which then produce a request to be sent, and responses are processed through iter_content, iter_lines, and content/json properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code handles standard HTTP request/response processing, URL encoding, and multipart data encoding. No obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to standard request/response processing practices. URL encoding and parameter handling use standard libraries and functions. The preparation of headers, cookies, and auth involves standard procedures. Response handling includes safe content decoding, JSON parsing with exception handling, and status-based error raising. No malicious or sabotage behavior, data leaks, or unsafe operations are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation for HTTP request/response handling within the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for HTTP request construction and response handling without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious anomalies. Overall, it appears safe and well-structured.",
