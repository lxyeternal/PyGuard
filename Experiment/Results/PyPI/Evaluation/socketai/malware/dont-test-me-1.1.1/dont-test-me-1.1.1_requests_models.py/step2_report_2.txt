  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation of request/response handling with no malicious or obfuscated code. The confidence is high (0.95), and no malware or security risks are identified.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code, which appears to be a typical, well-structured HTTP client implementation. No suspicious behavior or hidden payloads are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious logic, and proper handling of request/response.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are found.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly above zero, possibly to account for minimal risk, but overall acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code appears standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The confidence is high (0.9), and the security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No signs of malicious activity or code anomalies.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP request/response handler with no malicious features. Confidence is perfect (1.0).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard request/response handling, no signs of malicious activity, high confidence.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is a typical implementation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code contains no suspicious or malicious logic. I agree with these assessments.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's nature, I concur.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.0** — No evident security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary to the scores provided in the reports. They are consistent with the code review.",
