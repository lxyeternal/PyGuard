{
  "purpose": "This module provides an HTTP request library, facilitating HTTP GET, POST, and other methods, along with dependency compatibility checks and environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Versions and import statements for dependencies (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, cryptography), import of system modules (warnings, ssl, logging), internal package imports.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communications with untrusted endpoints or data leaks. No processing of untrusted input directly leading to system effects.",
  "flows": "Dependency version checks and environment configuration flow from source variables (versions, import states) to conditional assertions, warnings, and environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dependency checks with assertions that may raise errors if versions mismatch; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs; dependency warnings are benign. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency version verification for urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, and cryptography, raising warnings or exceptions if incompatible. It attempts to configure SSL support, suppresses urllib3 warnings, and sets up logging. All actions are consistent with normal library setup procedures. No data is read from external untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that process untrusted data maliciously. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup and compatibility checking module for an HTTP library, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. It ensures dependency compatibility and environment readiness. No security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
