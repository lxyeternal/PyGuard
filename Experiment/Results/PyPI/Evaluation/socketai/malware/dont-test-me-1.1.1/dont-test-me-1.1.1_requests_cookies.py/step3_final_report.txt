  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library, including extraction from responses, creation, merging, and header generation.",
  "sources": "Response headers, request headers, input parameters for cookie creation and management functions.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar objects, request headers, internal cookie storage.",
  "flows": "Response headers → CookieJar extraction → CookieJar → request headers for subsequent requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including extracting cookies from response headers, creating cookies from parameters, merging cookie jars, and generating cookie headers for requests. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident; functions operate solely on cookie data. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The threading fallback is standard practice. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The potential for misuse exists if external input is malicious, but this is typical for such libraries and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for cookie handling within the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its purpose and content.",
