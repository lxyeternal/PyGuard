  ],
  "flows": [
    "Input from request objects (via headers, URL, or parameters) flows into MockRequest and MockResponse objects used in cookie extraction.",
    "Cookies are created via create_cookie or morsel_to_cookie functions and stored in RequestsCookieJar.",
    "Cookies can be merged or updated from external dicts or other CookieJars, flowing into the internal cookie store.",
    "get_cookie_header retrieves cookie data to be sent with requests, potentially including sensitive data.",
    "Functions like extract_cookies_to_jar process response headers into the cookie jar."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of the 'HttpOnly' attribute in cookie creation is standard but is set to None in default, which is benign.",
    "The code contains no hardcoded credentials or sensitive secrets.",
    "Functions such as create_cookie and morsel_to_cookie process input parameters that could be manipulated, but they do not inherently perform malicious actions.",
    "No obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or suspicious runtime behaviors are present.",
    "The code is primarily for cookie management and compatibility, with no suspicious network or system modification activities."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides cookie handling utilities for the requests library, including classes for cookie storage and functions for extracting, setting, and merging cookies. All operations relate to standard cookie management tasks: creating cookies, converting from Morsel objects, extracting cookies from response headers, and providing dict-like access to cookies. No parts of the code perform network communication beyond standard cookie header processing, nor do they execute code dynamically or access sensitive data such as environment variables. The code appears to be a straightforward, compatibility-focused implementation for cookie management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions are designed for legitimate cookie handling in HTTP workflows, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard utility module for managing cookies within the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It provides compatibility and convenience functions/classes for cookie handling, with no network anomalies, backdoors, or malicious data leaks detected.",
