  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric values to metadata variables (__title__, __description__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink, just static assignments)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains only metadata variable assignments, no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static metadata declarations for the requests package. No input/output, no execution, no dynamic or obfuscated code. The presence of ASCII art at the top is purely decorative and not suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless metadata documentation for the requests package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
