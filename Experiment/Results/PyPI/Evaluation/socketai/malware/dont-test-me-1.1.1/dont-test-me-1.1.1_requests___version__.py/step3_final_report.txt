  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, license, and decorative ASCII art and emojis.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata and decorative comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, input, or output processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignments do not process or transfer untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art and emojis are purely stylistic and do not affect code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata and decorative comments. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and harmless nature. No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static declaration of package metadata with decorative elements. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered entirely safe.",
