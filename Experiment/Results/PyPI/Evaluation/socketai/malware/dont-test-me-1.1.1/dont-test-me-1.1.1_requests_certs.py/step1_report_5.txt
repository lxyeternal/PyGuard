{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, mainly for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source 'where' function is called, and its output (the certificate bundle path) is printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly retrieves and displays the CA bundle path without any suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from a well-known package (certifi) and prints the result. There are no hardcoded secrets, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The functionality aligns with common practices for SSL verification setups. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script used to display the default CA certificate bundle path, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
