{
  "purpose": "The code returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data flow or data leakage present.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function's output flows directly to the standard output via print().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward usage of a well-known library function. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed as the main module. The code does not process untrusted input, modify data, or perform any network or file operations beyond displaying a known, static file path. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code simply reports the location of a trusted CA bundle.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the default CA bundle provided by the certifi package. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
