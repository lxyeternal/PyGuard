  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the certifi package; calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only outputs a file path.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from certifi -> calling 'where()' -> printing the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, only retrieves and prints a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted library 'certifi' and calls its 'where()' function to print the path to the CA bundle. There are no input sources, user data, or untrusted data involved. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code's intent appears to be providing a utility to display the CA bundle path, which is benign. No security risks, malware behavior, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from the certifi package. No malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
