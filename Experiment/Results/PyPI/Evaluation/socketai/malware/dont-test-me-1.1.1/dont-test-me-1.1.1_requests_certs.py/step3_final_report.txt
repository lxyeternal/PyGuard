  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi'; execution of 'print(where())' when run as main.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The script calls 'where()' and outputs its result; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library function and prints its output. It performs no input processing, network activity, or data modification. All reports correctly interpret the script as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that reports the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
