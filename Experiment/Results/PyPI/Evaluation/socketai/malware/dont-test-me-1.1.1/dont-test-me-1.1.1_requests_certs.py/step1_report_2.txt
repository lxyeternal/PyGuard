  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle using certifi, primarily for requests or other SSL-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'print(where())' to output the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print() output of the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of certifi to locate CA bundle. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi to locate the CA certificate bundle path and prints it when run directly. The code is simple, clear, and does not perform any network operations, data collection, or sensitive operations. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious logic. Its purpose is to expose the default CA bundle path, useful in packaging or deployment scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of exposing the default CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
