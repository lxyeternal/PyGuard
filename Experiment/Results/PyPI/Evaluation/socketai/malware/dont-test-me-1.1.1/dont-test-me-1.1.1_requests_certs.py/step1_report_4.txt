  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA bundle used for SSL verification in HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The 'where()' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects; the code only prints a path.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function is called, returning a CA bundle path, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; straightforward retrieval and display of a standard resource.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi', which returns the path to the CA certificate bundle. It then prints this path if run as a script. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. The purpose appears to be to display the default CA bundle location. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, non-malicious, and serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL certificate verification. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
