{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and importing modules in a backward-compatible manner.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookies, io.StringIO, urllib.parse, urllib.request, standard Python built-ins.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data outputs or external communications are directly present in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly import and compatibility logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs. The code consists of standard compatibility shims and imports, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility imports and setup for different Python versions, using try-except blocks to handle optional dependencies. It imports modules for JSON handling, collections, HTTP cookies, URL parsing, and other utilities. No data is processed or transmitted. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module intended to provide compatibility and common utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs safe, standard imports and compatibility handling without any suspicious logic.",
