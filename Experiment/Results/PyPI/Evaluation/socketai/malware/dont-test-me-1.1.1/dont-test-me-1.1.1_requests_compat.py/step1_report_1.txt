{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as resolving dependencies for JSON handling and HTTP utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "The import statements could potentially introduce untrusted modules if the environment is compromised, but this is standard behavior. No data sinks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "The code loads modules for compatibility and utility functions, with no flow involving untrusted data or external inputs being processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard compatibility practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily focuses on importing various modules and defining compatibility variables. It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' based on availability, and 'simplejson' or 'json' for JSON parsing, which is a common pattern. It defines some utility variables for Python version detection and imports standard library modules. No data processing, network operations, or data leaks are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. All code appears to be standard and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import utility module with no malicious or suspicious activity. It is safe and typical for supporting legacy Python environments and JSON handling. No security risks are identified.",
