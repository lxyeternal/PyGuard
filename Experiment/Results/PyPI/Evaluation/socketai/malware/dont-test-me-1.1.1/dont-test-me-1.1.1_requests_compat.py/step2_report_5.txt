  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code handles compatibility across Python 2 and 3.\n- It conditionally imports 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.\n- It conditionally imports 'simplejson' or 'json'.\n- It sets version flags and defines some type aliases.\n- It imports standard modules for URL parsing, HTTP proxies, cookies, and collections.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard compatibility utility module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code performs safe, standard imports and compatibility handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The code follows best practices for compatibility and optional dependency handling.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None. All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain any malicious payloads. The malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe the code's purpose and behavior, which is safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's benign and compatibility-focused nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-understood compatibility shim with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' assessments. The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a compatibility purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and standard for its purpose.",
