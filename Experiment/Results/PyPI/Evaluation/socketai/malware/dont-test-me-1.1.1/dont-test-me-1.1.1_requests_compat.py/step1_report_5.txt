{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and Python 3, along with import resolution for various standard libraries and dependencies such as 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and optional third-party libraries such as 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and sys.version_info for environment info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code mainly handles imports and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static, and version info is retrieved from sys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily manages compatibility and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports optional and standard libraries, manages compatibility between Python versions, and assigns some common type variables. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or execute untrusted code. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import management module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger, well-structured library.",
