  "purpose": "Compatibility and environment setup for Python 2 and 3, handling optional dependencies and defining version-specific variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, sys, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data transmission operations",
  "flows": "Importing optional modules -> setting version flags -> defining compatibility variables",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and compatibility code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility imports, version detection, and optional dependency handling. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, well-understood boilerplate code for supporting legacy Python environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility module with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. No adjustments are necessary.",
