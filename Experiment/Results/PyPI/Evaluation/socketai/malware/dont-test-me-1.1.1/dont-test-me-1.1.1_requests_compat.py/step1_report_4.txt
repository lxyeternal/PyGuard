{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility shims and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing necessary libraries for HTTP and JSON processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, collections, http, io, urllib), conditional import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', and optional 'simplejson' library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; all data flows involve standard library functions and module imports.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows present; code initializes compatibility variables and imports modules for HTTP and JSON processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code primarily handles imports and compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'chardet' with fallback to 'charset_normalizer' for character encoding detection, which is a standard practice. It dynamically imports 'simplejson' if available, otherwise defaults to 'json', which is common for JSON handling. Compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3 are set up. It imports various modules for URL handling and HTTP proxies, and sets up type aliases for compatibility. All operations are standard and do not involve processing untrusted input or executing arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and import setup for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It solely manages module imports and compatibility shims without executing untrusted data or performing risky operations.",
