  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is primarily about compatibility imports and environment setup.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected—no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n- The code uses standard, well-understood patterns for handling optional dependencies and Python version differences.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which matches the clear, standard structure.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, indicating no security issues.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Since all reports agree and the code is standard compatibility boilerplate, I see no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the straightforwardness and standard practices observed.\n\n**Risk justification:**\n\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- Importing modules like 'chardet', 'charset_normalizer', or 'simplejson' is common and safe.\n- The code's purpose is purely compatibility and setup, with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's benign, compatibility-focused purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive; I concur with their assessments.",
