{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is provided via constructor arguments for CaseInsensitiveDict, or through attribute access and method calls (e.g., __getitem__, get).",
  "sinks": "Data is retrieved via __getitem__, get, and other methods; no direct untrusted data sink operations like network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to constructors or __getitem__ flows into internal storage; data retrieval methods access internal dicts, but no external or network operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The copy method may incorrectly implement copying (returns self._store.values(), which is not a dict).",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard case-insensitive dict behavior and a simple lookup dictionary. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is present. The classes rely on standard library features. The copy method appears flawed (returns values view instead of a proper copy), but this is not malicious. No external data flows, no code that manipulates or exfiltrates data, and no suspicious side-effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing utility data structures for internal use within Requests. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
