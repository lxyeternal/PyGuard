  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. The code primarily involves class inheritance, attribute initialization, and import statements. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The classes are standard and serve as error handling mechanisms.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   No report indicates any logical errors or flaws. The constructors correctly initialize attributes, and inheritance appears appropriate. The code adheres to Python standards for defining custom exceptions. No anomalies, such as suspicious patterns or obfuscation, are noted.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code. No malicious behavior is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no execution of untrusted code or data, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Assigning anything higher would imply potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which is not supported.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to security issues. The exception classes are standard and do not introduce attack vectors.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy for the Requests library. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
