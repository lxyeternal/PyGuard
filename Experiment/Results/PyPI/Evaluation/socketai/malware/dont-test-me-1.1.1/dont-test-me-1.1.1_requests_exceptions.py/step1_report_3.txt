  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3.exceptions and .compat.JSONDecodeError; class constructors and methods accessing response/request attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be involved in response/request attributes or error messages, but no direct data leaks or untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised in response to HTTP errors, connection issues, or invalid URLs; no complex data flow or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for request handling errors, with constructors initializing error details. The import statements and class inheritance seem standard. No code execution, data manipulation, or suspicious behavior present. The structure follows typical Python exception definitions for a library, and no parts appear malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks detected. It appears safe and normal.",
