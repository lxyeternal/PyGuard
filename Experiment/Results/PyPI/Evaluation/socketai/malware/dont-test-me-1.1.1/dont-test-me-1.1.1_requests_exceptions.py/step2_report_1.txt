  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the details and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for the Requests library.\n- The code is straightforward, with inheritance from standard Python exceptions and some imported exceptions.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign error handling module.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are evident.\n   - The exception classes are standard and do not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely defining exception classes; no potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious logic, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - The exception classes are standard and do not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state the code's benign purpose.\n   - No speculative claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven the code's clarity and benign purpose, I concur with the provided scores. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It is free from malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores appropriately reflect the code's safety.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
