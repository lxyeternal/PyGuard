{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to HTTP requests made using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code primarily imports exception classes from other modules and defines new exception classes, with no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "The exception classes could be used to handle untrusted input data during error handling, but they do not perform any data leaks or malicious actions by themselves.",
  "flows": "The code does not process untrusted data; it simply defines exception hierarchies for error handling in HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The class definitions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The module provides structured exception classes for request errors, importing external exception classes and extending them with custom classes. The code follows standard Python patterns for exception class definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No user input handling or network activity occurs within this code; it serves as a foundation for error handling in the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
