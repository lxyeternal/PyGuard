{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various errors related to HTTP requests within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Exception instantiations, attribute access such as response.request, and inheritance from standard Python exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no code writes untrusted data to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are created and possibly propagated; no data flow involves untrusted input directly affecting system behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured exception classes for error handling, inheriting from standard exceptions and other imported exception classes. The constructors initialize attributes based on passed arguments, with some inheritance from third-party exception classes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The import statements are straightforward, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a request-handling library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. The module appears to be a benign, well-structured error handling component.",
