  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe this module as a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- They highlight that the code imports exceptions, defines custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions or other imported exceptions, and initializes attributes appropriately.\n- No code patterns, data flows, or behaviors suggest malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- The code is described as benign, well-structured, and typical for an error handling component in a network library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malware or suspicious activity:** None detected; the code is purely class definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified because the code does not perform any risky operations, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The constructors, inheritance, and import statements are all standard.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any I/O operations.\n- The exception hierarchy is typical and does not contain any suspicious logic.\n- No dynamic code, code injection, or obfuscation techniques are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The consistent high confidence (1) across reports aligns with the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n- The absence of any suspicious patterns or behaviors confirms that this is a safe, standard component.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for the Requests library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.",
