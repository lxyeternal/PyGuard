{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors, including decoding and timeout issues.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily the parameters passed to the exception constructors, and external library exceptions (urllib3.exceptions).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code primarily defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are created with data from external sources or internal code; no complex or risky data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code structure and comments are consistent with standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling various errors within the Requests library, including HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, and warnings. It uses standard Python inheritance and constructors. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The exception classes do not perform any operations beyond initialization and inheritance. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module for error handling without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malware or security risks. It functions to handle expected error conditions in HTTP requests. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
