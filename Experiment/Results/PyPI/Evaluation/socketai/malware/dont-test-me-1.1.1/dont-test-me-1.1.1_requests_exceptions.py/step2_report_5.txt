  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling within the Requests library.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data leaks, or handling of untrusted input beyond exception class definitions.\n- Import statements are straightforward, importing from standard or well-known modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve as error handling mechanisms.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is in the `JSONDecodeError` constructor, which calls `CompatJSONDecodeError.__init__` and then `InvalidJSONError.__init__`. This pattern is acceptable but slightly unusual; however, it doesn't introduce security issues. It’s a common pattern for multiple inheritance where the parent classes are designed accordingly.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5. Since no malicious or risky behavior is present, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes without any dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing, a **risk score of 0** is justified.\n- No reason to increase the risk score unless future context indicates otherwise.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is safe, with high confidence.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is consistent with the detailed review and the consensus in the reports.",
