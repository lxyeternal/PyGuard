  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility shim, manipulating sys.modules to ensure legacy module paths. It does not contain malicious payloads or active malicious intent. The module remapping could be exploited if environment is compromised, but as-is, it is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware remains at 0, obfuscation is low to moderate, and security risk is moderate due to the module hijacking potential."
