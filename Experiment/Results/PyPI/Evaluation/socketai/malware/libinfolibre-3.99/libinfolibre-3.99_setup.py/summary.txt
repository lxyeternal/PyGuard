  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package installation, indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and external URL comment support this. The assigned scores are justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms its behavior."
