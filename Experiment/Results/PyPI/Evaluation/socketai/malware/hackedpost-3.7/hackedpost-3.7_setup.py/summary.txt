  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution conditioned on a file check, combined with suspicious package metadata. The high obfuscation and execution behavior justify a malware score of 0.85, a obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9."
