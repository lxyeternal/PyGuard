{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to execute a concealed, encoded PowerShell command when the 'tahg' directory does not exist, likely for malicious purposes. It also defines a package 'hackedpost' with suspicious metadata.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'tahg' existence; reads environment via os.path.exists; executes subprocess.Popen with encoded command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes encoded PowerShell command silently, potentially leading to remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "os.path.exists('tahg') check triggers subprocess.Popen with encoded command; if condition met, payload runs without user awareness.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed silently; broad exception handling masks errors; package name 'hackedpost' and author 'EsqueleSquad' are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally runs an obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, with no error reporting. The package setup appears standard but is likely a cover for malicious activity. The high obfuscation and silent execution are typical of malicious payloads designed to evade detection. The broad exception handling further conceals errors that could reveal malicious intent. The package's naming and author are suspicious, reinforcing malicious suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution conditioned on a file check, combined with suspicious package metadata. The high obfuscation and execution behavior justify a malware score of 0.85, a obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9.",
