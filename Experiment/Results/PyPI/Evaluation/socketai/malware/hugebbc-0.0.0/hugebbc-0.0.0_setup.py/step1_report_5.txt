  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'hugebbc'.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed, and potentially external network calls may occur during installation if dependencies execute code during installation.",
  "flows": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' are fetched and installed, which could execute code if dependencies have post-install scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define a package, with dependencies specified explicitly. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. None of these packages, by themselves, suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any network calls, data processing, or other actions beyond package setup. No suspicious patterns such as hidden code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets are present. The 'author' and 'author_email' fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\nGiven that this is a standard setup script with legitimate package dependencies, there is no indication of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks based solely on this code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The package dependencies are common and do not suggest malicious behavior. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
