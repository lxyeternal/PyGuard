{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'hugebbc' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, author, email, dependencies) and imports from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The dependencies listed may be downloaded and executed, but the code itself does not perform network or data operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code; dependencies are installed via setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata, including dependencies. No code execution, data collection, or network communication occurs here. The dependencies listed ('browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests') are common libraries and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or secret leakage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies. The overall security risk is very low.",
