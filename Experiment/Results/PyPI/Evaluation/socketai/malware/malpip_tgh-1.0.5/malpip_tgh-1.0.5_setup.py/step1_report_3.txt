{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package using setuptools, with the intent to execute malicious actions during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The malicious function 'mal()' is invoked during the 'install' command; it reads the current username via 'os.getlogin()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'mal()' function sends an HTTP GET request to a remote URL containing the username, and establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at 194.233.164.169 on port 1337, potentially allowing remote control of the system.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves executing 'mal()' during the 'install' process, which retrieves the username, constructs a URL, sends a request, and then opens a reverse shell connection, providing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of the 'mal()' function that performs network connections, reverse shell, and data exfiltration, all triggered during installation, is highly unusual and suspicious. The code imports 'turtle' but does not use it, possibly as obfuscation or distraction. The 'mal()' function directly connects to an external IP address and transmits data without any validation or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, some unused ('turtle', 'string', 'Path'), likely to obfuscate intent. The critical malicious function 'mal()' collects system username, sends it to a request bin URL, and creates a reverse shell to an external IP, enabling remote command execution. The 'mal()' function is invoked during the installation process via the 'AfterInstall' class, which hooks into setuptools' setup process. The use of network connections and reverse shell indicates malicious intent and potential for remote compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious code designed to exfiltrate user information and establish a reverse shell upon installation. The code's structure and behavior clearly indicate malicious intent, posing significant security risks. It should not be used or trusted.",
