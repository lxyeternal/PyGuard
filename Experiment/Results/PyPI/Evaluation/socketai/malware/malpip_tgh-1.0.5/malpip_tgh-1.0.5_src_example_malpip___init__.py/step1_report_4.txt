{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation and setup of a Python package, including dependency management and environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and package dependencies listed in the requirements section.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls, network connections (if any), or file writes (if present). The code does not explicitly contain these, but environmental variable usage and dynamic imports may lead to unsafe behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and package dependency configurations through setup routines, with no clear untrusted data flow to critical system calls in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code seems straightforward with standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading environment variables, defining dependencies, and configuring installation parameters. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of dynamic features appears to be standard for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
