{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python package dependency, likely used for data processing or utility functions, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard library imports, data input functions, configuration files",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess executions",
  "flows": "Input data from environment or user input → processing functions → network/file output or environment modifications",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual control flow",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, utilizing standard libraries with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The absence of dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors suggests benign behavior. The structure and patterns align with typical open-source utility modules, and no anomalies are detected that would indicate sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect a low threat level, consistent with the analysis.",
