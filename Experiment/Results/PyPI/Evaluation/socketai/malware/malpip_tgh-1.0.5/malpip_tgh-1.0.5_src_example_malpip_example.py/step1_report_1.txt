  "purpose": "The function adds one to a given number, likely intended for simple arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number', which is provided when the function is called.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result, no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows through the addition operation and is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: a function that takes a number and returns the number incremented by one. It contains no external data sources, no side effects, and no complex or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, safe, and free from malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a basic arithmetic operation with no security concerns.",
