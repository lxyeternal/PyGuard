  "purpose": "A simple function that adds one to a given number, serving as a basic utility.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' received by the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic, deterministic function performing addition. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with consistent scoring. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
