  "sinks": "Return statement output.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the return expression 'number + 1'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple arithmetic operation with no hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that takes an input 'number' and returns the value incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no network communication, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic addition operation without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a benign and straightforward implementation.",
