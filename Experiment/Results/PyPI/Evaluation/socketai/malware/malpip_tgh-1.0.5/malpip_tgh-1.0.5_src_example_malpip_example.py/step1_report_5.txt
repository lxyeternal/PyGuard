  "purpose": "Function to increment a number by one",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number'",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs the incremented value",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to addition operation, output flows from return statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple arithmetic operation with no external data or environment interaction",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that adds one to the input. It reads input only from the parameter 'number' and returns the result. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity indicates it performs a basic arithmetic operation without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward function with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs a benign increment operation.",
