{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'py-infopaypal' with specific metadata and package contents.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg'; reads environment variables and executes subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Executes a subprocess with a PowerShell command, potentially executing hidden malicious code; imports setup from distutils for package installation.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' existence -> if not present, runs a hidden PowerShell command -> proceeds to package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with a Base64-encoded string, likely malicious, and runs without user visibility. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to import modules and then checks if a file named 'tahg' exists. If not, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is hidden from view and runs asynchronously. The command's purpose appears suspicious, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads. The setup() function defines package metadata, but the malicious subprocess execution is executed prior to setup. Errors are suppressed silently, hiding any failures. The code's structure and hidden execution suggest malicious intent and a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that executes silently, indicating malicious behavior. The overall code appears designed to perform malicious actions while disguising its intent, representing a supply chain security risk.",
