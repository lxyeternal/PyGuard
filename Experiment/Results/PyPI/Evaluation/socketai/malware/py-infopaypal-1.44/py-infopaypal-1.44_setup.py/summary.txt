  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The presence of a suspicious URL and the encoding strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command confirm its purpose. The overall security risk is high."
