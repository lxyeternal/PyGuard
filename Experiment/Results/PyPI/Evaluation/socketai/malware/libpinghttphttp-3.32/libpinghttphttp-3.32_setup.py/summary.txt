  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of malicious behavior primarily through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command conditioned on a filesystem check. The obfuscation, silent error handling, and suspicious URL comment strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, with high confidence, until further payload analysis confirms its maliciousness."
