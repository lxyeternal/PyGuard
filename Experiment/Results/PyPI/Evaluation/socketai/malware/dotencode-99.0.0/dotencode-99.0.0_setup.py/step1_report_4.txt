{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information during package installation and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially leaking user system info.",
  "flows": "Data collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() flows into the requests.get call, which transmits the data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs system info collection during installation and exfiltrates this data without user consent or obvious notification. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the external request to an obscure URL is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and requests, then defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers system info: hostname, current directory, and username, and then sends this info via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration during package installation. The URL is obscure and not documented, which is suspicious. No other malicious actions such as code execution, privilege escalation, or file manipulation are present. Overall, the code behaves in a way that could compromise user privacy by silently transmitting system info.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains potentially malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user awareness. This indicates a security risk and malicious intent, likely aimed at user tracking or privacy invasion.",
