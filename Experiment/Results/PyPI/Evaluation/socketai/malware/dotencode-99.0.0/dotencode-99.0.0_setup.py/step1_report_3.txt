  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for the 'dotencode' Python package with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() to gather system information; requests.get() to send data.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits system information to an external URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, current directory, username) flows from source functions to the external URL via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a custom install class to exfiltrate system information silently during package installation; sending data to a suspicious external domain.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and third-party requests library. It defines a custom install command that, upon execution, collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user consent or awareness, which is suspicious. The external URL is obscure and likely malicious or at least privacy-invasive. No other malicious code, such as data theft, backdoors, or system modifications, is present. The code is simple, but the exfiltration behavior is malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: it secretly transmits user system information during installation to an external server. This indicates a clear security threat and privacy violation. The code is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
