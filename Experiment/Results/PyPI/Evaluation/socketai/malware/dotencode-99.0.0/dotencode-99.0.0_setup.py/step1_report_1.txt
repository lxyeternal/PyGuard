  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits data to a remote URL",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are collected during install run and sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Code actively transmits environment and user information to an external URL without user consent; use of requests within a setup script is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setuptools install command to include an extra step. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data collection without user knowledge. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data exfiltration, but the intent to send system info externally during package installation is suspicious and potentially malicious from a supply chain perspective.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during package installation without user consent. This behavior indicates a privacy violation and potential security risk, as it could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The package should be considered suspicious and potentially malicious.",
