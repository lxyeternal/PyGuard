{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the setup process to collect system information (hostname, current directory, username) during installation and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, likely for covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode)",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with these parameters",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data collection and exfiltration during package installation without user consent, external suspicious URL, no notification or opt-out",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during execution, gathers system info and sends it to an external server via a GET request. This behavior is covert, privacy-invasive, and resembles data exfiltration. No malicious payloads or code execution are present, but the activity indicates malicious intent due to privacy violation. The behavior occurs silently during installation, which is suspicious. The URL is obscure, supporting malicious suspicion. The code is straightforward and un-obfuscated. The data exfiltration is active and occurs automatically, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating user system information during package installation without consent. This constitutes a serious privacy violation and potential security risk. The activity aligns with malicious supply chain behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
