  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a specified remote URL.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (requests.get with URL 'https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/dotencode').",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into an HTTP request which transmits it to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting system info during installation and exfiltrating it without user consent or disclosure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information to an external URL via a GET request. This behavior is hidden within the setup process and can be considered suspicious, as it exfiltrates user environment data during package installation. No other malicious code, such as executing arbitrary commands or compromising system files, is present. The URL used for data exfiltration is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes covert data exfiltration during installation, which is malicious and violates user privacy. The code's purpose appears to be to secretly collect and send user system info without explicit consent. This constitutes malicious behavior with a high security risk.",
