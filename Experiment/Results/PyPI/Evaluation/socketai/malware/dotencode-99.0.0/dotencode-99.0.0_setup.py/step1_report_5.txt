{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation process that sends system information to a specified URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the run method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected system information to an external URL, which could potentially be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the source variables (hostname, cwd, username) into the requests.get call as URL parameters, resulting in data being sent over the network to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation without any user consent or transparency. The URL used is suspicious, as it is a non-standard domain, and the request is executed automatically upon package installation without safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup for a Python package named 'dotencode'. It imports necessary modules and subclasses the install command to extend its run method. During installation, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without explicit user approval, raising privacy concerns. The URL appears suspicious and could be used for tracking or data collection without the user's knowledge. The code does not include any obfuscation or encryption; it directly sends the data. No other malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a privacy-intrusive data collection and transmission during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used for unauthorized tracking or data exfiltration without user consent.",
