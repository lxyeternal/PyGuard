{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'tpguiintel' that installs the 'modlib' package and provides metadata about the package. Additionally, it includes obfuscated code that executes a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (checking for the existence of 'tahg'), and executes a subprocess command that runs PowerShell with encoded commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with a Base64-encoded string, which could be malicious or obfuscated activity.",
  "flows": "If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, the code triggers the PowerShell command; this is a source-to-sink flow where filesystem state influences execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess, no clear purpose for this command, and it runs unconditionally based on directory existence. The encoded command is suspicious and likely malicious or at least obfuscated to hide its intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard setup configuration for a Python package, which is normal. However, it then attempts to run a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command if the directory 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command suggests obfuscation, commonly used to hide malicious activity such as data exfiltration, remote access, or other unauthorized actions. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, making it harder to detect issues. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity within a seemingly benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup procedures with malicious obfuscated PowerShell code that executes without clear authorization or purpose. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The code should not be used due to the hidden malicious payload.",
