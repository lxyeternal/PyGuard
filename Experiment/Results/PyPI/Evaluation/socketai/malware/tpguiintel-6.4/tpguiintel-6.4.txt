      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The activity aligns with common tactics used in malware distribution or backdoor access. The package should be flagged and further analyzed by decoding the PowerShell payload. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed."
