  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; host and port parameters in open_connection and create_connection; user credentials in URL; socket connection methods.",
  "sinks": "Socket connect method; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection calls that establish network connections.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy type, host, port, credentials -> create_socket_wrapper creates proxy socket -> connect() establishes connection -> asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection use socket to establish final connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. Exception handling in parse_proxy_url could catch ValueError instead of TypeError for port parsing, but this is minor.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It validates inputs, handles errors gracefully, and uses external libraries appropriately. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. Minor improvements could be made in exception handling, but overall, the code is legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connection management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
