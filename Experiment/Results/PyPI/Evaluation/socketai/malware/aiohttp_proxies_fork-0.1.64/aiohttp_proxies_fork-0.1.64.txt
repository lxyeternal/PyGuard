It decodes and executes an obfuscated payload, installs dependencies silently, and contains functions indicative of backdoors or remote control. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed. Usage should be strongly discouraged."

The low security risk score is appropriate given the handling of user-controlled proxy parameters. External socket wrapper's trustworthiness should be verified separately, but within this context, the code appears safe."
