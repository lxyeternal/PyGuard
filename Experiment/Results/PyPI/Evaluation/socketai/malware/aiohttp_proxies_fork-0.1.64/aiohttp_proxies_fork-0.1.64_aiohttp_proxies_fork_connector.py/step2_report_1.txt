  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a custom proxy connector for aiohttp supporting multiple proxy types.\n- Uses parameters for proxy configuration, including optional DNS resolution bypass.\n- Constructs proxy URLs dynamically, creates socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies, and manages connection flow.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard, legitimate proxy handling implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic aligns with typical proxy connector implementations.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** No significant risks identified; the code handles user input for proxy configuration securely.\n\n### Flaws or concerns:\n- The use of `create_socket_wrapper` could be scrutinized if it internally performs malicious actions, but based on context, it appears to be a standard socket wrapper function, not inherently malicious.\n- Proxy URL construction from user parameters could be exploited if parameters are maliciously crafted, but this is typical for proxy configurations, and no injection or code execution is evident.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** The reports assign 0.2, reflecting minimal concern about user-controlled parameters influencing proxy URL formation and socket creation, which is reasonable.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies:\n- The reports are very conservative, assigning low security risk and malware scores, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the code's straightforward proxy handling, no malware or malicious activity is present. **Score: 0**.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nNo obfuscation is detected. **Score: 0**.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nWhile user-controlled parameters could pose a risk if misused, the code itself does not exhibit vulnerabilities or malicious intent. A low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, but perhaps slightly conservative. I would suggest **0.1** for a more precise reflection, but 0.2 remains acceptable.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments**. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | My estimate | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**      | No malicious activity or code patterns detected.            |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**      | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**    | Slight potential if user input is malicious, but overall low risk. |\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector, with no malicious or suspicious features. The low scores across malware and obfuscation are justified, and the security risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe from a security perspective based on the provided analysis.",
