  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate given the handling of user-controlled proxy parameters. External socket wrapper's trustworthiness should be verified separately, but within this context, the code appears safe."
