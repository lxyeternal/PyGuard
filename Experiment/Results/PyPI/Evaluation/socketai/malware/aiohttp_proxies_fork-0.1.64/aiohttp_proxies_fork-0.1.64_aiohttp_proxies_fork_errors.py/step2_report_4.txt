  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of input handling, data processing, or executable logic. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code contains only class declarations, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely class definitions with no executable or data-processing logic, there is no basis for a higher risk score. The risk is effectively zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all indicate no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (correct, no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The high confidence and zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate.\n\n**In conclusion, the report's assessments are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.**",
