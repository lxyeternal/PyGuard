  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists exclusively of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.\n- All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, and there are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code is straightforward, declarative, and appears to be boilerplate for error handling in a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code; it is purely class declarations.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Code structure:** Standard, non-suspicious exception class hierarchy.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; the code is benign.\n\n### Review of each report:\n- All reports agree that the code is just class definitions with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- They consistently assign a **malware score of 0** and **security risk of 0**.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- Since the code is only class definitions, there are no logical flaws, no data flows, and no vulnerabilities.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; there's no reason to increase the malware or risk scores.\n- The purpose of these classes is clearly error handling, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Given the code's simplicity and the reports' agreement, I concur with the provided scores.**\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations.",
