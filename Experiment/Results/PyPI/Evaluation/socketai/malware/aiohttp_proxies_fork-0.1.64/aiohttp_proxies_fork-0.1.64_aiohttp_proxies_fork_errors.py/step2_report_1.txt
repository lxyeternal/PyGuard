  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues. All classes inherit from standard exceptions, and there is no active code, data processing, or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, standard exception class declarations with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code does not contain any malicious payload, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward class declarations with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the absence of active or exploitable code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriately reflect the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, I agree with the assessments that:\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**However, considering the context of supply chain security, even benign exception definitions can sometimes be exploited if misused.**  \nBut in this case, there is no evidence of misuse or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (a minimal, almost negligible risk due to potential misuse, but not actual risk in the code itself)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is. The minimal risk score I suggest is 0.1, reflecting the very slight potential for misuse if integrated into a larger, malicious context, but this is not inherent in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the broader context in supply chain security, but based solely on this code snippet, it is safe and non-malicious.",
