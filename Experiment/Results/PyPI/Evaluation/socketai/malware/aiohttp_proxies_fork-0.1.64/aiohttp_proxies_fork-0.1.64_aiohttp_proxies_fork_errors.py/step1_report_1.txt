{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions present; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class declarations with no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard exception types. These classes are designed for handling specific SOCKS proxy and authentication error scenarios. There is no input processing, data handling, or other active code behavior. The structure is straightforward and standard for custom exception definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is purely declarative and does not execute any operations or contain external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception class definitions used for SOCKS proxy error handling. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger SOCKS proxy client or server implementation.",
