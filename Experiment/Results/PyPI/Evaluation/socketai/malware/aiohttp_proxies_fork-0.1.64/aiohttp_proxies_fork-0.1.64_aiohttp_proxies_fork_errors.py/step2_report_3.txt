  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as only defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation, no signs of malicious code.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as part of a larger system.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the original provided code.\n   - No issues, errors, or flaws are present in the class definitions.\n   - The exception classes are standard and straightforward.\n\n2. **Logic, reasoning, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The inheritance hierarchy is appropriate.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No reason exists for any scores above 0.5, given the benign nature.\n   - All reports agree on zero risk, malware, and obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly state that there are no active behaviors, input handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity, I concur with the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
