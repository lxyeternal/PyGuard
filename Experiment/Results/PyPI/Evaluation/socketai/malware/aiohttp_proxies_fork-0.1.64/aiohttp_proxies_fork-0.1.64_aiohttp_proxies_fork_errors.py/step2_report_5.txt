  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic—only class declarations.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, purely declarative, and standard for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 across all reports is justified, as the analysis is straightforward and well-supported.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no active or malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - The malware score should also be 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly 0, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they consistently state that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is present.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
