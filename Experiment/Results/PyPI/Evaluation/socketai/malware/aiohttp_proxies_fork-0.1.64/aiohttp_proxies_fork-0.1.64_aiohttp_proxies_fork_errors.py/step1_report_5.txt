{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; only class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, I/O, or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; simply class hierarchy definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only the definition of custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The class hierarchy appears standard for handling SOCKS-related errors. No potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
