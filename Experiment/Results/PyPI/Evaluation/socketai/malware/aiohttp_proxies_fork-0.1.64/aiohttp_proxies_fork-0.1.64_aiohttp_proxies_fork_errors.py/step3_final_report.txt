  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class declarations with inheritance from standard exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no active functions, data processing, or external communications. The classes inherit from standard exceptions, indicating standard error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, declarative, and typical for error management in network-related modules. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The code's structure and content do not suggest any malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and non-malicious nature.",
