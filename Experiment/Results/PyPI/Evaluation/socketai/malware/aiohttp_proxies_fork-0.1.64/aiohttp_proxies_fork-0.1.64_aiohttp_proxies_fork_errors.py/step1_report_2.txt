  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions do not read data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; just class definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution logic involving input or output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. These classes are intended for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations and connection issues. There are no functions, data processing, or logic that could be exploited. No hardcoded secrets, input reading, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes without any operational or malicious code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
