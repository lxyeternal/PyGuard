  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted data or external systems; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no executable logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code execution, dynamic code, or hidden behavior. Only exception class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, no suspicious behavior, no code injection, and no dynamic execution. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, indicating structured error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions used for handling specific network or proxy-related errors. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is clear and benign.",
