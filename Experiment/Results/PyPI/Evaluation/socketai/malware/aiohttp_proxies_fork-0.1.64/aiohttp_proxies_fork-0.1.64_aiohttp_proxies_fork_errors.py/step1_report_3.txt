  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations occur in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed. Exception class hierarchy is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes, used for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. It appears as typical boilerplate for error management within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely part of a larger, secure application handling SOCKS proxy errors.",
