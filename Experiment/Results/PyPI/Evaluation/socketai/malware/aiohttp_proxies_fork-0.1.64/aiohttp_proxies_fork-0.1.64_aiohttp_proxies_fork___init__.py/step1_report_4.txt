{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that sets up and exports components related to proxy connections, including connectors, error classes, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources are evident; the code mainly performs imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to assemble module exports; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports specific classes and functions from local modules. It does not process any external input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems beyond importing. All imported modules and components are presumed to be part of a proxy or network connection library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or data exfiltration activities. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, intended for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy-related Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is simply organizing and exporting components for use elsewhere.",
