  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content and logic confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this code is primarily about module setup: importing internal components and defining exports (`__all__`) and version (`__version__`).\n   - No data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is consistent with a typical `__init__.py` or package setup module for a proxy library.\n\n2. **Presence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior:**\n   - None of the reports detect any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations.\n   - All components seem to be standard classes and functions related to proxy handling, error management, and helpers.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or logical mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n   - The reports do not identify any logical flaws or security issues.\n\n4. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely about module setup with no processing of untrusted data or network activity, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The reports' zero scores for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential assumptions or claims:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, given the limited code context.\n   - They acknowledge the code's benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; all reports agree on zero malware and security risk.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization for a proxy library.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security flaws are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Based on this code snippet, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n- The confidence level remains at 1, as all evidence points to benign, standard code.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.**",
