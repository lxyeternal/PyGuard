  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a Python module that imports several classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string (__version__ = \"0.1.2\") and an __all__ list for public API exposure.\n- The code is purely structural, setting up module exports without any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None detected.\n- **Security flaws:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** None. The code is clear and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module setup.\n\n### Review of the Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Analysis of the Reports:\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements. They correctly identify that the code only manages imports and exports, with no data flow or external input handling.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No inconsistencies or unreasonable score assignments are apparent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is a typical module setup for a Python package, it does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations within this fragment.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious or security concerns detected. The reports are consistent and appropriate in their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
