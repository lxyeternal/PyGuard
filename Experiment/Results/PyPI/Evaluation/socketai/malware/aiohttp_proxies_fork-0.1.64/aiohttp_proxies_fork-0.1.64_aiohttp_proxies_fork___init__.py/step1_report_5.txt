{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and expose classes, error types, and helper functions related to proxy connections, likely for use in network communication through a proxy server.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this module primarily imports and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code consists of straightforward imports, module versioning, and defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from relative modules, assigns a version string, and specifies exports via __all__. It serves as a module interface or entry point for a larger package, likely related to proxy handling. There are no signs of data processing, input handling, or malicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or main module setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a network proxy package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code's purpose is to expose certain classes and functions for external use, with no evident malicious intent or security concerns.",
