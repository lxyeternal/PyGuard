  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports internal components (`.connector`, `.errors`, `.helpers`, `.proto`) and defines `__version__` and `__all__` for module API exposure.\n- It contains no data processing, network activity, user input handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n- The code appears to be part of a proxy library, likely for SOCKS proxies, and functions as an interface or setup module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n  **Yes, the reports are consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a typical module setup with no malicious intent.  \n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or summary.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign `0`, which is reasonable.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, these scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely import/export setup with no processing of untrusted data or network activity.\n- No dynamic or reflective code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- The version string is standard, no obfuscation.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the entire package is benign based on this fragment. While this fragment alone is safe, a full security assessment would consider the entire package, but based on this snippet alone, the conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. No changes needed.",
