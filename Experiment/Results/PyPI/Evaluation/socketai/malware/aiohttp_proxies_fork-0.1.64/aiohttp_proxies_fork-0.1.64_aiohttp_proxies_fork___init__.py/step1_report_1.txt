{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and imports related classes and functions for a proxy connector library, likely for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs are present; primarily module definitions and imports",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module setup with imports and exports, defining version and __all__ for module API. No input sources, no data processing, and no potential injection points are visible. The code appears to be part of a larger library for SOCKS proxy handling, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy library with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious actions.",
