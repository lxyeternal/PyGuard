  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module attribute definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module setup with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard setup code with no malicious intent. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements detected. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
