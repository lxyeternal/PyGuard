  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), sets a version string, and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It appears to be part of a proxy handling library, likely for SOCKS proxies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \nAll reports conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or security issues. This aligns with the code snippet, which is purely import/export setup without any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \nThe reports consistently identify the code as standard, benign, and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup. They correctly note the absence of suspicious patterns, data flows, or external inputs.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \nAll reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nNo report assigns a high risk score, which is correct. The code is not executing untrusted data, handling user input, or interacting with external systems.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \nAll reports assign malware score 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \nNo claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and justified.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \nScores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is purely import/export declarations, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as a standard module setup.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the assessments provided. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- If there were any hidden or malicious code embedded elsewhere, it would not be visible in this fragment.  \n- The reports correctly identify the nature of this code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns.",
