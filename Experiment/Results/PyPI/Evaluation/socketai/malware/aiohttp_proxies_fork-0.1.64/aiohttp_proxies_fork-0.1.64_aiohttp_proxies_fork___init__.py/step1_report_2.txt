  "purpose": "Defines module exports and imports necessary components for a proxy-related package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code primarily imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as this code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, establishing module exports and importing internal components. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No user input, environment variables, or network activity present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard part of a Python package related to proxy handling. It contains only import and export statements with no malicious or suspicious code. No security risks identified based on this code snippet.",
