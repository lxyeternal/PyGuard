{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes and functions to handle proxy connections and errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules, classes, and functions from the same package, likely used internally or externally by other modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input; no code executes user input or data, nor network communication or data storage within this fragment.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly present; the code defines imports and exports for other parts of the package, but no data flow or input/output operations are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code is straightforward, defining imports and module version.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and exports (__all__). It specifies a package version and publicly available symbols. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. All elements are standard for a Python package setup and do not exhibit malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard part of a proxy handling library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply manages package exports and imports, and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
