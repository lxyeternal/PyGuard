{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads from socket during _receive, sock_recv, sock_sendall, and getaddrinfo calls; also reads input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user_id.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket connection establishment, sending proxy negotiation data, and receiving responses; potential to leak data if misused, but no direct data exfiltration or network communication beyond proxy setup is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into connection and negotiation functions; socket data is sent and received during proxy negotiation; data flows from inputs to network, and responses are processed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors; code structure appears standard for proxy handling; no obfuscated code or hidden logic; error handling is explicit and typical for socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy client functionality with proper error handling, asynchronous socket operations, and address resolution. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The functions handle typical proxy negotiation and connection tasks securely. The use of exceptions for error reporting and the modular design adhere to expected patterns, with no unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flow. It performs expected proxy connection tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
