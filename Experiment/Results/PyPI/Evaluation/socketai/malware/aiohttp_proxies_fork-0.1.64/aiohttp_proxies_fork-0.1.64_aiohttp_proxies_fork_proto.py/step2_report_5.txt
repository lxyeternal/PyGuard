  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/5 proxy implementation with no malicious behaviors. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate proxy client. No obfuscation, no suspicious data flows, no backdoors. The low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the functionality.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, aligns with the clear code.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1; standard implementation, no malicious activity, high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious features, high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The code handles address resolution, proxy negotiation, authentication, and error handling properly. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no suspicious activity, high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical SOCKS proxy client, no malicious activity, high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of data exfiltration, covert channels, or malicious payloads.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches the descriptions in all reports; it is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code’s nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code’s functionality—proxy handling inherently carries some security considerations, but nothing malicious.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, typical for proxy client code.\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports are consistent, and their scoring accurately reflects the code’s behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Aspect                | Score / Justification                                               |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware               | 0 — no malicious activity detected                                   |\n| Obfuscated            | 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation                                    |\n| Security Risk         | 0.1 — standard proxy code, minimal inherent risk                     |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed review or further analysis.",
