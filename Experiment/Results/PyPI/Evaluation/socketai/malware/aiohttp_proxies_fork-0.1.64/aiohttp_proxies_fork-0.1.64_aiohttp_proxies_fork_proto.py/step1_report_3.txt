{
  "purpose": "The code provides an asynchronous proxy socket wrapper implementation supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for connecting through proxies.",
  "sources": "User-provided proxy server host and port, destination host and port, optional username and password, hostname resolution.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, data transmitted over sockets, potentially untrusted address resolution.",
  "flows": "Input host/port and credentials -> resolve address if needed -> connect to proxy server -> perform SOCKS handshake and authentication -> establish connection to target address.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; the code appears standard for SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is an implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers using asyncio. It includes functions to resolve addresses, perform proxy negotiation, handle authentication, and manage socket connections. No suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network data leaks is evident. The code only manages proxy connection procedures without any data theft or covert channels. All address resolutions are explicit and intended for legitimate proxy connections. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are detected. Error handling is appropriate, raising specific exceptions on failures. The code structure and logic follow typical patterns for proxy socket handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio, with no malicious or suspicious features. It handles network connections and proxy negotiations securely and transparently, with no evidence of malware or covert malicious activity.",
