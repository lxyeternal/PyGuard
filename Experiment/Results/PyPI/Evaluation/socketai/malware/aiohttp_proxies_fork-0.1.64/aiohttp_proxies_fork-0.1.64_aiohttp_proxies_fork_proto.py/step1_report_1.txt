{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, handling connection negotiations and authentication with proxy servers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, username/password credentials, and data from the network (socket recv/send). Specifically, hostnames, port numbers, user credentials, and data received from socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send/recv functions, especially where untrusted data is written to the network or used in address resolution. Key points include _send, _receive, sock_connect, and socket operations involving hostnames and user credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as hostnames, ports, and credentials through address resolution, socket connection, and negotiation processes, eventually leading to network transmission or reception of proxy negotiation data. For example, hostname or IP address input flows into _resolve_addr or socket.inet_pton, then through _send and _receive functions during SOCKS negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for SOCKS proxy implementations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The use of socket and asyncio libraries for network communication is typical. No obfuscated code or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, malicious domain connections, or stealth operations are present. Error handling is standard for network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies for async network operations. It includes address resolution, socket connection, authentication, and proxy negotiation. It handles common error cases and provides methods for connecting through proxies securely. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are evident. Usage of the code appears aligned with typical proxy client implementations, with proper exception handling and clean abstraction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based network communication. It does not exhibit malicious behaviors or security risks beyond normal proxy connection handling. The design is consistent with typical proxy client modules and contains no suspicious or malicious features.",
