{
  "purpose": "The code implements asyncio-based SOCKS proxy socket wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for network connections, including negotiation, authentication, and connection establishment.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets via sock_recv, sock_connect, and getaddrinfo; input parameters include hostnames, ports, and credentials (username, password, user_id).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from network responses (res, error codes, address data), which may influence control flow, exception raising, or data handling; also, socket operations are the main sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and socket connection, with network responses (errors, address info) processed to control connection and authentication flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present; no obfuscated code or malicious side-effects detected. The code performs standard proxy connection procedures. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asyncio-based SOCKS proxy client implementation, handling network connections, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and error handling. The use of standard socket operations and protocol implementations appears legitimate. No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any network communications outside of expected proxy behaviors. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present. Exception handling appropriately manages errors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, functional SOCKS proxy client implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based network connections. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or sabotage, and no security risks are evident based on the provided code. The implementation aligns with standard proxy client patterns and includes proper error handling.",
