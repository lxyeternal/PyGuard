  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's behavior.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asyncio.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code performs typical address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- The error handling and flow control are appropriate and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, the code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation with no obvious bugs or security flaws.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  No, the code follows standard patterns and best practices for proxy client implementations.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious features.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the functionality.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports mention that the code handles address resolution, authentication, and socket connection properly.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors are evident.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- The use of socket and asyncio libraries is typical and transparent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- **Not applicable here.**  \n  All scores are well below 0.5, reflecting low security risk.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- Since no malicious activity is detected, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard proxy client code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a typical, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious features or security issues evident from the provided source.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n- The risk and malware scores are correctly low.\n- No changes are necessary based on the current analysis.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed review or specific focus on any part.",
