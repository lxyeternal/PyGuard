{
  "purpose": "This code implements a SOCKS4/5 proxy client with support for address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation, intended to route network traffic through a proxy server.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from socket connections, including server responses and user credentials during authentication.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows occur during socket communication, especially when receiving server responses and sending requests, which could potentially be exploited if the server is malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket reads (responses, address info, authentication data) to internal processing, and from the code's request construction to socket writes; responses are processed to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code follows standard proxy protocol implementations without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection setup with proper error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or hardcoded credentials. The flow of data is typical for proxy clients, with source-to-sink paths involving socket communication and protocol negotiation. Given the absence of suspicious patterns or malicious activities, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1), consistent with typical proxy client code.",
