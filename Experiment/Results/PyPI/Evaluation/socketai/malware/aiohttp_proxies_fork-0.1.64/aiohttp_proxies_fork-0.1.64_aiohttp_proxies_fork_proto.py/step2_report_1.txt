  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/5 proxy implementation with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, handling proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection.\n- No suspicious or malicious activities are evident.\n- The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the benign nature.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The confidence is high; the analysis is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scoring and reasoning are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis confirms standard implementation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy client, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is typical for SOCKS proxies.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- The very low risk score is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scoring aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy implementation, standard procedures.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Proper error handling and standard design.\n- The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The implementation appears standard.\n- No suspicious or malicious features.\n- The risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scores and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** All reports describe standard SOCKS proxy implementations with no anomalies or malicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the descriptions or code summaries.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the benign analysis. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard proxy code with minimal inherent risk.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0 across all reports, justified by the lack of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High (0.9-0.95), consistent with thorough, standard proxy code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal inherent risk; proxy code can be misused if misconfigured, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
