{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for establishing network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads include network address resolution (`_resolve_addr`), socket operations (`sock_sendall`, `sock_recv`, `sock_connect`), and user-supplied hostnames and credentials (`_dest_host`, `_dest_port`, `self._username`, `self._password`).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points are socket send/receive functions and use of user credentials in SOCKS5 authentication. Address resolution may leak hostname data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (hostnames, user credentials) flows into socket requests and proxy negotiation, which are then transmitted over network sockets. Credentials flow during SOCKS5 auth, and hostnames are resolved either locally or remotely.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network behavior or backdoors identified. Proxy protocol implementations are standard. No hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, supporting connection establishment, authentication, and address resolution. It includes standard error handling, asynchronous socket communication, and support for remote hostname resolution. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. All user inputs and hostnames are used in network operations without evident malicious intent. The code adheres to standard proxy protocol implementations and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user credentials and network addresses appropriately, with proper error handling and protocol adherence. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
