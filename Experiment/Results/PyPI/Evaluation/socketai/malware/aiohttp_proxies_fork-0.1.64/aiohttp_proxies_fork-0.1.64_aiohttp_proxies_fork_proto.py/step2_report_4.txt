  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes standard proxy connection flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with a legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical SOCKS proxy client with no malicious indicators. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable, given that proxy code inherently carries some network security considerations but is not malicious by itself.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar accurate description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate proxy client.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly details standard SOCKS connection flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring. The low risk reflects typical proxy code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes typical data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy client.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical proxy client.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content. No malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), reflecting that this is proxy connection code, which by itself is not risky unless misused.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard proxy code has some inherent network security considerations but is not dangerous per se.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and justified. The scores are reasonable, and no suspicious or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Justification |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0 — no malware detected. The code is a standard proxy client. |\n| Obfuscated   | 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation. |\n| Risk         | 0.2 — typical network proxy code, minimal security risk. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
