  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It decodes and executes an obfuscated payload, installs dependencies silently, and contains functions indicative of backdoors or remote control. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed. Usage should be strongly discouraged."
