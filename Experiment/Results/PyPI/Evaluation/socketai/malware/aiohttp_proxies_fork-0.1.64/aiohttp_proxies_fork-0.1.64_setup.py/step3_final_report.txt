{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded Python script, writes it to a temporary directory, and executes it via subprocess. It installs multiple dependencies silently, likely to ensure required packages are present for malicious activities. The embedded script appears obfuscated and contains functions for network communication, token handling, and remote control, indicating malicious intent such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system sabotage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USERPROFILE), sys.argv, embedded base64 payload, external URLs (implied in decoded script), package installation commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded script via Popen, silent package installations, file writes in temp directories, network communication (implied in payload), dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line arguments influence control flow; the code decodes and writes a payload script, which is then executed, potentially establishing network connections or backdoors.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of base64 encoding, dynamic runtime decoding and execution, silent installation of multiple packages, writing files in temp directories, obfuscated payloads, use of shell=True in subprocess.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup, silently installs dependencies, decodes a large base64 payload, writes it as a Python script, and executes it. The payload, when decoded, contains functions for network communication, token management, and remote command execution. The obfuscation level and dynamic code execution are classic malware indicators. The use of environment variables and command-line arguments to control execution flow, combined with silent dependency installation, further supports malicious intent. No benign functionality is evident; all actions are aligned with covert operations, system compromise, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It decodes and executes an obfuscated payload, installs dependencies silently, and contains functions indicative of backdoors or remote control. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed. Usage should be strongly discouraged.",
