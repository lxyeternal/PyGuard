  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code appears to be part of a malicious supply chain, intended to download, execute, and potentially control or infect systems via hidden scripts and encoded payloads.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Reads environment variables (USERPROFILE), command-line arguments (sys.argv), and file contents (e.g., \"__init__.py\", embedded base64 payload).\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Executes downloaded scripts, installs packages via pip, runs subprocesses with shell=True, writes to files in temporary directories, and executes embedded payloads.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Environment variables and command-line args influence download and execution of scripts; payloads decoded from base64 are written and executed; package installations and script executions form source-to-sink paths.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Use of environment variables to define temp directories, commented-out code for writing sys.argv, obfuscated base64 payloads, dynamic script creation and execution, multiple package installations, and potentially malicious code embedded within the base64 payload. The payload is encoded and decoded at runtime, which suggests obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script begins by importing modules and reading a version from an init file. It installs several packages, including 'psutil', 'aiohttp', 'cryptography', and others, which could be used for malicious purposes like process manipulation or network activity. It then creates or writes to files in a temporary directory, decoding a large base64-encoded string into a Python script, which it executes. The payload code appears to set up network communication, possibly for remote control or data exfiltration, with references to socket operations, HTTPS requests, and command handling. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and dynamic code execution, common in malicious payloads to evade detection. The overall structure indicates an intent to silently download, decode, and execute malicious scripts, possibly establishing backdoors or remote command execution capabilities.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code demonstrates typical characteristics of malicious supply chain activity, including payload obfuscation, silent package installation, and execution of embedded scripts with potentially harmful operations. The embedded base64 payload and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at system compromise, data theft, or remote control. Given these behaviors, the package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.95\n}",
