      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell commands during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation and covert execution pose significant security risks, warranting caution and further analysis of the decoded command. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed behavior and potential threat level."
