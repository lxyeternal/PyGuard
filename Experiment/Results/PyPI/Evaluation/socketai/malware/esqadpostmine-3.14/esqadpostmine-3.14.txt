      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation, which could lead to system compromise or remote code execution. The activity is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware distribution. Scores of 0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified."
