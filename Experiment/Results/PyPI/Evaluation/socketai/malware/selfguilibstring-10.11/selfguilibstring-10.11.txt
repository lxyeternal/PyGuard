      "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior: conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading malware or establishing backdoors. The high obfuscation, silent error handling, and external URL reference justify a high security concern. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive assessment, but current evidence warrants treating the package as potentially malicious."
