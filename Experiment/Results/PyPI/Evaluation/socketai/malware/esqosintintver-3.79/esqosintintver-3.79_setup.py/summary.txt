  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload during setup, conditioned on filesystem state, with silent error handling. The suspicious URL comment and obfuscation reinforce malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect significant security risk."
