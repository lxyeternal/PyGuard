  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, which could be malicious. The silent, conditional execution and error suppression further conceal potential malicious activity. Scores should reflect high malware suspicion, obfuscation, and security risk. Decoding the command is recommended for definitive assessment."
