{
  "purpose": "The code implements asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and data transfer.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from hostnames, credentials, and network socket operations during address resolution, authentication, and data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network sockets, including proxy negotiation requests, authentication credentials, and client data streams.",
  "flows": "From input sources such as hostnames and credentials, through address resolution and authentication routines, to socket connection and data transfer functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard proxy client logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients. It performs address resolution, handles proxy negotiation, manages authentication (including username/password), and facilitates data transfer over sockets. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code handles untrusted input (hostnames, credentials) securely, with proper exception handling and socket management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to network communication and untrusted input handling, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
