{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for network connections, facilitating proxy negotiation and connection establishment.",
  "sources": "Reads include input data from hostnames, ports, and potential user credentials; data is read from socket connections during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Sends proxy negotiation requests, authentication details, and connection commands over the network; receives responses from proxies and remote servers.",
  "flows": "Input data such as hostnames, ports, and credentials flow into request construction functions; data is sent to proxy servers; responses are received and parsed for connection success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; code structure and variable usage are standard for proxy connection handling. No obfuscated code features or hidden behaviors are detected. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy negotiation using asyncio, with proper exception handling and data flow. It manages address resolution, authentication (including username/password for SOCKS5), and response parsing. No malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code appears to function solely for establishing proxy connections without harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate proxy client implementation without signs of malicious intent. It performs expected network operations for proxy negotiation, with appropriate handling of various scenarios. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected.",
