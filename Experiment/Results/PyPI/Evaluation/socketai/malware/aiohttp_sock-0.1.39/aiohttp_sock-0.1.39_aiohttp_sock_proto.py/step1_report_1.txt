{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous connection, negotiation, and data transmission through proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when resolving addresses (`getaddrinfo`), during socket communication (`sock_sendall`, `sock_recv`), and during protocol negotiation (receiving responses from proxy servers). It also reads hostname and credential data during authentication and connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include sending data to proxy servers (`_send` method), receiving data from proxy servers (`_receive` method), and socket connection functions. Sensitive information such as username, password, and hostnames are handled during authentication.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input such as hostnames, credentials, and proxy addresses are processed and sent to the proxy server during negotiation (`_send` methods). Responses from proxy servers are received and parsed to verify the connection and authentication status. Address resolution flows from input hostnames to IP addresses before being sent in connection requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or unnecessary code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Error handling appears standard for network operations. The code performs typical proxy negotiation, with no indication of data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious activity. No code segments suggest hiding or malicious data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, handling network communication asynchronously with proper exception handling. It resolves hostnames, manages authentication, and negotiates connections with SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, command injection, or secret exfiltration are detected. The structure and function are consistent with legitimate proxy handling code. The code operates as a proxy client, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers used for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It follows expected patterns for network communication and proxy negotiation without any suspicious or malicious anomalies.",
