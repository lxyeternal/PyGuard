  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It handles proxy negotiation, authentication, and data transfer as expected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical for proxy clients. The security risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable given the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard implementation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. The risk score is very low, aligning with the absence of issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with proper handling, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns well with the code. The low risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy code, no secrets or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward SOCKS proxy wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the analysis; no concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting low security risk, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with their reasoning.\n- Given the detailed analysis, no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks exists.\n- The overall risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0 for the highest confidence reports, but 0.1–0.2 is acceptable for low-risk network code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy implementation)\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the absence of any suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
