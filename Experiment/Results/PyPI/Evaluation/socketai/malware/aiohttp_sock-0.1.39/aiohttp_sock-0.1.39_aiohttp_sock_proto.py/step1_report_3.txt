{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling clients to connect to remote servers through a proxy.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the network via socket connections using sock_recv, sock_sendall, and getaddrinfo. User input could influence host, port, username, and password parameters provided to class constructors.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can be sent via sock_sendall methods, including requests and authentication data. The connect methods perform network connections and address resolutions, potentially exposing sensitive data if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, username, password) flow into socket connection and negotiation methods; network responses are read in negotiate and connect methods, with data potentially influenced by external sources. Data written to sockets can include sensitive information like credentials or DNS hostnames.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code appropriately handles network operations, address resolution, and protocol negotiation. The presence of multiple exception handling paths and the detailed error messages are standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, implementing SOCKS proxy protocols with asynchronous socket operations, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It handles errors and exceptions correctly, providing clear error messages. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms, is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate proxy client implementation, focusing on network communications without storing or transmitting untrusted data outside the expected protocol flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles network connections and protocol negotiation securely and correctly, with appropriate exception handling. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected, and the security risks are minimal.",
