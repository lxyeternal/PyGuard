{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing clients to connect through proxy servers with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from hostnames, port numbers, socket responses, and authentication credentials; resolving hostnames via DNS; receiving data from socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Sending constructed protocol requests to the proxy server; connecting to the proxy server; receiving responses and bind addresses from the proxy server.",
  "flows": "Input host and port are used to build requests; requests are sent via socket; responses from proxy are processed; connection proceeds based on proxy responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and well-known protocols. No malicious data exfiltration or suspicious network activity is evident. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features. No dynamic code execution or misleading variable use detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols with proper error handling, address resolution, and authentication procedures. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present. The network interactions are confined to standard proxy communication patterns. There is no indication of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The structure and flow are straightforward, adhering to protocol standards. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or anomalous activities.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous use, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for proxy communication without any embedded malware or security threats.",
