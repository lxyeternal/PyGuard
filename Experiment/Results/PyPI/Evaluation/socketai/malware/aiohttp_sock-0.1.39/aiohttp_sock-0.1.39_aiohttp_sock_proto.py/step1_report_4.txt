{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, supporting connection negotiation and authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include: host, port, user credentials, and input data for socket operations. Data resolution occurs via getaddrinfo. Authentication data is read from internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to socket send methods, especially during negotiate, connect, and authentication processes. Data received from socket responses are processed for connection setup.",
  "flows": "Source variables (e.g., host, port, username, password) are used in connection and authentication requests, which are sent via socket. Responses are read back and processed for validation and setup.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. Exception handling is standard. No obfuscation, no hidden network communications, no data exfiltration or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy handling with asynchronous socket operations, including connection, authentication, and address resolution. It uses standard libraries and common practices. No suspicious data handling, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code operates as expected for a proxy client, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It facilitates proxy connections with authentication support but does not exhibit any signs of malware or security risks.",
