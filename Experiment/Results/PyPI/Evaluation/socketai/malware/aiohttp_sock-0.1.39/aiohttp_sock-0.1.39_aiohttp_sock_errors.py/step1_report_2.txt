{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; exception classes do not perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no execution logic, input handling, or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of exception class definitions with inheritance, no unusual language features or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines several custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and related issues. These classes inherit from standard exception types and do not include any methods, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. The code appears purely structural, intended for error handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes without any behavior, input/output, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for error handling in network proxy contexts.",
