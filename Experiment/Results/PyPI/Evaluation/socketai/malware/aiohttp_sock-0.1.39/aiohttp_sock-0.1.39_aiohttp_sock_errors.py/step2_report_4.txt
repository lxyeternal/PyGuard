  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exception types and do not contain any methods or payloads.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, benign, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is purely structural, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, external interactions, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - **Suggestion:** No change needed; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - Given the code's nature, this is justified.\n   - **No adjustment needed.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score of 0 is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided. The code is benign and serves as a foundational error handling component in a larger system.",
