{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing paths as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; simple exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception types to represent specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxies and connections. There are no input/output operations, no data flow, no dynamic code execution, nor any obfuscated or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a larger network-related Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, non-malicious set of exception class definitions with no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as error handling scaffolding for SOCKS proxy operations, with no malicious intent detected.",
