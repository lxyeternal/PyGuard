{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors, serving as error handling mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception types; no input, data reading, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; the code does not handle or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares exception classes without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. It contains no input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The classes inherit from standard Python exception types and serve as error indicators. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code is a minimal, standard implementation for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The exception class definitions are standard and serve their purpose without any suspicious behavior. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
