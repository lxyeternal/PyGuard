  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or malicious code present.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code serves as error handling scaffolding, which is standard practice.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions solely on the code content.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions with no security risks.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
