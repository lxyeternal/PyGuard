  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines exception classes without any data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows or outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up exception class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for various custom exception types related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. No data input/output, network activity, or malicious code behavior is present. The classes inherit from standard exception types without additional logic or payloads. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger application or library to handle SOCKS proxy errors and does not pose any threat.",
