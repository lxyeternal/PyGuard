  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only defines exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are observed; the code is straightforward and standard for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions for custom exceptions, primarily inheriting from standard Python exception classes. These classes are named to reflect specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution present. The structure appears conventional, with no obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines custom exception classes used for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. The code appears to be standard and benign.",
