  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exception types and serve as error indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify that the code is straightforward, benign, and solely for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is non-malicious and safe is justified based on the provided code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code indicate no malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher risk score would be unjustified unless additional code or context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis in each report.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
