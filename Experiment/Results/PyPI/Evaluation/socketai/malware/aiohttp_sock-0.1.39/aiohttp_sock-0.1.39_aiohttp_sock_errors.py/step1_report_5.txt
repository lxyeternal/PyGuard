  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or control flow involving untrusted data exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or external communications. The class hierarchy appears to be straightforward, representing different error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines exception classes with no active logic, input handling, or external interactions. It is benign and appears to serve as part of a larger proxy implementation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
