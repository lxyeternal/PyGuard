  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no data flows, input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are identified. This strongly indicates the code is purely structural and non-malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are uniform and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, standard exception class definitions with no malicious activity, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis provided.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of class definitions.  \n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**  \n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
