  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code provided is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exception types and do not contain any methods or payloads.\n   - Based on the code alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n   - The summaries correctly state that these are benign exception class definitions serving error handling purposes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code is benign and standard for exception handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are grounded in the code analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The reports do not speculate beyond what the code shows.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is standard, non-malicious, and safe. The reports correctly identify this, and no changes to scores or conclusions are needed.",
