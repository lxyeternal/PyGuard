{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and manage network connections via SOCKS proxy servers, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with the ability to parse proxy URLs and establish connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'raw_url' parameter in 'parse_proxy_url' function, user-supplied parameters such as 'socks_url', 'host', 'port', 'proxy_type', and optional environment variables or function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network socket connections through 'sock.connect' and 'asyncio.open_connection', which can transmit data over the network, and the 'loop.create_connection' call for creating protocol-based connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or parameters (like 'socks_url', 'host', 'port') through URL parsing or direct assignment, into socket wrapper creation, which then connects to target hosts, eventually resulting in network communication via established sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The code straightforwardly creates SOCKS proxy connections and does not include hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection setup with asynchronous support. It uses well-known libraries and patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It correctly handles URL parsing, connection establishment, and proxy protocol selection. The functions raise appropriate exceptions on invalid inputs. The overall structure is clear and adheres to expected networking practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical, benign utility for establishing proxy-based network connections. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It responsibly handles inputs and network interactions without any signs of malware or security risks.",
