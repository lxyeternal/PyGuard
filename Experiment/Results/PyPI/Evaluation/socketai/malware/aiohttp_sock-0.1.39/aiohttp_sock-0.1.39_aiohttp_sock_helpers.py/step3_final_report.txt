{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse proxy URLs, create SOCKS4/5 socket wrappers, and establish asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; user-supplied host and port parameters; external socket wrapper creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Connecting to specified host and port via proxy; potentially untrusted proxy URLs leading to redirection or interception.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts credentials and host info from raw URL -> create_socket_wrapper uses proxy type and credentials -> open_connection / create_connection establish connection via socket wrapper -> data flows through proxy to target host.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Minor validation oversight if port is missing in URL (not a security flaw).",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing SOCKS4/5 proxy connections asynchronously. It parses proxy URLs, handles credentials, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and manages network connections with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious activities are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs expected operations. The potential misuse of proxy URLs is a general concern but not a flaw. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score low (~0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse via malicious URLs, not a flaw in the code itself. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
