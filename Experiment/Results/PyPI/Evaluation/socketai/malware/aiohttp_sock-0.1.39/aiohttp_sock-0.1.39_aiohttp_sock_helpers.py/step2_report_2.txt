  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing SOCKS4/5 proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and connects via asyncio.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries (aiohttp_sock, yarl), which are common for such tasks.\n- The network operations are straightforward, with proper error handling for invalid inputs.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code appears correct, with proper validation and no malicious logic.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code structure is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign **0**.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign **0**.\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign **0.2**.\n- The main concern is that malicious proxy URLs could redirect or intercept traffic, but this is inherent to proxy usage, not a flaw in the code itself.\n- The code does not introduce additional vulnerabilities.\n- **Justification for 0.2:** This is a reasonable risk score for proxy-related misuse, not a code flaw.\n\n---\n\n### Logical consistency and claims:\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, standard implementation, and lack of malicious intent.\n- No report makes unsupported assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities.\n- The consistent scores reflect this understanding.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2               | Proxy URL misuse could pose some risk, but not a code flaw. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable behaviors are detected.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at **0**.\n- Maintain security risk at **0.2**.\n- Overall, the code appears safe and well-implemented.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the report's reasoning aligns with the code analysis.",
