{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for creating network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables (via asyncio.get_event_loop()), and the raw proxy URL string.",
  "sinks": "Network connections using create_connection and open_connection, especially when connecting to specified host and port, and potentially untrusted proxy URLs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, socks_url) are parsed and processed; proxy URL is parsed to extract connection details; socket wrapper is created and connected; finally, network connection is established via asyncio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of standard libraries and practices appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters, parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers based on proxy type, and establishes network connections asynchronously. The proxy URL parsing uses unquote for user info but defaults to empty strings on errors, which is standard. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious logic detected. The code relies on standard libraries and known third-party modules (aiohttp_sock, yarl). It does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden actions. Overall, the logic appears clean, intended for network proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard patterns and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
