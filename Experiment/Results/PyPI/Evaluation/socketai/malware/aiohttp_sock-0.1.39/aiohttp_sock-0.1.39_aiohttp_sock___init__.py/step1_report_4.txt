{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a SOCKS proxy client library, providing classes, errors, and helper functions related to proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this code snippet; no data processing or external communication is directly shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is demonstrated within this snippet; the code primarily defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The version string is a typical package version identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, error class definitions, a version string, and an export list (__all__). It appears to be a module initializer or interface for a larger package, with no actual data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident. The structure and content are consistent with standard package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign part of a SOCKS proxy client library. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to define and export components for use elsewhere. Based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of supply chain security issues.",
