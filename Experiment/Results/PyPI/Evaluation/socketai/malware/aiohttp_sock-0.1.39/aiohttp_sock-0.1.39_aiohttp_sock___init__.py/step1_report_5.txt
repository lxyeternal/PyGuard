{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python library that provides SOCKS proxy connection functionality, including error handling and connection helpers.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and components related to proxy connections, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly imports and defines module exports.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows involving untrusted input or network operations are visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level imports, error classes, helper functions, and constants. It appears to be a standard module initialization file for a SOCKS proxy client library. No code executes any untrusted input, network operations, or potentially malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code. Since this is likely part of a larger package, without additional context, there are no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, containing no malicious or suspicious elements. It performs imports and defines exports without executing any untrusted operations or containing malicious patterns.",
