{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python library for handling proxy connections, including importing modules, defining exports, and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and the module's own version string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication, as the code mainly performs imports, defines constants, and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up module namespace and version info; no data flow from sources to sinks indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The version string is a common practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several local modules related to proxy handling, error definitions, helpers, and protocol types. It then defines a version string and exports a set of symbols for external use. There are no dynamic evaluations, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure and content are typical for a well-structured Python package's __init__.py or main module setup. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup or initialization script for a proxy handling library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content do not indicate obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
