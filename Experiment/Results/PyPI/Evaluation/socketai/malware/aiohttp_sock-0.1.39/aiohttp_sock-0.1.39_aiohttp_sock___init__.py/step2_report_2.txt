  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or main module, that imports various components (`ProxyConnector`, error classes, helpers, protocol types), sets a version string, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- There are no network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a SOCKS proxy client library or similar package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard module setup, with no suspicious behavior, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- They correctly identify that the code is primarily import/export and versioning setup.\n- The confidence level in all reports is 1.0, indicating they are very certain of their assessment.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is a typical module initializer with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is benign.\n\n- **Malware concerns:**  \n  The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only analyze the static code.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code snippet and the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy library.\n- No supply chain security issues are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**I concur with the existing assessments.**  \nThe code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is a straightforward module initializer.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
