  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export modules related to a proxy connection library, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy types.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and module-level attribute definitions (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks in this code; no untrusted data handling or external network actions are present",
  "flows": "The code imports components and exposes them for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and appears to be part of a standard library or package structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy handling and error management, defines versioning and exports. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical Python package modules. No obfuscation or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module defining proxy-related classes and constants, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
