{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a SOCKS proxy client library, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), reading class and function definitions, and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly defines imports and exports, with no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink within this code fragment; it only sets up references and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components related to proxy connection handling, error definitions, helpers, and protocol types. It defines a version and exports specific symbols for external use. No input/output, data processing, or network activity occurs in this fragment. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors; the structure and content are consistent with standard package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a package initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, containing only import/export definitions and versioning. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
