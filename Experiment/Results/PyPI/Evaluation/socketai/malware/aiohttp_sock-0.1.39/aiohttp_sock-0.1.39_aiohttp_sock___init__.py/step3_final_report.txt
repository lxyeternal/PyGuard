  "purpose": "Module setup and export definitions for a proxy handling library, establishing version and public API symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports and definitions are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard package initialization without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module initializer, importing internal components, defining version and export symbols. No network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. All assessments from the provided reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The structure and content are consistent with a standard, safe package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified, indicating no supply chain security concerns.",
