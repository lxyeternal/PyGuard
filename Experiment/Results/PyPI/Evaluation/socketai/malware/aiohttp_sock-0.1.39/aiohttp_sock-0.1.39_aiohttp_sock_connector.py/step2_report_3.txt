  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a proxy connector implementation supporting HTTP and other proxy types.\n- No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code relies on input parameters, URL parsing, and socket creation, all of which are standard practices.\n- The \"malware\" score assigned is 0 in all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minor concerns mainly about untrusted input handling rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or malicious code are present in the actual code snippets. The code appears legitimate and well-structured.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, backdoors, or obfuscation are identified.\n- **Scores Justification:** The assigned scores seem reasonable given the analysis—no malware, low security risk, no obfuscation.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly higher for some reports (0.2), justified by the fact that the code accepts external inputs for proxy configuration, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious—this is a common security consideration but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The main security concern is the handling of untrusted proxy URLs and parameters, which could lead to misconfiguration or indirect data leaks if malicious proxies are used. However, this is a standard risk in proxy handling, not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the need for input validation but not indicating a serious security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slight security risk is due to handling external inputs, which is typical in such configurations but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed; scores are appropriate.",
