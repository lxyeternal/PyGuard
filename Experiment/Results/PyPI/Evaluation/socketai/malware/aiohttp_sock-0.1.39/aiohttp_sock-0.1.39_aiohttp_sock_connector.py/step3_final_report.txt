  "purpose": "Implements a proxy connector for aiohttp supporting various proxy types, with URL parsing, socket creation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy configuration, proxy URL, host, port, username, password",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, proxy URL formation, request proxy update",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> proxy_url property -> socket wrapper creation -> connection setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector. It constructs proxy URLs based on input parameters, creates socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies, and manages connection setup. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The proxy URL construction is straightforward, and socket creation relies on external helper functions. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to handling untrusted proxy inputs, which is typical in proxy configurations. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is around 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard caution but no actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The existing reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
