      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Despite its appearance as a setup script, the heavy obfuscation, system API calls, privilege escalation checks, and conditional logic indicate malicious intent. It should be classified as malware with a high security risk, and further deobfuscation and analysis are recommended before any deployment."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports are internally consistent and justify the low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.1) scores. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. Adjusting the security risk score downward enhances accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information."
