{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script for processing user input and performing some basic operations, possibly for data analysis or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "User input via functions like input(), environment variables, or data read from files or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Input collection points lead to processing functions, which may then output data or perform actions on external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated segments observed. No hidden backdoors or code that performs unauthorized actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python functions. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual data handling are evident. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, does not seem malicious. The script does not connect to external servers, handle sensitive data insecurely, or perform risky operations. The overall structure suggests a benign utility script with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script without any suspicious features.",
