  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The code snippets or descriptions provided in each report, including any input points or data reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications that could result from untrusted data or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources through processing logic to output or system effects, indicating potential malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Any suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All five reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and low security risk (0.2), with high confidence (0.7-0.9). The scores are aligned with the benign assessments. Minor adjustments are recommended to better reflect the minimal risk, specifically lowering the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 across all reports, given the absence of suspicious features or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are internally consistent and justify the low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.1) scores. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. Adjusting the security risk score downward enhances accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information.",
