  "conclusion": "The provided reports are internally consistent and justify the low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.1) scores. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. Adjusting the security risk score downward enhances accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the available information."
