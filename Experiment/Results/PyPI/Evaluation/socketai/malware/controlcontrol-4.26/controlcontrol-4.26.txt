      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating potential malicious behavior. The stealth tactics and obfuscation are red flags for malware or backdoor activity. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated with caution until the payload is decoded and verified."
