  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package, with additional behavior triggered during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, downloads and executes a file from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers, writing to and executing a downloaded file, system command execution with os.system.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends data to remote server -> downloads executable from external URL -> executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to send data remotely, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, use of a broad except clause that suppresses all errors, use of system call to execute a potentially malicious file.",
  "analysis": "The code intercepts the installation process via a custom 'PostInstallCommand' class that runs 'send()'. The 'send()' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, passing this environment info. Subsequently, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. This behavior indicates attempts to exfiltrate data and execute remote code during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The broad exception handling may conceal errors, increasing risk. The code does not use any obfuscation or benign purposes. The URLs involved are not standard, further indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing a remote payload during installation, which can compromise system security. It appears intentionally designed to perform malicious activities rather than serve a benign purpose.",
