{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'flak8' with custom installation steps.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', and URLs used in requests to external servers.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded files with 'os.system', sending HTTP GET requests to external domains, and retrieving environment variables.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via an HTTP request; if on Windows, a file is downloaded and executed, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves environment data and then makes requests to external URLs, including downloading and executing a potentially untrusted file. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' are suspicious, as they are not standard repositories or known safe sources. The use of 'os.system' to run a downloaded executable is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for setup, requests, and system platform checks. The 'send' function attempts to read the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and send it to a suspicious URL. On Windows, it downloads an executable from an external, unverified source and runs it directly, which is a significant security risk. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' executes this 'send' function after installation. The URLs used are not associated with legitimate or well-known sources, indicating potential malicious intent. The code's behavior resembles a supply chain attack, exfiltrating system info and executing remote or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes suspicious network activity and executable download and execution, indicating high malicious potential. It appears designed to exfiltrate system info and run malicious code, making it dangerous for inclusion in any environment.",
