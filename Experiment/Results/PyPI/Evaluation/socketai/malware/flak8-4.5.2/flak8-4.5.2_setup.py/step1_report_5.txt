{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs installation routines, including potentially malicious network activity and file execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs fetched via requests, and the OS system call to execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs and executing downloaded executable files on the local system.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server via GET request. Additionally, an executable is downloaded and run on the local machine.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to send data to an external server, downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable, lack of error handling that could obscure malicious activity, and the overall purpose of the code is not aligned with typical package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and other modules, defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable file from a questionable domain and runs it on Windows systems. The 'PostInstallCommand' class ensures the 'send' function is called during package installation. The setup configuration defines a package named 'flak8' with no meaningful dependencies. The combined behavior suggests that during installation, the code attempts to collect system info and execute malicious payloads, which are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing a downloaded file without user consent. These actions pose security risks and indicate the package is compromised or malicious.",
