  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation step that performs additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs for downloading files and sending HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "os.system call to execute downloaded executable, HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "Read 'COMPUTERNAME' env var -> send HTTP GET request with env data -> download executable from external URL -> execute downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling with 'except: pass', downloading and executing an executable during package installation, querying environment variables and external servers without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it as a parameter in an HTTP GET request to an external domain. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it using 'os.system'. This operation occurs during the custom 'install' command execution, meaning it runs automatically upon package installation. The broad exception handling obscures errors and potential malicious activity. The combination of environment data transmission, downloading, and executing arbitrary code during installation strongly indicates malicious behavior, likely aiming to install backdoors or malware. The URLs used are suspicious and could be malicious servers hosting harmful payloads. The code's intent appears to be covert data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting environment data, sending it to external servers, and downloading and executing an executable during installation, which could compromise the user's system. The use of broad exception handling and external URLs raises significant security concerns.",
