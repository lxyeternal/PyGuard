{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom post-installation step that performs network requests and potentially malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr')",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') via os.system",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends it as part of HTTP GET request -> downloads executable from external URL -> executes downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable during package installation, dynamic URL construction based on environment variable, silent exception handling that suppresses errors",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It then makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain, possibly exfiltrating this information. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable from a dubious URL and executes it silently. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' triggers this 'send' function during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The package metadata itself appears standard, but the post-install actions are malicious in intent, involving downloading and executing an external executable without user consent or awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system info, downloads, and runs a potentially harmful executable during installation. This is a supply chain attack vector aimed at compromising systems through package installation.",
