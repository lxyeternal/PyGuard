{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system environment data, downloads a suspicious executable, and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads from external URLs for payload download.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains; execution of downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request; download executable -> os.system execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; downloading and executing untrusted external files during installation; suspicious URLs; no input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system info and exfiltrates it via HTTP. On Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it with os.system. This occurs during package installation, triggered by a custom install command. The code's behavior aligns with malicious activity, including remote payload execution and data theft. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward. The broad exception handling conceals errors, increasing risk. URLs are suspicious, and actions are highly dangerous, indicating a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior involving data exfiltration, remote code execution, and payload download. It is highly malicious and poses a severe security threat. The malware score should be set to 1, obfuscation to 0, and overall security risk to 1.",
