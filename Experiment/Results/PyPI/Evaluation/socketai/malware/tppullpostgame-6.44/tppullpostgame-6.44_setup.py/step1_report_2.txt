{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package named 'tppullpostgame', possibly with malicious intent embedded in the code executed during setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system with 'os.path.exists' and executes a subprocess with 'subprocess.Popen'. It also reads metadata from the setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command that could potentially be malicious, especially since it encodes a command string and runs it hidden. The setup() function itself does not directly involve untrusted data, but the subprocess execution is a significant concern.",
  "flows": "The code checks for a directory ('tahg') and, if absent, executes a PowerShell encoded command. The flow involves reading filesystem state and conditionally executing a potentially malicious command.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded, potentially obfuscated, and executes with hidden window style. The URL within the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') suggests malicious or suspicious activity. The overall structure with try-except blocks silently ignoring errors may hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique. The command appears to download or execute remote content ('esquelasquad.rip'), indicating potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote control, or malware download. The silent error handling prevents detection of failures. The setup() configuration is typical but may be used to disguise or embed malicious activity during package installation. The code does not directly contain malware but executes a suspicious command, which is a high-risk indicator.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an encoded PowerShell command that likely connects to a suspicious domain, suggesting remote control or malware download capabilities. The use of obfuscation and silent error handling increases concern. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe.",
