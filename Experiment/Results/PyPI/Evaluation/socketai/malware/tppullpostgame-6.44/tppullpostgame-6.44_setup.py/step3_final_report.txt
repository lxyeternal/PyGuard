  "purpose": "Detects and evaluates potentially malicious obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command; import modules.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen with encoded PowerShell command, silent error handling.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' -> executes encoded command if absent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command, suspicious URL 'esquelasquad.rip', silent exception handling, execution during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, referencing a suspicious URL. Silent exception handling conceals errors. The obfuscation and URL strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially remote code execution or data exfiltration. The setup function appears standard but may serve as a vector for malicious payloads. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.75-1, obfuscated 0.8-1, risk 0.8-0.95) are justified given the evidence. The high obfuscation and suspicious URL, combined with silent failure suppression, indicate high malicious potential. Without decoding the command, certainty is limited, but indicators strongly suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, referencing a known malicious URL. Silent error handling and encoded payloads further support malicious intent. Scores are appropriate; the package should be flagged as malicious with high security risk.",
