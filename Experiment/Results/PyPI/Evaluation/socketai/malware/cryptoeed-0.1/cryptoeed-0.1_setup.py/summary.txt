  "conclusion": "This dependency is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It employs heavy obfuscation to conceal actions that modify the system, install packages, and escalate privileges. The behaviors align with sabotage, malware delivery, or backdoor activities. It should be classified as malicious or sabotage code and avoided in any environment."
