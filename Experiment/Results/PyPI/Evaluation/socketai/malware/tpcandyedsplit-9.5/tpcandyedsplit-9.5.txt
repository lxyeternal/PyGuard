      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, with indicators of malicious intent such as stealth execution, obfuscation, and a suspicious URL comment. The package should be considered malicious, and further analysis of the encoded command is recommended. The high scores assigned are appropriate and reflect a high probability of malicious behavior."
