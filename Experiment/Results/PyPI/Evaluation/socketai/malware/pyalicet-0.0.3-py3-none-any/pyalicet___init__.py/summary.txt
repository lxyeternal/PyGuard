  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates beaconing or reconnaissance activity, which can be malicious but is also common in testing scenarios. The high malware and risk scores in some reports are overstated; a more accurate assessment would assign a malware score around 0.1-0.2 and a risk score around 0.2-0.3, reflecting low inherent danger but potential for misuse in malicious contexts."
