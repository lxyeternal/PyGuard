{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedinfo' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg', and executes a subprocess command that encodes and executes a PowerShell script.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes a PowerShell command that is encoded, which could potentially be malicious if it contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> Executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> Continues with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a PowerShell command with an encoded payload that executes without clear purpose or transparency. The code attempts to run a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, which is suspicious. The URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment is also suspicious. The setup process itself is standard, but the embedded command raises concern.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup from distutils and then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, likely to perform malicious activity or establish a backdoor. This command is executed silently without user awareness. The setup function is called within a try-except block to prevent crashes but contains no obvious malicious code. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and the hidden execution are common tactics for malicious payloads or backdoors. The rest of the code is standard package setup, but the initial code execution is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior in executing an encoded PowerShell command without explanation, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor installation. The package setup code itself appears normal, but the embedded payload poses a security risk.",
