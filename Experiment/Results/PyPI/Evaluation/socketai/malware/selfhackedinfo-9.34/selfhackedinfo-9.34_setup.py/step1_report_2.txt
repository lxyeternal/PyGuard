{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedinfo' with the package 'modlib', but also attempts to execute suspicious PowerShell commands in the background.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system (checking if 'tahg' exists), and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The PowerShell command executed could be a sink, as it involves running encoded commands which may be malicious.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' -> if not present, executes a hidden PowerShell command -> proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded, runs in hidden mode, and is executed without user consent or obvious purpose. The URL in the comment is suspicious. The code runs setup() with minimal error handling, which could hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded payload, likely obfuscated to evade detection. The command appears to connect to a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip) embedded as a comment, which raises suspicion. The code also performs a check for a file named 'tahg' but does nothing with this information aside from potentially triggering the PowerShell command if the file doesn't exist. The setup() function creates a package called 'selfhackedinfo' with a package 'modlib', which seems legitimate, but the presence of the encoded PowerShell command suggests an attempt to perform malicious actions in the background, such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The overall structure and the use of obfuscated encoded commands indicate malicious intent or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command executed in the background, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The package setup seems legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious actions. Overall, the code demonstrates a high probability of malicious intent.",
