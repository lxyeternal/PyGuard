  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer that uses unconventional sys.modules manipulation but does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the risk score should remain low (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the code is benign and primarily for namespace management."
