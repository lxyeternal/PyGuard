  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), key access methods (__getitem__, get), update methods (update), and __repr__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication functions present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization (__init__), updates, and key access (__getitem__, get) to internal storage (_store or __dict__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward data structure implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard dictionary-like classes with case-insensitive behavior (CaseInsensitiveDict) and a simple lookup dictionary (LookupDict). The methods involve standard data storage, retrieval, and iteration. There are no external calls, no data leak points, nor any suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code is consistent with typical data structure patterns and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries for internal use within the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and benign.",
