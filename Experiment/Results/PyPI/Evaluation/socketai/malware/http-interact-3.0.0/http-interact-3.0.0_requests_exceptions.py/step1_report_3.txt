  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3.exceptions and .compat.JSONDecodeError; exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard class definitions without unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for error handling in an HTTP request library. It imports standard exceptions and defines subclasses for different error scenarios, such as connection issues, timeout, URL errors, and warnings. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden functionalities, or unusual code patterns. No external data is read or written, and there are no suspicious operations or backdoors. The structure and content are consistent with standard practice for exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a request-handling library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. It appears safe and legitimate.",
