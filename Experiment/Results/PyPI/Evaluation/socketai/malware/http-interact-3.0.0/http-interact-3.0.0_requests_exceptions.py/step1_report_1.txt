  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various request errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines classes and imports, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or untrusted data to sinks; classes are used for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions and third-party exceptions. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module. The classes serve as error types for HTTP request handling, such as connection issues, JSON decoding errors, SSL errors, timeouts, and URL errors. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are consistent with standard request exception handling logic. No suspicious patterns or anomalies were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or anomalous code segments, and no security risks.",
