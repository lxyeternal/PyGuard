{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for the requests library, mainly for handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat, class constructors and attribute accesses within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; exception handling and class definitions do not involve processing untrusted data or performing I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines exception classes and their constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. All classes are standard exception definitions with clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for a HTTP request library. It imports exceptions, extends base exceptions, and defines class constructors with proper inheritance. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or I/O that could be exploited or that could leak data. It appears to be a benign, standard exception hierarchy implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class module for a requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain any malware or obfuscation.",
