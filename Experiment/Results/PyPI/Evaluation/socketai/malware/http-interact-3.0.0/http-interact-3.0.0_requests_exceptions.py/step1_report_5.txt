{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external exceptions; class constructors and attributes that may access response/request objects.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines exception classes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions and other imported exceptions, with constructors mainly initializing attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The class hierarchy and imports are consistent with typical request handling exceptions. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for error handling within the library.",
