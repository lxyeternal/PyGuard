{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests and Python version differences in the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system modules, external libraries (chardet, simplejson), and standard library functions (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data manipulation; imports are standard library modules and external dependencies.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; code mainly initializes imports and compatibility layers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is primarily for compatibility and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up environment detection (Python 2/3), attempts to import optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson), and manages compatibility for different Python versions. No data is processed or transferred; no input/output flows that could be exploited. The code appears standard for a compatibility layer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and utility module for the 'requests' library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles imports and environment detection, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
