  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, managing imports, version detection, and defining compatibility variables.",
  "sources": "Standard modules, conditional imports, version info, and fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is setup/configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility module handling import fallbacks, version detection, and defining compatibility variables. It uses common patterns such as try-except for optional dependencies and version checks. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. The logic is static and intended solely for environment compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, well-understood pattern used widely in cross-version Python code.",
