{
  "purpose": "The code handles import compatibility for Python 2 and 3, manages JSON module imports, and provides backward compatibility features for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and defines type aliases and compatibility variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables without processing or executing untrusted input; no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard compatibility code with no suspicious or unusual patterns. The import fallback for chardet and simplejson is normal, and the variable definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The module provides compatibility support across Python versions, using try-except blocks for optional imports and defining compatibility variables. There are no dynamic code execution, untrusted input processing, or suspicious patterns observed. All code appears to be for standard environment setup, with no embedded malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility and import management module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or other security issues.",
