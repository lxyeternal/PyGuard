{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and importing modules accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads from system modules like sys, import statements, and conditional imports based on availability of external libraries (chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or output generated.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities; the code primarily sets up environment compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The import logic and version checks are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and module imports with fallbacks, ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation that could be malicious. All imported modules are standard or well-known third-party libraries used for compatibility and parsing. No anomalous behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It sets up environment-dependent imports and compatibility variables, which are typical for maintaining backward compatibility.",
