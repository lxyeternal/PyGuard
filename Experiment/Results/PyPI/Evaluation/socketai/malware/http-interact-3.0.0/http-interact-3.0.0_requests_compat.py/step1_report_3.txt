{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and dependencies, mainly for HTTP requests and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and system version info.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code mainly handles imports, version checks, and defines basic compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; the code initializes modules and sets compatibility flags without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling import fallback for chardet and simplejson, defining version flags, and importing necessary standard libraries. All operations are typical for such modules and do not involve untrusted data or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, non-malicious, and intended for compatibility purposes. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
