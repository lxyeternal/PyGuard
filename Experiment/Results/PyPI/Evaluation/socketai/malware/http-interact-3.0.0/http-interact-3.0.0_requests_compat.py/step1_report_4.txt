{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility handling for Python 2 and Python 3, as well as import resolution for JSON and other standard libraries for use in requests compatibility layer.",
  "sources": "The code reads module import attempts, Python version information, and standard library functions and constants.",
  "targets": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments; all imports and definitions are standard and common for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages imports with fallback options, determines Python version, and defines compatibility aliases. It uses try-except for optional modules, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The import logic and variable definitions follow common practices for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
