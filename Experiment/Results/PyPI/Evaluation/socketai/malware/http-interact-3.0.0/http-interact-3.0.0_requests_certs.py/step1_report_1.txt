  "sinks": "Printing the output of 'where()' to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> Call where() -> Print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward retrieval and printing of a CA bundle path. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a well-known, reputable package (certifi), then executes and prints its output. It does not process untrusted input, perform network requests, or contain any suspicious behaviors. The purpose is simply to display the location of the CA bundle, which is consistent with its documented purpose. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose of displaying the CA bundle path. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
