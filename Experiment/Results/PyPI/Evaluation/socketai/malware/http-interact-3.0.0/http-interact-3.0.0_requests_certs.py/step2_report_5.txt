  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same simple script: importing `where` from `certifi`, then printing its value.\n- The purpose is to output the default CA bundle path used for SSL verification.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and uses reputable libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code against the reports:\n- The code matches the described purpose and flow.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no untrusted input.\n- The logic is correct and minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Error, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning in the reports is accurate.\n- The code is simple and correct.\n\n**Note:** No modifications needed here.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Risk scores justification:\n- The overall risk is negligible; no malicious activity, no vulnerabilities.\n- Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are justified.\n- The confidence score of 1 indicates high certainty, which is appropriate.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity.\n\n### Obfuscated:\n- Confirmed as 0; code is straightforward.\n\n### Security risk:\n- Confirmed as 0; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or exploits.\n- The code is a utility script; no attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward utility that retrieves and prints a trusted library path. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores reflect this appropriately. No further action needed.",
