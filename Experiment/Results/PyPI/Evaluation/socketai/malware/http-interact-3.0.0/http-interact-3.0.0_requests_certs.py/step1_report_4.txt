  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path via 'where()' from the certifi library.",
  "sinks": "The path returned by 'where()' could potentially be used for security checks or certificate validation.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'where' from certifi, then outputs the CA bundle path when executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a well-known security-related library (certifi) and prints its output if run as a script. No untrusted input handling or complex logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to return the default CA bundle path for SSL verification. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code is safe and standard.",
