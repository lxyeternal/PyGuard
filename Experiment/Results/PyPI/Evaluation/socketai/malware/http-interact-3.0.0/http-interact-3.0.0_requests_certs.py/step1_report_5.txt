  "sources": "Import statement 'from certifi import where' and the print(where()) call in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the certificate bundle path, which could be used by other parts of a system or script.",
  "flows": "Code imports the CA bundle path and outputs it; there are no untrusted data flows or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation.",
