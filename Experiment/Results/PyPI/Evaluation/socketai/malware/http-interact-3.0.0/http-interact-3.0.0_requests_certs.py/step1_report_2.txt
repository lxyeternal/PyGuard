{
  "purpose": "This script provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct untrusted data sinks; the code simply outputs a file path based on the certifi package.",
  "flows": "The flow is: import 'where' from certifi -> main block calls print(where()) to output the CA bundle location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path. It includes a main block that prints this path. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no network operations. The script serves a clear, benign purpose related to SSL verification configuration. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility script to output the default CA bundle location from certifi. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. It appears to be a benign utility with no suspicious behavior.",
