  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from 'certifi' and calling it to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where' function from 'certifi' -> Sink: print() function output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward script that imports a trusted function from a reputable package and prints its output. It performs a single, well-defined task without any input processing, network activity, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The logic is correct, and the purpose is transparent and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and poses no security risk. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
