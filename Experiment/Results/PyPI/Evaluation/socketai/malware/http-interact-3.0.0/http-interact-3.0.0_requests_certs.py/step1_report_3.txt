  "purpose": "Return the preferred default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from certifi; calling 'where()' function in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path obtained from 'where()'.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi, then calls 'where()' and prints the result when executed as a script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward retrieval and print of a trusted CA bundle path. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a legitimate function from the well-known certifi package to retrieve the default CA bundle path. The main block only prints this path, which is a common and safe operation. There are no external inputs, no network connections, or code execution beyond this standard library call. The code's structure and purpose are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply outputs the path to the CA bundle used by the requests library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
