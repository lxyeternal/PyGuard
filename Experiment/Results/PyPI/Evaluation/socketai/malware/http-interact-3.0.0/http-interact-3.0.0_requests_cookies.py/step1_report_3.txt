{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including wrapping request and response objects, managing cookie jars, and converting between cookie representations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the request object (request.url, request.headers), and response headers (response._original_response.msg). Data flows through cookie extraction, setting, retrieval, and cookie jar updates.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can be injected into cookie headers via set(), set_cookie(), or update(). Cookie jar methods can modify internal state based on inputs. The get_cookie_header() function outputs cookie headers based on jar contents.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from responses and stored in jar; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies can be added or removed via set() or remove_cookie_by_name(). The flow involves reading request/response data, managing internal cookie storage, and outputting cookie headers.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs expected cookie management functions. No hidden network connections or malicious system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer for cookie handling within the requests library. It wraps request and response objects to mimic urllib interfaces, manages cookies through a RequestsCookieJar class, and provides functions for extracting, setting, and removing cookies. It handles cookie creation and conversion from Morsel objects. The functions and classes behave as documented, with standard implementations for cookie operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code appears legitimate, focusing solely on cookie management without external network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It simply facilitates cookie operations in a compatible manner.",
