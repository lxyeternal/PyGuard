{
  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, header creation, and cookie jar manipulation, to support cookie handling in requests.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, headers, and cookie data during cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie setting.",
  "sinks": "Generates cookie headers, modifies cookie jars, and extracts cookies from responses; no untrusted data directly causes harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from request headers and cookie responses flow into cookie creation and jar updates, but in a controlled, standard manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; functions are straightforward and use standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling functions, including wrapping request/response objects, extracting cookies, creating cookies, and managing cookie jars. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or network activity indicative of malware. The data flows involve typical cookie operations with no signs of malicious intent. The code is well-structured, clear, and relies on standard libraries, indicating benign utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.05) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
