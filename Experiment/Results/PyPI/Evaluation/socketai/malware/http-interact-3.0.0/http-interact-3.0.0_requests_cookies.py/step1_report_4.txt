  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities and classes for managing cookies in the 'requests' library, including wrapping and manipulating cookie jars, creating cookies, and extracting cookies from responses.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL and headers, extracts cookies from response headers, processes cookie attributes from Morsel objects, and reads data from cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Generates 'Cookie' headers for requests, manipulates cookie jars (adding, removing, updating cookies), and accesses response headers.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → Cookie extraction and header generation → Cookie jar management and cookie creation → Cookie updates and deletions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears standard for cookie handling. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management functionalities compatible with 'cookielib' and 'requests', including wrapping request/response objects, cookie extraction, cookie header creation, and cookie jar manipulations. It uses standard Python modules and typical patterns for cookie handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions and classes are straightforward, with clear responsibilities. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for cookie management within the 'requests' library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It provides utility functions and classes that facilitate cookie handling securely and transparently. Therefore, the likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
