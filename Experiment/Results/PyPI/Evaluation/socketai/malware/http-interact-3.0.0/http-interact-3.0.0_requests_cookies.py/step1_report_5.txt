{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, header creation, and management of cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from request objects, headers, cookie dictionaries, and Morsel objects. Cookie data is also obtained from response headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookies are set or removed from cookie jars, headers are generated for requests, and cookies can be added or cleared programmatically.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into cookie jars; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies can be set, deleted, or merged within the jar.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code primarily handles standard cookie management functions and compatibility wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions for cookie management, including converting Morsel objects to cookies, creating cookies from parameters, extracting cookies from responses, and managing cookie jars with dictionary-like interfaces. It contains standard handling of headers, domains, paths, and expiration attributes, with no suspicious or malicious operations. The functions are designed to facilitate cookie handling in the requests library context, with no network communications or system alterations. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. All operations are consistent with legitimate cookie management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities intended for use within the requests library. It performs no malicious activities or security exploits and appears to be a legitimate compatibility and management layer. No malicious intent or malware signals are detected.",
