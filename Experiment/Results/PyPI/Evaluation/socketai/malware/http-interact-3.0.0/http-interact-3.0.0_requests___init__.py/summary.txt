  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup routine for a widely used Python HTTP library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
