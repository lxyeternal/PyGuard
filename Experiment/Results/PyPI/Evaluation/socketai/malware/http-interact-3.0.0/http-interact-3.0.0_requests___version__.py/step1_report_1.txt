  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns static metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code declares metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, and __cake__, all with static string values. There are no functions, user input, external data reads, or suspicious code structures. No hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no obfuscated or dynamic code present. This is a typical package metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata for the 'requests' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
