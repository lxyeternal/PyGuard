  "sources": "Constants assigned to package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; this is purely metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains ASCII art comment at the top, which is benign. No suspicious or unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration for a Python package. It assigns static strings and integers to variables describing the package. No input handling, no execution, no external data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign package metadata with no malicious intent. It only contains static variable assignments for documentation purposes.",
