  "sources": "Constants and string assignments that do not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static assignment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments at the beginning; no other suspicious or malicious patterns or code obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of variable assignments containing package metadata. There are no external data sources, no input reading, no untrusted data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The ASCII art comment is benign and not indicative of malicious intent. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata declaration for the 'requests' package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
