{
  "purpose": "This code defines metadata attributes for the 'requests' Python package, providing descriptive information about the package such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals assigned to metadata variables (__title__, __description__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; only static assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; all code consists of straightforward variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code purely assigns static string and numeric values to metadata variables describing the package. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no cryptographic or credential handling. The presence of ASCII art is benign and for visual decoration. No code patterns indicative of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard metadata definition for the 'requests' package, with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security concerns identified. The code appears to be purely informational and safe.",
