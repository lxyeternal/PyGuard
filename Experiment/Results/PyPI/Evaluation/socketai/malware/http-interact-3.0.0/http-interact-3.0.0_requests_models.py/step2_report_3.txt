  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP request/response handling implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, given the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code, which is a well-structured, standard HTTP client component. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request/response handling with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical HTTP request/response implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate. The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request/response handling with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting the standard nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard, secure implementation with no malicious features.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign, standard implementation.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects the low inherent risk of such a library component.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across the board; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious patterns, a uniform low score (around 0.1 to 0.2) is justified.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the potential for misuse if untrusted data is passed, but overall, the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard, well-implemented HTTP client component with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
