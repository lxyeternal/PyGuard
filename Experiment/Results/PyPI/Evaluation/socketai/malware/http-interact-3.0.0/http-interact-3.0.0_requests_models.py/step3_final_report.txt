{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, providing classes for constructing, preparing, and managing HTTP requests and responses, including encoding, URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks; network transmission of request data; response raw data stream.",
  "sinks": "Headers, request body, cookies, response content, and hooks that may process or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are encoded and validated, then assembled into request objects; requests are sent over the network; responses are received, decoded, and stored; hooks and cookies are processed along the way.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code employs standard libraries and practices, with no unusual control flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, including request preparation, URL encoding, header validation, cookie handling, body encoding, and response parsing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The use of standard libraries and clear patterns indicates a legitimate and secure design. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential injection if untrusted data is mishandled externally, but this is inherent in network code handling untrusted input. The malware score is zero, as no malicious intent or behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is zero, reflecting code clarity. The risk score is around 0.2, acknowledging typical security considerations without indicating active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library, free of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
