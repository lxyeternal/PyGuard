  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard request/response handling, URL encoding, header validation, body encoding, cookies, hooks, etc.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; code appears standard and well-structured.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a typical HTTP client component. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious elements. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, describing standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with a legitimate HTTP library.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues found. The low malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard request/response classes, encoding, URL parsing, cookie management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Typical implementation; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; no malicious elements are evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous, standard request/response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code appears legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as others, standard request/response processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; secure practices followed.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, with minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent reasoning; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, justified by the absence of malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns—primarily the potential for injection if untrusted data is passed, but this is typical for such libraries.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed reasoning, the code appears benign and secure. The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mostly related to standard data handling concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No further adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure HTTP request/response handling implementation with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
