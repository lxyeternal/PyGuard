  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command during package setup, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The presence of suspicious URLs, silent execution, and error suppression further support this. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered malicious until decoded payloads confirm otherwise."
