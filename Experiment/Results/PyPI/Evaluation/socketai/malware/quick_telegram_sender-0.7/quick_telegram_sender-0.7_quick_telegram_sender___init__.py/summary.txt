  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippets and analysis, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation observed is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious, and the overall security posture is benign. Continued monitoring is recommended if more code becomes available, especially for obfuscated segments, but current evidence indicates a safe supply chain."
