{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; potential sources could be environment variables, function parameters, or file reads if present in unseen parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, or database access, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identifiable without additional code context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are immediately apparent. The code structure and variable names seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is minimal and lacks explicit input/output operations, external library misuse, or obfuscated elements. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The absence of visible network activity, credential handling, or malicious code constructs suggests benign behavior. Due to limited context, some assumptions are made, and a low confidence level is assigned.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities detected.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
