      "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands executed conditionally, with external URL involvement and silent error handling, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, external communication, and concealment tactics justify a malware score of 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.8. It should be treated as a high-security threat and removed or thoroughly analyzed before use."
