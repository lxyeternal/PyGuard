  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'lyft-stats' Python package, including a custom install step that runs a pre-install script.",
  "sources": "Import of pre_install module; execution of pre_install() within CustomInstall.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of pre_install() potentially executes external code; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import of pre_install -> invocation in CustomInstall.run() -> execution of pre_install script during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom install class to run external script; no direct evidence of malicious code, but running arbitrary scripts at install time can be risky if pre_install contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports and executes a pre_install() function during the installation process, which may contain arbitrary code. The code appears standard for a setup configuration, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. However, executing external scripts during installation can be a supply chain risk if the pre_install module is malicious or compromised. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident directly in this script. The URL and contact info seem benign, but the inclusion of a pre-install script warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a standard setup script with a custom installation step that runs an external pre-install script. While no explicit malicious behavior is evident, executing external scripts during installation introduces potential supply chain risks if pre_install contains malicious code. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
