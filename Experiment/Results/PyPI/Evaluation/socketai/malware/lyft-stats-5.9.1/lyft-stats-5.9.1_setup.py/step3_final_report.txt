{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a Python package with a custom installation step that executes an external script 'pre_install()' during installation, potentially affecting supply chain security.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pre_install' module and invocation of 'pre_install()' within the CustomInstall class's run method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pre_install()' during setup, which could execute malicious code if 'pre_install.py' is compromised.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls 'pre_install()' before proceeding with the standard installation, creating a source-to-sink flow where external code is executed during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes an external script without verification, and the URL provided is a placeholder ('http://notapplicable.notapplicable'), which may be suspicious or incomplete but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration that introduces a potential supply chain risk by executing 'pre_install()' during installation. No malicious code is present in the snippet itself; the risk depends entirely on the trustworthiness of 'pre_install.py'. The scores across reports vary, with malware scores around 0.5 to 0, and security risk scores from 0.2 to 0.6, reflecting uncertainty about the external script's content. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The primary concern is external code execution, which could be malicious if the script is compromised. Without inspecting 'pre_install.py', the risk remains theoretical but significant.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but executes an external script during setup, posing a supply chain security risk. The actual maliciousness depends on the trustworthiness of 'pre_install.py'. The overall risk should be rated moderate to high if the external script is untrusted, with malware likelihood around 0.6, obfuscation at 0, and overall security risk approximately 0.7.",
