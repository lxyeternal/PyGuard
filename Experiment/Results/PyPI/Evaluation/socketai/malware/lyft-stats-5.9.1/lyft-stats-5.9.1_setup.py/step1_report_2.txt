{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'lyft-stats', including a custom installation step that runs an external script 'pre_install.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data mainly from the 'pre_install' module and the setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'pre_install()' function could potentially be a sink if it executes malicious code, but its content is not shown. The setup script itself does not directly contain sinks that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'pre_install()' function is called, then the standard setup process proceeds. The flow depends on the implementation of 'pre_install()', which is external and not provided here.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the invocation of 'pre_install()' during installation without inspecting its contents. The download URL is a non-functional placeholder ('http://notapplicable.notapplicable'), which could be a placeholder or suspicious. The script itself is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard Python packaging tools from setuptools. It defines a custom install command that executes 'pre_install()' before proceeding with installation. Without the content of 'pre_install.py', it is unclear if malicious activity is present. The code appears typical for a package with a pre-install hook, with no evident malicious code or obfuscation. The placeholder URL may indicate incomplete or suspicious configuration, but on its own, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The invocation of 'pre_install()' could pose a risk if that script is malicious, but it is external and not part of this code. The package appears to be a standard setup script with a custom pre-install step, and no malicious code or suspicious activity is detected within this snippet.",
