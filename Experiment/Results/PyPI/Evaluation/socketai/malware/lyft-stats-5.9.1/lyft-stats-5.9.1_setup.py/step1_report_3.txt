{
  "purpose": "Define a setup script for a Python package named 'lyft-stats' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pre_install' module, calls 'pre_install()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or external connections present.",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers 'pre_install()' before proceeding with normal install.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external script 'pre_install' during setup could be suspicious if its content is malicious or unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package with standard setuptools. It defines a custom install class that runs 'pre_install()' before completing installation. The source of concern is the call to 'pre_install()', which is an external script/module. Without inspecting 'pre_install', it is uncertain what it does; it could perform any actions, including malicious behavior. However, within this code alone, there is no direct malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The setup is standard, but the presence of a call to an external script at install time is a potential supply chain risk depending on the script's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a typical setup script with a custom install step that executes 'pre_install()'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this code snippet alone, but the invocation of 'pre_install()' warrants review of that script for potential malicious activity. The overall security risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'pre_install'.",
