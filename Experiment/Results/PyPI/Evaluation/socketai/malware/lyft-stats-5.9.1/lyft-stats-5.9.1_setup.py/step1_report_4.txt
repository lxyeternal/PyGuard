{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'lyft-stats', including a custom install command that executes a pre-install script before installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, the 'pre_install' module, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or execute untrusted data; however, the 'pre_install()' function could potentially be a sink if malicious, but its content is unknown.",
  "flows": "The custom install class runs 'pre_install()' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code. After that, the standard setup process continues.",
  "anomalies": "The 'pre_install' module's content is not provided, making it a potential point of concern if malicious. The rest of the script appears standard for a setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process by executing a 'pre_install' script before proceeding with the normal install. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual code. The only point of concern is the 'pre_install()' call, which could contain malicious code if the module is compromised or maliciously modified. The setup parameters are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Since the content of 'pre_install' is unknown, confidence in benignity is limited, but the rest of the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script that executes a pre-installation script. Without inspecting the 'pre_install' module, there's limited visibility into potential malicious behavior. The setup code itself is benign and does not contain any obvious malicious or suspicious code.",
