{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'lyft-stats', designed to facilitate package installation with a custom pre-installation step.",
  "sources": "The script imports data from external modules ('setuptools', 'pre_install'), and potentially from the 'pre_install.py' script that is executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'pre_install()' function; potential for executing malicious code if 'pre_install.py' contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'pre_install()' is called before the actual installation process proceeds; any malicious behavior within 'pre_install()' could be executed at this point.",
  "anomalies": "The script dynamically runs a 'pre_install()' function without inspecting its contents; this could be exploited if 'pre_install.py' is malicious. No other anomalies are observed in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard packaging practices, importing 'setuptools' for packaging and defining a custom install command. It executes a function 'pre_install()' from an external module before completing installation. This design can be benign if 'pre_install.py' is trusted. However, executing code from an external file during setup poses a security risk if that file is malicious or compromised, as it could execute arbitrary code at install time. The rest of the code appears standard, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "While the main setup code appears typical, the execution of 'pre_install()' during installation is a potential security concern, especially if the content of 'pre_install.py' is untrusted or malicious. This pattern could be exploited to run malicious code during package installation, constituting a supply chain risk.",
