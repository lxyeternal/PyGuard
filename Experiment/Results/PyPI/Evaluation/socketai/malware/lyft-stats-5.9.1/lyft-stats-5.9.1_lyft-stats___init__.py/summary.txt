  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic execution features. The adjusted malware score of 0.6 for reports with obfuscation and 0.4 for those with unvalidated eval/exec better align with the observed features. The obfuscation and risk scores are proportionate, with a balanced overall security posture. Continuous monitoring and further deobfuscation are recommended to confirm or dismiss malicious intent."
