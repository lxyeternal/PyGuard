  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a general Python script potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from standard input, files, or environment variables; no explicit external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or prints to stdout; no clear malicious sink identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no suspicious source-to-sink flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious code structures observed; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined comprehensively at multiple points, including initial imports, functions, and main execution blocks. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system modification routines were identified. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard without suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques detected. The overall flow indicates legitimate processing with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a typical Python script without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
