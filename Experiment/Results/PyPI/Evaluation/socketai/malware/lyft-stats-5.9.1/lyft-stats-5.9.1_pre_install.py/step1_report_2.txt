{
  "purpose": "The code appears to execute a shell command that sends system information to an external URL, possibly for monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input data includes system commands such as hostname, whoami, pwd, and ls -la, embedded directly into the curl command via shell substitution.",
  "sinks": "The curl command sends data over the network to an external server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (hostname, whoami, pwd, ls) is incorporated into the curl command, which then transmits this information to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True with subprocess.run and embedding system commands within the curl command for data collection suggest malicious intent. The command gathers sensitive environment details and transmits them without authorization.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function pre_install that constructs a curl command with embedded shell commands for hostname, whoami, pwd, and ls -la. It then executes this command via subprocess.run with shell=True, which is a security risk. The command sends the gathered information to an external URL, indicating possible data exfiltration. The approach of embedding system commands directly into a network request, especially with shell substitution, is commonly associated with malicious activity such as system reconnaissance or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious behavior. It exhibits suspicious use of shell commands and network transmission, suggesting it is malicious malware or a backdoor intended for data exfiltration.",
