  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data inputs, dynamic code execution functions, network/file I/O, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, eval()/exec() calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) to sinks (network, eval/exec), potentially via indirect or obfuscated paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, indirect data flows, lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of benign data processing in most reports, with some reports showing obfuscation or dynamic code execution. Report 3's use of eval()/exec() with untrusted input is a significant security concern, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation in Report 2 raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious actions. The absence of suspicious patterns in Reports 1, 4, and 5 suggests low risk. Scores are generally aligned with these observations, though slight adjustments can improve accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code in most reports appears benign, with notable concerns in Report 3 due to dynamic code execution and in Report 2 due to obfuscation. Slightly increasing malware and obfuscation scores for Report 2 reflects these suspicions. The high confidence in benign assessments for Reports 1, 4, and 5 is justified. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by Report 3's behavior.",
