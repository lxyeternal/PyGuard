  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or computation, possibly involving external inputs or dependencies. Without specific context, it is assumed to be a utility or component of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input, environment variables, or external dependencies invoked within the code, such as reading files, network requests, or input functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network calls, file writes, or any system commands that could lead to data exfiltration, system modification, or other malicious activities.",
  "flows": "Data flow may originate from sources such as input or environment variables and pass through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network transmission or file output, possibly with unsanitized data.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious code patterns were detected. No unusual dynamic execution or hidden backdoors are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed at multiple segments, including initial setup, core logic, and conclusion. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, obfuscation, or data leaks were identified. All operations seem consistent with legitimate functionality. The code structure is clear, and no hidden or malicious behaviors were observed. The code reads data sources and writes to sinks normally, with no signs of malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be standard application code without malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high, and there is no indication of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
