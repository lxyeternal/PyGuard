{
  "purpose": "The code gathers and displays environment information related to the cryptography libraries, SSL, and Python environment.",
  "sources": "Reads system information, library versions, and environment variables such as sys.executable, sys.version, sys.platform, and sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Outputs environment info to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "Reads environment and library version data (sources) and outputs it via print() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. Usage of standard libraries and typical environment info gathering.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various SSL and cryptography modules and retrieves their version info, along with system information like Python executable path, version, and platform. It formats this data into a string and prints it out. The code functions as an environment diagnostic or info reporting tool. No data is sent over the network, stored insecurely, or executes malicious commands. The use of environment variables and system info is typical for debugging or logging purposes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code does not perform any potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign environment information script intended for diagnostic purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent was found.",
