{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather and display environment information related to the cryptography and SSL libraries used in the Python environment.",
  "sources": "Data is gathered from the 'version' module, OpenSSL, cryptography, cffi, sys, and environment variables such as sys.executable, sys.version, sys.platform, and sys.path.",
  "sinks": "The only output is printed to the console via print(_env_info); no data is sent over the network or stored.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and module attributes are read (sources) and then formatted into a string and printed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard cryptography-related modules and collects version and environment information about the SSL and cryptography libraries, as well as Python environment details. It then formats this data into a string and prints it. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to serve a diagnostic or informational purpose. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for environment information gathering and display, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
