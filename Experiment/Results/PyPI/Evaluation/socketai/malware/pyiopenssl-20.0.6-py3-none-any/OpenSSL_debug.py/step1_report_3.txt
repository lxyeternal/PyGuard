{
  "purpose": "The code gathers environment and version information related to SSL, cryptography, cffi, and Python for diagnostic or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system modules (sys, ssl), third-party libraries (cryptography, cffi, OpenSSL), and package version attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs environment info via print, which could leak system details if used maliciously, but in this context is benign.",
  "flows": "Collects data from imported modules and formats it into a string, then prints the information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. No external data input or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various security-related libraries and retrieves their version and configuration details. It formats this info into a string and prints it. No malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code performs environment diagnostics, which is a common practice for debugging or auditing purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign environment info gathering script with no malicious intent. It simply outputs version and environment details, which could be used for troubleshooting or auditing. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
