  "purpose": "The script gathers and displays environment information related to cryptography libraries and Python runtime details.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables and system information (sys.executable, sys.version, sys.path). Accesses cryptography library versions and OpenSSL version info.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs environment info; no external data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Source: environment and system info variables -> Sink: print(_env_info)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code is purely informational, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography-related modules and system modules, then formats environment details into a string and prints it. No external network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration observed. The purpose appears to be environment inspection. No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign environment information display script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
