  "purpose": "Gather and display environment and version information related to cryptography, SSL, and Python runtime details.",
  "sources": "Reading version attributes from imported modules, system executable path, and system information variables.",
  "sinks": "Printing the formatted environment info to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source data (module versions, system info) is formatted into a string and then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward info collection and printing without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography, cffi, OpenSSL, and system modules, constructs an environment info string with version and system details, and prints it. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is standard for diagnostic purposes, with clear and straightforward logic. All version attributes are retrieved using safe, standard library calls. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is observed. The purpose is purely informational, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment information script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and behavior, assigning appropriate scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0. The analysis is consistent and justified, indicating no security concerns.",
