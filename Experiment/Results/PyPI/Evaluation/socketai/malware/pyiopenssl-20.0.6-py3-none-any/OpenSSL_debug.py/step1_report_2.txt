{
  "purpose": "The script collects and displays environment information related to cryptography and SSL libraries, likely for debugging or environment validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (sys.executable, sys.version, sys.platform, sys.path), library versions (cryptography, cffi, OpenSSL), and version attributes from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs environment info via print(), which is a benign action here; no untrusted data is processed or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, module attributes, and system modules flows into the formatted string, then is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply gathers and outputs environment info; it does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several cryptography and SSL libraries and constructs a detailed environment info string. It retrieves version info, OpenSSL details, and system parameters. The data is only used for printing purposes. There are no external data inputs or outputs beyond printing; no user input, network activity, or file operations are present. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment information collector intended for debugging or informational purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
