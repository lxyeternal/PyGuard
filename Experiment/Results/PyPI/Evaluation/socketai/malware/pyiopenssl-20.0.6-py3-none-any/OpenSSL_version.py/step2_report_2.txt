  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a standard `__init__.py` file for the pyOpenSSL package, defining package metadata such as version, author, license, and description. It contains only static string assignments and a list of exported symbols (`__all__`). There are no functions, dynamic code, external data inputs, or network interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and matches typical package metadata files. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in report logic?**  \n  The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies or security risks. They are consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code contains only static metadata definitions; no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior are present. All reports agree on malware score 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used. All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Since the code is purely metadata with no external interactions, no vulnerabilities or security risks are present. The assigned scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, straightforward package metadata module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores reflect this, and the analysis confirms the absence of security issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
