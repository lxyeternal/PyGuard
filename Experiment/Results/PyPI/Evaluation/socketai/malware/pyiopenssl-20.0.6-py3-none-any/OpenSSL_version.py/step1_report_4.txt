  "purpose": "Define metadata and import information for the pyOpenSSL Python wrapper module.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; only metadata variables are defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no execution flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines module-level metadata such as author, version, license, and description. It does not include any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The formatting, comments, and structure are typical for a package metadata module, and there are no indicators of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
