  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a standard Python module that defines package metadata: version, title, URL, summary, author, email, license, and copyright. It also specifies the `__all__` list for exports.\n\n**Security and Malware Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code contains only static variable assignments and comments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or external data processing.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or metadata module for a Python package.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Anomalies:**\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No external dependencies or inputs that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - The code's purpose is solely to define package metadata, which is inherently benign.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n4. **Reasoning for Scores:**\n   - The code is static, well-documented, and follows standard conventions.\n   - The reports uniformly agree on its benign nature.\n   - No assumptions are made about external threats; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (all zero or one with high confidence) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe package metadata module with no security concerns.",
