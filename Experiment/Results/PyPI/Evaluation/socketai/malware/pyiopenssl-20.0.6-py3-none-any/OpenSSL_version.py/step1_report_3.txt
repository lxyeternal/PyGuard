{
  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and documentation for the pyOpenSSL library, a Python wrapper around the OpenSSL cryptographic library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables and comments. No external input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted inputs; the code only assigns static values to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script defines metadata variables for the pyOpenSSL package, including version, title, URL, summary, author, email, license, and copyright. It uses string formatting for the copyright line but no dynamic or external data. The comments are standard licensing comments and documentation. No functions, user input handling, network calls, or other potentially malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The likelihood of malicious activity is extremely low.",
