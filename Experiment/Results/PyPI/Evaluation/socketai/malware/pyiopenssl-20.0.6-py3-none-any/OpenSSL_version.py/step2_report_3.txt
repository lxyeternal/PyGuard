  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward metadata module for the pyOpenSSL package.\n- They consistently identify no dynamic data, no external input, no suspicious code patterns, and no malicious behavior.\n- The code only assigns static string values to module variables and defines the `__all__` list.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Code Confirmation:**\n- The actual code provided matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- It is a typical `__init__.py` style module defining package metadata.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign and purely metadata.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate given the code content.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which is justified.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty based on static analysis.\n\n**Justification for Scores > 0.5:**\n- No report assigns a score higher than 0.5 for malware or risk, which is correct.\n- The code is non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on static analysis, and no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely metadata with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The consistent high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard package metadata module.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scoring and conclude that this code poses no security concern.",
