  "purpose": "Define module metadata and constants for the pyOpenSSL Python wrapper library",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "targets": "None; the code does not interact with untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there are no input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "Code primarily consists of metadata definitions, license information, and module attributes; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only defines metadata variables (__version__, __title__, etc.) and a list of public API exports (__all__). It includes comments about copyrights and licensing. There are no dynamic executions, data reads, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements are present. The content is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package's metadata initialization and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
