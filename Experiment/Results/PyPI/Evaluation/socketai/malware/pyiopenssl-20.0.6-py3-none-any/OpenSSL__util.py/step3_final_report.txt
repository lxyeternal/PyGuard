  "sources": "Error queue retrieval via lib.ERR_get_error(), path input via os.fspath(), string inputs in text_to_bytes_and_warn().",
  "sinks": "Exception raising in exception_from_error_queue(), potential data retention in no_zero_allocator, warnings emitted during string conversion.",
  "flows": "Errors from lib.ERR_get_error() flow into exception_from_error_queue() which raises exceptions; path and string inputs are converted and used in cryptographic functions; no_zero_allocator manages memory for large allocations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of no_zero_allocator which does not clear memory after allocation, and deprecation warning for string handling indicating transitional API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cryptographic error handling, data conversion, and memory management functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The use of a no-zero allocator is a documented performance optimization that may leave sensitive data in memory longer, but it is not malicious. The deprecation warning about string inputs reflects transitional API usage. Scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to memory handling considerations. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation; the code appears legitimate and secure within its intended utility scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility module for OpenSSL error handling and data conversions. Minor concerns about memory retention due to the no-zero allocator are documented and do not indicate malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
