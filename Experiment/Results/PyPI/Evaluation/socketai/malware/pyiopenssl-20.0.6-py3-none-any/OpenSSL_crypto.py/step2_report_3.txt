  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** No issues detected; code is a standard wrapper for OpenSSL cryptography functions.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely a cryptography wrapper with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The error handling and memory management appear standard. No suspicious flows or data exfiltration.\n\n**Verdict:** **No concerns.** The code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; detailed cryptography wrapper with no malicious intent.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (slightly above zero, possibly due to deprecation warnings)  \n- **Comments:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The deprecation warnings are benign and indicate ongoing maintenance.\n\n**Verdict:** **No malicious activity.** Slightly elevated risk score is acceptable due to deprecation warnings, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a comprehensive cryptography wrapper with no suspicious flows or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (similar reasoning as above)  \n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious behavior, just use of deprecated functions, which is a maintenance concern.\n\n**Verdict:** **Safe.** No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard cryptography API wrapper, no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n- **Comments:** No malicious intent detected; deprecation warnings are normal.\n\n**Verdict:** **No issues.** The code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a cryptography wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n- **Comments:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** **No concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code is a standard cryptography wrapper, with no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code is transparent, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** The minor elevation to 0.2 is justified by deprecation warnings, which are normal in maintenance and do not imply malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — due to deprecation warnings, which are benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard cryptography API wrapper around OpenSSL, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects maintenance status rather than security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture is sound, and the code appears safe for use.",
