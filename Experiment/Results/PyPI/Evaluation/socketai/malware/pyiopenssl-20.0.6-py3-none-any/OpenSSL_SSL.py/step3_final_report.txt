{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python wrapper around OpenSSL's SSL/TLS functionalities, managing contexts, connections, certificates, keys, protocols, and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system certificate files, user-supplied callbacks, socket inputs, configuration files, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "OpenSSL internal functions, callback handlers processing untrusted data, network transmission, and certificate verification routines.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and files flows into OpenSSL configuration; untrusted callback data flows into verification, OCSP, ALPN, and cookie functions; socket data flows through send/recv methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; extensive use of internal OpenSSL functions via CFFI is standard for low-level bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a detailed SSL/TLS interface, wrapping OpenSSL with proper resource management, exception safety, and callback handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage signals are present. Data flows are controlled, and no signs of data leaks or malicious network activity are evident. The use of callbacks introduces potential misuse if callbacks are malicious, but this is inherent in SSL/TLS APIs and is mitigated by exception handling. Compatibility fallbacks and environment-based configurations are standard. Overall, the code appears secure and trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured SSL/TLS wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the callback complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose aligns with standard SSL/TLS management, and no supply chain security concerns are evident.",
