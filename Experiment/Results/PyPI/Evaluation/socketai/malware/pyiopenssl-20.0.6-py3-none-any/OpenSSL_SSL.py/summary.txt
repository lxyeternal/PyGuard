  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured SSL/TLS wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the callback complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose aligns with standard SSL/TLS management, and no supply chain security concerns are evident."
