{
  "purpose": "Provides wrappers for managing the OpenSSL PRNG, including reseeding and status checking.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'buffer' parameter in the 'add' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'lib.RAND_add' and 'lib.RAND_status' functions interface with OpenSSL's randomness source; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'buffer' input into 'lib.RAND_add' to reseed the PRNG, and the status function retrieves seed status from 'lib.RAND_status'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code structures observed. Usage of OpenSSL's PRNG functions is standard for cryptographic modules.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a thin wrapper around OpenSSL's randomness management functions. It allows adding entropy to the PRNG state and checking its seed status. The implementation includes type checks to ensure correct input types. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. Usage aligns with best practices for entropy management in cryptographic contexts. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign wrapper for OpenSSL's PRNG management functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a cryptographic utility and does not perform any harmful actions.",
