{
  "purpose": "Provide routines for managing and reseeding the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'buffer' parameter in the add() function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the OpenSSL _lib.RAND_add() function to add entropy to the PRNG and _lib.RAND_status() to check seed status; these are internal OpenSSL functions.",
  "flows": "The buffer data flows from the input parameter into _lib.RAND_add(); status checks flow from _lib.RAND_status() to the return value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code mainly wraps OpenSSL functions for entropy management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides thin wrappers around OpenSSL functions for adding entropy to the PRNG and checking its status. It performs type checks on inputs to ensure they are bytes and integers, respectively. It does not include any network activity, file operations, or other suspicious behavior. The functions are designed for reseeding in specific scenarios like process forking. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be standard, well-documented, and secure in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG functions with no signs of malicious behavior. It is intended for cryptographic entropy management and does not pose security threats on its own.",
