  "purpose": "Manage cryptographic entropy by adding data to the PRNG and checking its seed status.",
  "sources": "Input buffer in add() function; internal OpenSSL functions RAND_add() and RAND_status().",
  "sinks": "OpenSSL internal functions; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input buffer -> RAND_add(); seed status check -> RAND_status().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward wrapper with input validation; no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-documented wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG functions, performing input validation and calling internal cryptographic functions. It does not perform network, file, or suspicious operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard cryptographic utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard utility for managing cryptographic entropy, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
