{
  "purpose": "Manage and seed the OpenSSL cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) by adding entropy and checking seed status.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'buffer' (bytes) and 'entropy' (int) in add(); internal calls to '_lib.RAND_add' and '_lib.RAND_status()'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to '_lib.RAND_add' and '_lib.RAND_status()' functions from the OpenSSL library, which interact with the system's PRNG state.",
  "flows": "User supplies 'buffer' and 'entropy' to 'add()', which then passes these to '_lib.RAND_add'; 'status()' queries '_lib.RAND_status()' to check seed status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Code strictly wraps OpenSSL PRNG functions with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple interface to add entropy to and check the status of OpenSSL's PRNG. It includes input validation to prevent incorrect types, which reduces risk. The functions directly invoke OpenSSL's internal methods without any obfuscated or malicious logic. The purpose is standard for cryptographic seed management, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign wrapper around OpenSSL's PRNG management functions, designed for reseeding in specific scenarios like process forking. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
