  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity such as remote payload download or execution. Silent error handling further conceals possible malicious behavior. While the package setup appears normal, the embedded obfuscated command poses a significant security threat. Decoding the command is recommended for further analysis. Based on the evidence, the package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
