  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or system operation, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be fully determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions such as input(), sys.stdin, environment variables via os.environ, or external data fetched through network requests.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks involve network calls, file operations, subprocess executions, or system commands that could handle untrusted data or execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like input or environment variables to sinks such as system commands, network sockets, or file writes, potentially allowing malicious input to influence sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the specific code. However, suspicious patterns include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review requires examining the entire code. Without the actual code snippet, this remains a template analysis: identify input points, trace data movement, and check for unsafe handling. Look for hardcoded secrets, eval(), exec(), or subprocess calls with unvalidated inputs. Also, check for obfuscation or unusual language features that may mask malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively identify malicious behavior. No obvious malicious patterns are apparent without the code. The review is limited to general risk factors based on common indicators.",
