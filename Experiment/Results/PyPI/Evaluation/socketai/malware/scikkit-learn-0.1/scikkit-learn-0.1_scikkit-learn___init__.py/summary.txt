  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The original reports' scores are justified based on the evidence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, and absence of malicious indicators. High suspicion in reports 1 and 3 warrants high malware and risk scores, while the others are correctly scored as benign or non-evaluable. The overall assessment confirms the scores are consistent and appropriate."
