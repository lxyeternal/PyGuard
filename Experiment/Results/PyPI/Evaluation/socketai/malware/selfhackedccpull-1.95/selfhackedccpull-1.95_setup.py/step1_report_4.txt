{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'selfhackedccpull', including some potentially malicious code that executes a PowerShell command to download or run external content.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists('tahg')) and executes a subprocess with a PowerShell encoded command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command, which could potentially download or run malicious code from an external server.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) triggers execution of a PowerShell command (sink), which may download or execute remote malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of an encoded PowerShell command that runs without user consent, hidden window creation, and a check for a specific file ('tahg') suggest suspicious activity. The URL in the PowerShell command points to an external domain (esquelesquad.rip), which is potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'setup' from distutils.core, then tries to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It checks if a file named 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64. This command appears to download or execute content from a suspicious domain. The setup() function defines a package, but this is standard in Python packaging. The execution of the PowerShell command without user interaction or clear purpose indicates malicious intent, likely to download or execute malicious payloads silently.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior, specifically the execution of an encoded PowerShell command to potentially download or run malicious code from an external domain. The setup code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious payload execution. Overall, the code demonstrates likely malicious intent and should be treated with high suspicion.",
