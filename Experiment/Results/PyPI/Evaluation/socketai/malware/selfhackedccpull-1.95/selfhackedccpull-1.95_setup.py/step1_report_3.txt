{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'selfhackedccpull'. It includes package metadata and an attempt to execute a potentially malicious PowerShell command if certain conditions are met.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system (checking for the existence of 'tahg') and from environment variables (indirectly via the subprocess command). It also uses import statements and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, which could be used to run malicious code or establish backdoors. The command is hidden from view (WindowStyle Hidden) and uses encoded PowerShell commands, indicating potentially malicious intent.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of 'tahg' -> if not found, it runs a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess -> the setup function defines package info but does not interact directly with the malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded, hidden, and executes without user consent. The URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' embedded in a comment and the encoded command suggests malicious or covert behavior. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding any failures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and attempts to run a PowerShell command if a directory 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded and executed in hidden mode, likely to evade detection. The package setup appears legitimate but is accompanied by suspicious behavior designed to execute remote or malicious code. The try-except blocks hide errors, making detection more difficult. Overall, the code combines legitimate package setup with covert malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a covert PowerShell command designed to run hidden, encoded code, likely malicious. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the presence of encoded command execution indicates malicious intent and possible system compromise. The malware score is high due to hidden encoded payload execution, and the security risk is significant.",
