  "conclusion": "The package contains high-confidence malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, triggered by filesystem checks, with references to suspicious URLs. The silent execution and obfuscation increase suspicion. It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis (decoding the payload) confirms otherwise."
