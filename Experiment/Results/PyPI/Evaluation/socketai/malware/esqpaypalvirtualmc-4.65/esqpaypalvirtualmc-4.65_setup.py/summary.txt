  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The embedded URL, obfuscation, and silent execution strongly suggest malware or backdoor activity. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised, and the embedded payload warrants further analysis. The overall security risk is high."
