{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows, anomalies, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; dynamic code execution functions such as eval or exec; network calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, or file operations that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data originating from sources like environment variables or user input flows into sinks such as network sockets or file writes, possibly via dynamic execution or indirect calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, indirect function calls, suspicious import patterns, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks explicit malicious payloads or suspicious network activity. The suspicion is primarily based on indirect calls and code complexity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data leaks are evident. The overall structure suggests cautious suspicion rather than confirmed malicious intent. The code's benign nature in the absence of explicit malicious patterns supports low malware and risk scores, with higher obfuscation suspicion appropriately reflected in the obfuscated score.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic features but no definitive malicious activity. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with a slight adjustment to malware suspicion in line with obfuscation levels. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring if obfuscation persists.",
