  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context or comments, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables and function parameters. No external data sources are explicitly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to logs and returned from functions. No evident data exfiltration or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or parameters flows through processing functions and is logged or returned, with no external transmission evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are identified. The code uses dynamic execution functions only in a benign context. No obfuscation, unusual language features, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code involves standard data handling and logging operations. No external network calls, credential theft mechanisms, or system damage routines are observed. The usage of environment variables and function parameters appears standard. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leakage are detected. The overall structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or malware. The absence of suspicious external communications or hidden behaviors suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility or processing script with no evident threats. Confidence in this assessment is high, and the code shows no obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
