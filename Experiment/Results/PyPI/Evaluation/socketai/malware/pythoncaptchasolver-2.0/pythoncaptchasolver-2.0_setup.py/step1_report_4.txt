{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pythoncaptchasolver', with an unusual behavior of executing remote code and attempting to run a temporary file.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL via urlopen, and creates a temporary file that contains executable code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the temporary file with system call (_ssystem), which runs the code stored in the temporary file.",
  "flows": "The remote URL content is written into a temp file, then the system command executes the temp file, which contains code that fetches and executes remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic code execution: fetching remote code and executing it locally, using a temp file. The remote URL points to a potentially suspicious source. The use of system commands to start the executable is also suspicious. The code appears to be designed to run arbitrary code from a remote server at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup functions, and temporarily writing a Python script that fetches and executes remote code from 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw'. It then attempts to run this temp script via system command, which can lead to execution of malicious remote code. The setup function appears standard but is likely a decoy or secondary component, while the core behavior involves fetching and executing remote code at runtime, indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it downloads and executes remote code without validation, potentially allowing remote control, backdoor access, or malicious payload execution. The primary purpose appears to be malicious remote code execution rather than legitimate setup tasks.",
