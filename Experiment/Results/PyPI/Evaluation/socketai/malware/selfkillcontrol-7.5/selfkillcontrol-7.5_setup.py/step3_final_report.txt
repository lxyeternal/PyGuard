  "purpose": "Detects obfuscated PowerShell command execution during setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Presence of 'tahg' check, obfuscated subprocess.Popen call, encoded PowerShell command, suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell, remote URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip'.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' -> execute obfuscated PowerShell command silently -> potentially connect to malicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent exception handling, execution triggered by absence of 'tahg'.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' and, if absent, runs a hidden, encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen. The command is obfuscated, likely malicious, and references a suspicious domain. Silent error handling conceals failures. The setup appears standard but is used as a cover for malicious activity. Scores assigned (malware 0.85, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified given the evidence of obfuscation, remote domain, and covert execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated PowerShell payloads executed silently, referencing a suspicious domain, and hiding errors. It should be treated as malicious, warranting high malware and risk scores.",
