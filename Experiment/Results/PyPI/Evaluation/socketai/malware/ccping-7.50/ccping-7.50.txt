      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious activity such as establishing backdoors or downloading payloads. The behavior warrants high security concern, and the package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further analysis of the payload is performed."
