{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, MFA secrets, cookies, passwords, and browser data. It injects malicious scripts into Discord, kills processes, copies itself into startup for persistence, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file hosting services. It also performs account hijacking and system manipulation.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files (Login Data, Local State, cookies), logs, environment variables, Discord API responses, local files, logs, logs in logs and databases, system environment variables, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhooks, external file hosting services (gofile.io, anonfiles), process termination commands, code injection into Discord directories, self-copying into startup folders, and network requests for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data collection from local browser and system files, decryption of stored credentials, injection of malicious scripts into Discord app files, exfiltration via webhooks and uploads, process killing to hide activity, and self-replication for persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs and injection URLs, self-copying into startup folder, process termination commands, dynamic dependency installation, layered obfuscation, and extensive data collection routines.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors including credential theft, process killing, code injection, persistence, and data exfiltration. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, injects scripts into Discord, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and external hosts. It also disables security features and maintains persistence by copying itself into startup folders. The code employs threading and dynamic dependency installation, indicating an advanced malicious tool. The activities are consistent with credential and system hijacking malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer with capabilities for account hijacking, system sabotage, and stealth operations. It performs extensive data collection, injection, and exfiltration, making it extremely dangerous. The behaviors are clearly malicious and align with the scores of maximum threat levels.",
