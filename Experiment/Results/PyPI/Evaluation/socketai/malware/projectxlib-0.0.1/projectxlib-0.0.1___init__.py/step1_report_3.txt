{
  "purpose": "The code appears to function as a malicious information stealer targeting Discord tokens, MFA codes, passwords, cookies, and browser data, while also providing exploit functionalities such as token misuse, account takeover, and data exfiltration via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input, files in browser profiles, logs, cookies, saved passwords, local storage, and network responses (IP geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and external servers (Gofile.io, anonfiles). Data is collected from Discord API endpoints, browser storage, local files, and system info, then sent remotely.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from user tokens, browser files, logs, and environment variables are processed and sent to external servers via HTTP requests, webhooks, or uploaded files. Data flow from data sources (browser files, logs, environment) to sinks (webhooks, file uploads).",
  "anomalies": "Obvious malicious intent evidenced by continuous token extraction, account takeover procedures, Discord token abuse, environment-based self-termination on blacklisted users/hostnames, webhook-based data exfiltration, token manipulation, and account credential theft activities. The code automatically installs dependencies, kills Discord processes, modifies Discord desktop files to inject malicious code, and exfiltrates sensitive data including MFA, tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser data. Use of hardcoded webhook URLs, aggressive process termination, and attempts to steal MFA, cookies, and passwords strongly indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks and terminates execution if the user or machine is blacklisted. It installs necessary dependencies like requests and pycryptodome. It gathers browser and application data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and local storage by reading specific directories and files, decrypts encrypted data with Windows API calls, and uploads this data to external file hosting services. It also injects malicious code into Discord desktop app files by overwriting 'index.js'. It continually scans for Discord tokens, MFA secrets, and logs, then exfiltrates collected information via Discord webhooks. The code contains functions for token validation, account info retrieval, data collection, and exfiltration. It also includes features for account hijacking, MFA enabling/disabling, and stealing sensitive data. The presence of self-replication (copying itself to startup folder), process termination of Discord, and injection of malicious scripts into Discord installations indicate deliberate sabotage and malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to harvest sensitive user data, hijack Discord accounts, and exfiltrate information through webhooks and file uploads. Its activities include environment manipulation, data theft, process killing, and code injection, all pointing toward malicious intent with high security risk. It should not be used or trusted under any circumstances.",
