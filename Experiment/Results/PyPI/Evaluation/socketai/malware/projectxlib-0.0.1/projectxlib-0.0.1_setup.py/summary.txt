  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. The minor configuration issues are not security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0, and the risk score can be considered negligible (~0.1). No further action is necessary."
