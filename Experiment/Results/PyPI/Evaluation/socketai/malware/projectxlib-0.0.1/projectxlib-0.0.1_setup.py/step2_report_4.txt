  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The setup script reads static files, defines package metadata, and has an empty 'install_requires' list. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (minor misconfiguration, not security concern).\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk aligns with the benign nature of the code. The empty 'install_requires' and 'url' are configuration issues, not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static data and standard setup. No untrusted data or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, only minor configuration omissions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious activity, no dynamic code, no network interaction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard setup script, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward setup script, reading static files and defining package metadata.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate. The minor configuration issues (empty 'install_requires' and 'url') are not security risks but should be fixed for correctness.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores should stay at **0**.\n- The overall security risk should be **0**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment, but the risk scores could be lowered to 0 to reflect the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific recommendations.",
