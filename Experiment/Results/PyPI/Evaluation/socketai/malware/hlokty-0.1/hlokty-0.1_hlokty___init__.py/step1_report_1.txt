  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow identified in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a function named 'main' from a relative module, likely part of a larger package. There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or data exfiltration. It is a standard import statement commonly used in Python packages. Given the limited scope, no security concerns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
