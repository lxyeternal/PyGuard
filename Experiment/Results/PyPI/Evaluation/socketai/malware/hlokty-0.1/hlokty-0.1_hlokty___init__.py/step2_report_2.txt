  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple import statement: `from .main import main`.\n- None mention any suspicious behavior, code execution, or malicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard, and typical in Python projects.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward import statement.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious control flow are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports suggest obfuscation.\n- **Data flows:** No data flows are present, as expected.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are present in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent: minimal code, no suspicious patterns, standard practice.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which matches the lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- The scores are consistent with the descriptions.\n- The confidence levels are high, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the overall findings: the code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a standard import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
