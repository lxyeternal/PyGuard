  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own 'main' component during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single-line import statement.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'main' from the same package/module, with no data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import of 'main' from the local package/module. It is a standard Python import statement with no indication of malicious intent. Since it only imports a function, there are no source-to-sink flows, data leaks, or anomalies. The snippet is too minimal to suggest malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. It does not pose security risks based on the provided content.",
