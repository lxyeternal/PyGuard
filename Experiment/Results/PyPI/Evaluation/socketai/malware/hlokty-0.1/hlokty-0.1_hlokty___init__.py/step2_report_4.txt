  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple import statement: `from .main import main`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are involved beyond the import.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python practice for internal module import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code snippets are benign import statements.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- No errors, flaws, or security issues are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All describe the code as a benign, straightforward import.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty.\n- Malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.\n- Same conclusions: benign import, no malicious intent.\n- No reason to adjust scores.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0 for all.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe import statement with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
