{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from a local module, serving as a typical component of a Python package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'main' from the local module, with no data transfer or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard relative import in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import is typical for package initialization or internal module referencing. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are involved. The code's simplicity and adherence to common practice strongly suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, straightforward import statement, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code's clarity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified, indicating no threat or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
