  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function from the local 'main' module, likely for executing the main logic of a package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('main')",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only contains an import statement, with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. It is a simple relative import",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'main' function from a local module named 'main'. This is a common practice in Python scripts or packages to organize code. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious control flow is present. The snippet does not include any dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or other malicious indicators. Given its simplicity, it is unlikely to be malicious, and there are no anomalies or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project structure.",
