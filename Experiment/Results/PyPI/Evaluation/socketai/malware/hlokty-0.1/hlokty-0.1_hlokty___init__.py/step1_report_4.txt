  "purpose": "Importing the 'main' function from a local module 'main' within the package",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs here",
  "sinks": "No sinks; this code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is just an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Unusual in that it uses a relative import with a single dot; however, this is a common practice in package internal structure and not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement using a relative import syntax. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or file operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
