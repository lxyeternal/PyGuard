  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- It reads a README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.\n- The only notable anomaly is the inclusion of `'*.exe'` in `package_data`. This is unusual for a Python package but not inherently malicious.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The author is listed as `'unknown'`, which is not suspicious by itself but could be worth noting.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Presence of `*.exe` in package_data**\n\n**Analysis:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that including `*.exe` files in package data is unusual but not necessarily malicious. It might be intended for Windows-specific tools or auxiliary files. Without inspecting the actual files, there's no evidence they are malicious.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports assign a low `securityRisk` (0.1 or 0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo change needed here.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Entry point `hlokty=hlokty.main:main`**\n\n**Analysis:**  \nReport 5 notes that this could execute potentially malicious code if the `main()` function contains harmful code. However, the setup script itself cannot determine the content of `main()`. The risk depends on the actual implementation within the package, which is not provided.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The setup script is benign; the potential for malicious behavior depends on the package contents, not the setup code.\n- The report correctly identifies this but maintains a low malware score.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores are appropriate, but if there were evidence that `hlokty.main:main` contains malicious code, the malware score should be increased.  \n- Since no such evidence is provided, current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Author is \"unknown\"**\n\n**Analysis:**  \nSome reports mention this as unusual. While it might be a minor concern, it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo impact on security scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Overall code quality and obfuscation**\n\n**Analysis:**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores of 0 for obfuscated code and malware are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5: Confidence levels**\n\n**Analysis:**  \nMost reports have high confidence (0.9 or 1), which seems justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1-0.2).  \n- **Confidence:** High, as the code is simple and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the inclusion of `*.exe` files, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The entry point could be a vector if the package contains malicious code, but the setup script alone does not confirm this.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slight concern due to inclusion of executables and unknown author, but overall benign)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe setup script appears benign and standard. The only potential concern is the package content itself, which cannot be assessed from this script alone. The current scores reflect this understanding accurately.",
