  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'hlokty' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; loading package metadata; specifying package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup configuration does not handle or process external input at runtime.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process is static and based on local files and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The inclusion of '*.exe' files in package data is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious patterns are present. The inclusion of executable files (*.exe) in package data is uncommon but not malicious, possibly intended for Windows compatibility or auxiliary tools. No obfuscated code or code injection observed. The author is listed as 'unknown', which might be worth noting, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the inclusion of '.exe' files in package data, which is unusual but not harmful per se. Overall, the code appears benign.",
