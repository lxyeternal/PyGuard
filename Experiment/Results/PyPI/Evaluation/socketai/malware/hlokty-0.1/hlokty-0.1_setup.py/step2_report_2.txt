  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity detected; inclusion of '*.exe' files is unusual but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The inclusion of '*.exe' files is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code execution or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The score of 0.2 for security risk seems reasonable, given the unusual package data but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup, with unusual inclusion of '*.exe' files.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious behavior, no code execution, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup, '*.exe' in package data is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Reasoning is sound. No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; benign setup, with the note on '*.exe' files being unusual.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) due to the unusual inclusion of executable files, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The only report suggesting potential concern is the mention of the entry point `hlokty.main:main`, which could execute code. The report notes that maliciousness depends on the package content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** While the setup script itself is benign, the fact that it sets up an entry point that executes code warrants some caution. However, without inspecting the actual package content, there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Justification for risk score of 0.2:** It reflects the potential risk if the package contains malicious code, but since the setup script itself doesn't execute any code beyond defining the entry point, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the provided code. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable. The only point of consideration is Report 5, which assigns 0.2 due to the entry point.\n\n**Is this justified?**  \nYes. The setup script is standard, and the only potential concern is the execution of the `main` function. Without evidence of malicious code, a low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The inclusion of '*.exe' files is unusual but not malicious.\n- The entry point could execute malicious code if the package is compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to the potential for malicious code in the package content, but not evident from the setup script itself)\n\n**Overall, I would set:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential concern about the executable files and entry point, but not a confirmed risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the setup script appears benign. The minor risk score reflects caution but no actual malicious activity.",
