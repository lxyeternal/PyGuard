{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'hlokty', intended for experimental and educational use.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or network activity within this code.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description; packages setup parameters flow into package installation configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Includes executable files ('*.exe') in package data, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file, specifies dependencies, entry points, and package data. The inclusion of '*.exe' files in package data is unusual and might be intended for distribution of Windows executables, but it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, primarily configuring package metadata and distribution details. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
