{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'hlokty' Python library, primarily for experimental and educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses find_packages() to locate package modules; specifies dependencies in install_requires; defines entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "Entry point 'hlokty=hlokty.main:main' executes a main function from the 'hlokty' package, which could potentially be malicious if the package contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "The setup process installs dependencies, defines executable scripts, and installs package data; if the 'hlokty.main:main' function contains malicious code, it will execute upon script invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The package data includes '*.exe' files, which could be suspicious if unintended, but may be harmless if legitimate; the author is 'unknown', which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evident malicious code in this configuration. The inclusion of '*.exe' files in package data warrants caution, but without inspecting the actual files, this is not confirmed malicious. The entry point setup suggests the package executes a main function, which could be malicious if the package content is harmful, but the setup script itself is benign. Overall, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this script alone.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the execution of the 'hlokty.main:main' function upon installation or run, which depends on the package contents. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious indicators are evident.",
