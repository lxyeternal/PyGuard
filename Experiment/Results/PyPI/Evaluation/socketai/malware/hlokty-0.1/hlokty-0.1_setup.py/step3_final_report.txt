{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and include executable files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; package_data includes '*.exe' files; defines entry point 'hlokty=hlokty.main:main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no code execution or data leaks within setup script.",
  "flows": "Setup configuration flows from reading files to defining package data and entry points; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Packaging '*.exe' files is unusual for a Python package but not inherently malicious; author listed as 'unknown' which is not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The inclusion of '*.exe' files is uncommon but not malicious. The entry point 'hlokty.main:main' could execute code if malicious, but the script itself does not contain or execute any harmful code. The author being 'unknown' is not a security concern. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9-1). No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with the only notable anomaly being the packaging of '*.exe' files, which does not imply malicious intent. The potential risk depends on the actual content of the package, which is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat, and the scores are justified.",
