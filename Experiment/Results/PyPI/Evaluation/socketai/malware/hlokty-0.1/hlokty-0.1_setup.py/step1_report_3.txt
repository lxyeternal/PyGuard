{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'hlokty', including metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; defining package metadata and dependencies; specifying entry point for console script.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code is straightforward package setup logic.",
  "anomalies": "Including '*.exe' files in package_data is unusual for pure Python packages, but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line execution. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The inclusion of executable files (*.exe) in package data is uncommon but not malicious; it may be for distribution purposes. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are detected. Overall, the script performs standard setup operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The inclusion of executable files in package data is unusual but not inherently malicious. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
