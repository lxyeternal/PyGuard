  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with the only notable anomaly being the packaging of '*.exe' files, which does not imply malicious intent. The potential risk depends on the actual content of the package, which is outside the scope of this script. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat, and the scores are justified."
