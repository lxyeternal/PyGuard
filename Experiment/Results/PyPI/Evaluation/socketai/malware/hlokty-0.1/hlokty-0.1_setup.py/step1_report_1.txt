  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for packaging the 'hlokty' Python library, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; defining package data; specifying dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or malicious output present.",
  "flows": "No malicious or unusual source-to-sink data flows detected; standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "The inclusion of '*.exe' in package_data is unusual but not inherently malicious; it might include executable files in the package. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The only notable anomaly is packaging '.exe' files, which is unusual but not suspicious without additional context. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate configuration for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
