  "anomalies": "Use of a known security testing/tracking domain (oastify.com), no encryption or validation, no user consent prompts",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects environment data and sends it to an external server. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The URL is suspicious, indicating potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious actions are detected. The data flow is simple and direct, with no validation or encryption, raising privacy concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.2-0.4, security risk 0.4-0.6) are conservative; given the behavior, malware likelihood is low but exfiltration is a concern. The overall behavior suggests privacy-invasive activity rather than active malware. The scores should be adjusted slightly higher for security risk but lower for malware, reflecting the absence of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious per se but performs privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious domain. It lacks malicious payloads or code execution. The primary concern is privacy and potential misuse, not active malware. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly adjusted to better reflect the low likelihood of malware and moderate security risk.",
