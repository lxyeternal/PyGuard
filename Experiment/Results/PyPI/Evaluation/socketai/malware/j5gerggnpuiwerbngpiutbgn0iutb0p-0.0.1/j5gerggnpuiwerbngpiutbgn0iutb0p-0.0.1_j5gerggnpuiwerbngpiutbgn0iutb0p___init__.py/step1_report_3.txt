  "purpose": "Collect environment information (package name, hostname, current directory) and send it to a specified external server.",
  "sources": "Reading package name (__package__), hostname (os.uname()), current directory (os.getcwd()).",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Source variables (PACKAGE_NAME, HOSTNAME, CURRENT_PATH) are packaged into 'data' and sent via HTTP POST request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts a suspicious external URL (oastify.com), which is commonly used for security testing and may indicate malicious or maliciously intended data exfiltration. The data sent includes environment info that could be used for tracking or fingerprinting.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system environment details and sends them to an external server over HTTP. The URL used is a known OAST (OASTify) domain, often associated with security testing or tracking purposes. The data collection is straightforward with no obfuscation, but the external contact and data sent could be part of a malicious activity such as fingerprinting or exfiltration. There are no other malicious functions such as code execution, data theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be designed for surveillance or tracking rather than malicious sabotage but can be used maliciously depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment data collection and transmits it to an external server, which could be benign or malicious depending on intent. Given the external URL and the data being sent, there is a potential for malicious tracking or exfiltration. No obvious malicious payload or backdoor is present, but the behavior warrants caution.",
