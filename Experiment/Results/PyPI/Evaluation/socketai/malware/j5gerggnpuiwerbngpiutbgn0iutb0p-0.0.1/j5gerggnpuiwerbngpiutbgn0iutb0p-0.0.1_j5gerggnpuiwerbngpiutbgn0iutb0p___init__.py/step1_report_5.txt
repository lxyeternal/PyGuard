  "purpose": "Collect system information such as package name, hostname, and current working directory and send it to a specified remote URL.",
  "sources": "Reads package name (__package__), hostname (os.uname()), and current directory (os.getcwd()).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to a remote URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Source data (package name, hostname, current directory) is gathered and transmitted over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a suspicious domain (oastify.com) which is often associated with security testing and C2 infrastructure; no validation or encryption of data; the code is straightforward but could be used maliciously for information exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment-specific system details and sends them to a remote server without any validation, encryption, or user consent. The domain used is known for security testing and C2 purposes. There are no apparent obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads. However, the act of exfiltrating system info to an external server is suspicious, especially if done without user knowledge. No malicious code execution or backdoor is present, but the behavior aligns with data collection for malicious or tracking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main function is to collect and transmit system information to an external server. The domain used is associated with security testing, which raises suspicion about potential malicious intent or tracking. While no explicit malware or harmful code is present, the exfiltration behavior is concerning in a malicious context. Overall, the code exhibits moderate security risk due to data exfiltration without safeguards.",
