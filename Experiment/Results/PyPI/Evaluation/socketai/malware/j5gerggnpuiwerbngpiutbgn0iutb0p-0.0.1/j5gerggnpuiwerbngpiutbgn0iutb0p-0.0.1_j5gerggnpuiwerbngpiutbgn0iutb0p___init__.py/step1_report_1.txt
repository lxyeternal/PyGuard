  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() to a remote URL with collected system data",
  "flows": "Gather system info (package name, hostname, current path) -> send via HTTP POST to external server",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded external URL that appears suspicious; no validation or encryption of data; no user consent or indication of benign intent",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as package name, hostname, and current directory, then sends this data unencrypted to a suspicious external URL. The use of a third-party URL with an unusual domain suggests potential data exfiltration. The data transmission occurs without user awareness or consent. No other malicious behavior such as command execution or data manipulation is present. The code appears designed to silently gather and transmit system data, which could be malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of data collection but sends the data to a suspicious external server without apparent purpose or user consent, indicating possible malicious intent or data exfiltration behavior. It does not contain obfuscation or overt malware but exhibits privacy and security concerns.",
