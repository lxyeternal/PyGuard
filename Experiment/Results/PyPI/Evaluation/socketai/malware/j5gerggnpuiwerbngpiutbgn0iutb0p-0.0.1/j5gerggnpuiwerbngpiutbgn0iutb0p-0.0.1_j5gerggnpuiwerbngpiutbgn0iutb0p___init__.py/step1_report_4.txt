  "purpose": "Collect environment information and send it to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "os module functions (__package__, os.path, os.uname, os.getcwd), requests.post",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the specified URL, which transmits data to an external server",
  "flows": "Environment data (package name, hostname, current path) is gathered and sent directly to the remote URL via HTTP POST",
  "anomalies": "The URL used is a suspicious, non-standard domain (oastify.com), often associated with security testing or tracking; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and requests modules. It constructs environment info: package name (or directory name), system hostname, and current working directory. It then posts this data to a remote URL. The use of a known security testing domain suggests potential tracking or malicious intent. There are no other suspicious code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The functionality appears straightforward: gathering environment info and transmitting it externally.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects basic environment information and sends it to an external server, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. The use of a suspicious URL raises security concerns, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy violations.",
