      "conclusion": "The script is benign in execution but intentionally designed with metadata that could facilitate or simulate supply chain attacks. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious code exists. The obfuscated score remains high (~0.8) due to the package name. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), considering the potential for misuse based on the package's metadata and description."

      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious per se but performs privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious domain. It lacks malicious payloads or code execution. The primary concern is privacy and potential misuse, not active malware. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly adjusted to better reflect the low likelihood of malware and moderate security risk."
