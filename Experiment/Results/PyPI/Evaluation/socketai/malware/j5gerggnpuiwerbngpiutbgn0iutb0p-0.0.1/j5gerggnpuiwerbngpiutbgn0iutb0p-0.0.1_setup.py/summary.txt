  "conclusion": "The script is benign in execution but intentionally designed with metadata that could facilitate or simulate supply chain attacks. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious code exists. The obfuscated score remains high (~0.8) due to the package name. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), considering the potential for misuse based on the package's metadata and description."
