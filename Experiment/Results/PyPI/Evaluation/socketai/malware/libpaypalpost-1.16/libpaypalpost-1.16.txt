      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to the execution of obfuscated PowerShell code during setup, which could be used for system compromise or data exfiltration. The package setup code appears benign but is likely a cover for malicious activity. The high obfuscation and hidden execution justify high malware and risk scores."
