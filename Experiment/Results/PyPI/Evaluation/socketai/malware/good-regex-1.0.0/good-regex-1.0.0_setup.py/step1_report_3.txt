{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), and the external requests.get call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Requests.get call to an external domain with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, current directory, username) collected from sources flows into the requests.get call, which transmits this data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The external URL is suspicious and appears obfuscated or non-standard; data is sent during installation without user consent or explicit warning. No validation or security checks on the request. The code runs during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The URL appears obfuscated and may be malicious, intended to collect user system info silently. This behavior resembles a data exfiltration or backdoor mechanism embedded in a package installer. The use of a generic or obfuscated URL without user consent is concerning, and this pattern indicates potential malicious intent or at least suspicious data collection activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior by collecting system info and sending it to an external server during installation without user awareness. This is indicative of potential malicious intent or a security risk. The package should be considered suspicious, and its installation could compromise user privacy and security.",
