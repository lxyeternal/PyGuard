  "purpose": "Package setup script with custom installation behavior that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote server with collected system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Upon installation, the code collects system info (source) and transmits it via an HTTP request (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: sending system info to a remote URL during package install without user consent; use of obfuscated or suspicious URL; lack of user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after performing standard installation, gathers system information (hostname, current directory, username). It then makes an HTTP GET request to a specified domain, sending this info as URL parameters. The domain appears suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it could be used to track or collect system info covertly. The URL is obfuscated, and the purpose of data collection is not disclosed to users, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential data exfiltration, raising security concerns. The URL and behavior suggest malicious intent.",
