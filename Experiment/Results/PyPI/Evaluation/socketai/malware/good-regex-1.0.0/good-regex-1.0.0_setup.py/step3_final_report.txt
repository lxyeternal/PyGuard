{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it to a suspicious external URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with URL parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) flow into URL parameters of requests.get() which transmits data to an external domain",
  "anomalies": "Data collection and exfiltration occur during installation without user notification; URL appears suspicious and obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install run method, gathers system info, and sends it via HTTP GET to a hardcoded, suspicious domain. The activity is silent, occurs during package setup, and involves an obfuscated URL, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The sources are system info functions; the sink is the network request; the flow is from sources to the external URL. The URL's suspicious appearance and the covert nature of data transmission are anomalies. The behavior aligns with malicious backdoors or tracking mechanisms, with high potential for privacy violations and malicious exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration during package installation to a suspicious domain, indicating malicious intent. The activity is privacy-invasive, with high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with malware and risk scores close to 0.9, and obfuscation around 0.8, reflecting the suspicious URL and malicious behavior.",
