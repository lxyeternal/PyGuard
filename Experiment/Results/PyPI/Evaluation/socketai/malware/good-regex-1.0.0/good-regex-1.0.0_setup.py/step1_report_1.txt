{
  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process for a Python package, attempting to send system information to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external server, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and passed as URL parameters in requests.get(), transmitting system info to an external domain during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The external URL appears obfuscated or intentionally obscured; the code performs network activity during installation without clear user consent. The URL is suspiciously formatted, resembling a potential C2 or tracking domain. The code does not log or document this behavior explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process by overriding the run() method in a custom class. After completing the normal install steps, it collects system info and sends it to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL. The URL appears suspicious, possibly used for tracking or malicious data collection. No other malicious actions are evident, but the network activity during package install is concerning and could be exploited for malicious purposes such as fingerprinting or command-and-control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to secretly collect and transmit system information during package installation, which indicates malicious intent or at least privacy violation. It uses obfuscated domain names and performs network activity without user consent. This behavior could be used for tracking or more malicious purposes if controlled by an attacker.",
