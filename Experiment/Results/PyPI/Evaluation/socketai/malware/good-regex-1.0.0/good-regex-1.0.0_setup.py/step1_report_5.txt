  "purpose": "Package setup script that customizes installation behavior by sending system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.get to send data to an external server, potentially exposing sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows from the source functions into the requests.get call as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending potentially identifiable system info to an external, hardcoded URL during installation. The URL is suspicious and not a typical setup endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and third-party requests. It defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects system info and sends it to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This action occurs automatically during package installation without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and looks like a test or malicious server. The code does not sanitize or restrict data, nor does it inform the user, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The overall intent appears to be covert data collection during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains code that collects system information and transmits it to a remote server during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior suggests possible tracking or reconnaissance activity without user awareness.",
