{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that reports system information to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Data collection occurs in the CustomInstall.run() method, specifically the hostname, current working directory, and username obtained via socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends collected data to an external URL, acting as a network sink that transmits potentially sensitive environment information.",
  "flows": "The flow is from data sources (hostname, cwd, username) to the sink (requests.get() call) which transmits the data to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used ('fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com') is a known testing domain for data exfiltration and reconnaissance. The code executes during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The request is unconditionally made without user consent or configuration options.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setup and system info collection. It defines a custom installation class overriding run() to execute standard install and then perform an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL, transmitting system details. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or system fingerprinting during package installation. The URL used is known for malicious testing or C2 channels. No input validation, authentication, or user confirmation is present, increasing concern. The code's purpose appears to be collecting and transmitting system information surreptitiously when the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious-like behavior by sending system details to an external server during installation, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The use of a known malicious domain and the execution during install indicate potentially malicious intent.",
