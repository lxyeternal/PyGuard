{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'imagesolverpy' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no operations involving untrusted data or external communications.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a straightforward package setup script without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'install_requires' list, which may be unintentional but is not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata for the package. No input reading, environment variables, or external data handling present. The 'install_requires' field is empty, which might be an oversight but is not inherently malicious. The code structure is standard and minimal, without obfuscated elements or unusual patterns. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious code, supply chain threats, or security vulnerabilities.",
