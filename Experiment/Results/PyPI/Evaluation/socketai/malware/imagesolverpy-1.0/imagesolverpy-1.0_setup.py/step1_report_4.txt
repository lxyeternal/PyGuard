  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'imagesolverpy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'install_requires' list; no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static metadata such as package name, version, license, description, author, keywords, and classifiers. No external input, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling present. The empty 'install_requires' indicates no additional dependencies, which is valid but not suspicious. Overall, the setup configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
