{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging and installation parameters for the Python package 'imagesolverpy'.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, including package name, version, license, description, author, keywords, install_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present, as the code does not handle untrusted input or perform runtime operations that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists of static configuration data without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The 'install_requires' field is set to an empty string within a list, which may be unintended but does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script using setuptools to prepare a Python package. It contains static metadata without dynamic or runtime components. The empty 'install_requires' list may be a minor oversight but does not pose security concerns. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign and typical use of setuptools.",
