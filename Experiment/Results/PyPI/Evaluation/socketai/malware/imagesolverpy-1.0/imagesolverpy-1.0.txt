The minor anomaly regarding 'install_requires' is not a security concern but should be corrected for proper dependency specification. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate."

The scores are consistent with its behavior, with a high malware and security risk score, and a low to moderate obfuscation score. It should be flagged as malicious and prevented from execution in secure environments."
