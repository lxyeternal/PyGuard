  "purpose": "A trivial Python script defining a main() function that prints '...'.",
  "sources": "The code defines a function 'main()' which outputs static text; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only contains a print statement within a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function with no external dependencies, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code does not invoke 'main()', but this does not impact security assessment. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
