{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for a Python package setup, but it also contains code that downloads and executes an external file based on the platform, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL via requests.get and opens a file to write this data locally. It also uses os.system to execute the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The open() function writes the content of the remote URL to a file, and os.system executes that file, which can be malicious executable code.",
  "flows": "The code fetches data from the URL, writes it to a local file, then executes that file, creating a source-to-sink flow from the URL to system execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function zzr() conditionally executes a remote executable only on Windows, and the URL points to a raw executable file, which is suspicious. The script downloads and runs a binary without any validation or user consent, indicating malicious behavior. The rest of the code is standard setup, but the presence of remote code execution is highly anomalous.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard setup imports but then defines a function zzr() that, only on Windows, downloads an executable from a GitHub URL and runs it immediately. This is highly suspicious, as it introduces remote code execution. The setup() function appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious code in zzr(). The URL points directly to an executable, and no checks or validation are performed before execution. This pattern strongly suggests malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or malware loader. The overall code structure indicates the malicious component is intentionally hidden among legitimate setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a clear malicious payload that downloads and executes an external executable only on Windows systems, representing a high security threat. The remaining setup code appears standard, but the malicious behavior dominates the analysis.",
