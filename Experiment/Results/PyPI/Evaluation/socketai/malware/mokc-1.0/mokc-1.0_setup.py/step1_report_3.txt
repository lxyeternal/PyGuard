{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'mokc' that installs dependencies and contains a function to download and execute an external file from the internet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data primarily from the network via 'requests.get' to fetch a remote executable, and from the system environment when calling 'os.system'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'os.system', which runs the executable on Windows systems. Also, the code performs network requests that could potentially leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "The script fetches a remote executable from a URL and then immediately runs it using 'os.system', creating a source-to-sink flow from network input to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'zzr' unconditionally downloads and executes an external executable only on Windows. The URL points to a raw file on GitHub that appears to be an executable, which is suspicious. The package setup includes no actual functionality but includes this malicious behavior, indicating potential sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining a function 'zzr' that checks if the platform is Windows. If so, it downloads an executable from a GitHub URL and executes it immediately. On non-Windows systems, it exits. The setup configuration declares package metadata but contains no other logic. The direct download and execution of an external executable during package installation is highly suspicious and indicates malicious behavior. The presence of this code suggests an attempt to deliver malware upon installation or setup. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external Windows executable during package setup, which is a clear security threat. This code is highly suspicious and should not be trusted or used.",
