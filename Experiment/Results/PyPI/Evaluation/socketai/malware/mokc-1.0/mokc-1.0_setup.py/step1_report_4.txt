{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'mokc' and, upon execution, download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL if the platform is Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL via requests.get, specifically the executable at 'https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe'. It also reads local environment variables via 'os.system' and potentially from the setup configuration, but primarily from the URL and request.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is written to disk and then executed with 'os.system('start ' + filename)', which could run malicious code if the URL is malicious. The system call to execute the downloaded file is a sink where untrusted data (the downloaded executable) is executed.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a request to a remote URL to fetch an executable, saves it locally, then immediately executes it on the host machine. The flow is from the URL (source) to the file system write, then to the execution sink.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'zzr()' unconditionally downloads and executes an external executable only on Windows systems, with no validation or verification of the content. The URL points to a suspicious domain with a raw GitHub link that may be obfuscated or malicious. The code does not perform any integrity check or user notification before executing external code. The 'setup()' function appears standard, but the pre-execution behavior is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary malicious behavior is downloading and executing a remote executable, which could be malicious. The code is minimal, with no obfuscation, but the unconditional execution on Windows and the external download raise suspicion. The rest of the setup configuration appears normal for a Python package, but the initial download-and-execute step is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. There are no signs of code obfuscation, but the behavior itself is malicious. The code relies on the platform check to trigger the malicious action. Overall, the script exhibits malicious intent with high confidence due to the external code execution without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where it downloads and executes an external executable on Windows systems without any validation, representing a significant security risk. The setup configuration appears legitimate, but the execution flow demonstrates malicious intent. This package should be treated as malicious due to its behavior.",
