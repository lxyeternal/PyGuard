{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package called 'py-hackedccencode' with specific package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg', and executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes a PowerShell command, which may run arbitrary code. The setup function is called afterward for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is Base64-encoded and executed with hidden window flags, indicating potential obfuscation. The script includes a comment referencing suspicious URLs ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and contains code that attempts to run a hidden PowerShell process, which is suspicious in package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then attempts to run an obfuscated PowerShell command if the 'tahg' directory does not exist. This command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The script then proceeds with a typical package setup call, which appears benign. The obfuscated PowerShell command and the comment referencing a suspicious URL are major red flags. The code appears designed to execute arbitrary, possibly malicious, PowerShell code during package installation or execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code that executes a hidden PowerShell command during setup, indicating malicious intent. The presence of suspicious URLs, obfuscated commands, and the execution of code without clear necessity suggest this package is malicious or compromised.",
