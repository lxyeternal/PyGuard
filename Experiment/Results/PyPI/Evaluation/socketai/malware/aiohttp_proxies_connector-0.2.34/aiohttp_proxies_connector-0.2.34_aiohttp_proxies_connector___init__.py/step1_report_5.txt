{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a proxy connection library, including error classes, connection helpers, and proxy types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, defines __version__ and __all__, and exports symbols; no data flows from untrusted sources or to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script, importing components and defining export symbols. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or include any malicious logic. The structure suggests a standard library setup for a SOCKS proxy implementation.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It functions as a standard Python module for a proxy library without any suspicious elements.",
