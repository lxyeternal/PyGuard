  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string (__version__ = \"0.1.2\").\n- Sets __all__ to expose specific symbols.\n- Contains no runtime logic, network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup, likely an __init__.py or main module for a SOCKS proxy package.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup for SOCKS proxy handling.\n- Findings: No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a straightforward module initialization code with no malicious intent. The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Defines imports, version info, exports for a proxy connection package.\n- Findings: No data sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, this is typical package setup code. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exports components related to SOCKS proxy library.\n- Findings: No data handling, network activity, or anomalies.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exports for proxy connection handling.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no data leaks, no anomalies.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nStandard module setup, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Module exports for proxy library.\n- Findings: No data processing, network activity, or anomalies.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with previous findings.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard module setup with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  The code is purely for organizing imports and exports, with no runtime logic or external interactions. Therefore, a security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that there are no assumptions or vulnerabilities in this code snippet.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, typical package initialization code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is safe, always consider that this is just a small snippet. If future code includes dynamic code execution, network handling, or untrusted input processing, re-evaluation would be necessary. But based on the current snippet, no issues are present.",
