  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is standard package setup, importing modules, defining version, and __all__. No data flow, no external communication, no obfuscation, no malicious indicators.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard module initialization code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; the code organizes imports and exports without runtime logic or data handling. No anomalies or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and conventional.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign package setup.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern: imports, version, __all__, no runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or suspicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe module.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; no runtime logic, data flow, or external communication.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Typical, benign package code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; module setup, no data processing, no external actions, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports confirm that the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication.  \n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None identified; the code is typical for module initialization.  \n- **Scores assigned:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Risk scores:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, the risk scores should remain very low or zero.  \n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious behavior is detected, malware scores should stay at 0.  \n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they focus on static analysis and structural safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is safe and contains no malicious elements.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy package. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.",
