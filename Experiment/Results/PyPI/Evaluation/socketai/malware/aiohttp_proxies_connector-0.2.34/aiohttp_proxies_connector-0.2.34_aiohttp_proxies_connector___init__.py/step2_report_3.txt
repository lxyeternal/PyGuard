  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python module, likely an `__init__.py`, that imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and an `__all__` list to specify the public API.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- They note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n- Confidence is high (1), and malware/security risk scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports accurately describe the code as a straightforward module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None needed; the code is purely organizational.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  No malicious activity or intent is indicated. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code structure.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n  Yes. The scores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's harmless, organizational purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclude that this code snippet poses no security threat.",
