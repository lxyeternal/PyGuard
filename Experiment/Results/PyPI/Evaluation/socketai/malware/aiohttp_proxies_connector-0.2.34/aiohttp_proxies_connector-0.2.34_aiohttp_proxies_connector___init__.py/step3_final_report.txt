{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing classes, functions, and constants related to SOCKS proxy handling, and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string definition, and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read untrusted input or write data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only sets up exports.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing necessary components and defining __version__ and __all__. It contains no runtime logic, network activity, or data handling. All signals indicate benign, organizational code typical for a package's __init__.py. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and content align with a safe, non-malicious module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script for a SOCKS proxy package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
