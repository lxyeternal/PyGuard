  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the details with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string (`__version__ = \"0.1.2\"`).\n- Sets `__all__` to specify public API exports.\n- Contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as part of a SOCKS proxy package setup.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard package setup code, with no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, it describes module setup for proxy handling.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above, describing the module's role in proxy connection handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Also describes the code as a straightforward import/export module for proxy connection components.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar to previous reports, noting no data leaks, suspicious code, or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Logic flaws or reasoning errors:** None; all reports correctly interpret the code as a benign package setup.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code contains only import statements, versioning, and export definitions, with no runtime logic or external communication, the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** or possibly very close to zero, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign an overall estimate based on the content, I would agree with the reports' assessments, reaffirming a **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, and **risk = 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard module initialization for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**",
