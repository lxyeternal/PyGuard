  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a typical Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or main module, importing classes/functions from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and exposes symbols via `__all__`.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n- The structure is standard for a package setup, with no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: They all describe the code as a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy package, managing imports and exports.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code is straightforward and typical.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports indicate that the code is a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. This aligns perfectly with the code snippet provided.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores Given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, with securityRisk also at 0. These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk above 0.5, and given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified. No malicious behavior or code is present.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n  All claims are cautious and based on the code's content, not assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n  The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code snippet is purely structural, setting up exports for a proxy library.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- The consistent assessment across all reports confirms the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the code and reports, **the code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for a Python package setup.** No changes are necessary to the scores or analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the evidence at hand.",
