{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling, defining exports and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external communications are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only import statements and module exports are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident; code structure is standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, assigns a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It is typical module setup code with no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears clean, with proper organization and no unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy package, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is safe and aligns with typical package initialization practices.",
