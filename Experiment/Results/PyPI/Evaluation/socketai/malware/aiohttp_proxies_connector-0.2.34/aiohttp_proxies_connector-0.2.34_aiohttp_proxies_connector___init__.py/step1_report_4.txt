{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export components related to proxy connection handling, such as connectors, error types, and helper functions, for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; only module exports and imports are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily imports and exports symbols without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments observed. The version number is standard and the structure is typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific components from sibling modules and exposes them via __all__. It defines a version string and does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, secret leakage, or supply chain attack mechanisms. The structure suggests a well-formed package structure for proxy handling functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package module with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It solely manages imports and exports of components related to proxy connections. There are no suspicious activities, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious code behaviors detected.",
