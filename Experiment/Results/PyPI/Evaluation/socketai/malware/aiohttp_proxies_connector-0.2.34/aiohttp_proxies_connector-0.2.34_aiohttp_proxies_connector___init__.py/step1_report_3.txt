{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports components related to a SOCKS proxy connection library, including error classes, helper functions, and connection types.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the setting of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily declares imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module setup for a Python package, importing internal classes and functions and defining the module's public API. It sets a version string and exports specific classes and functions. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious code, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard part of a SOCKS proxy library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a module initializer and API definition without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
