  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or executable logic.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as part of an error handling framework.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n   - The exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with no embedded logic.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**:\n   - No claims or implications of vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of exception class definitions.\n   - The reports do not suggest any assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The overall assessment is that this code is a standard, safe component with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes**:\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling.\n- There are no hidden payloads, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is safe and non-malicious.",
