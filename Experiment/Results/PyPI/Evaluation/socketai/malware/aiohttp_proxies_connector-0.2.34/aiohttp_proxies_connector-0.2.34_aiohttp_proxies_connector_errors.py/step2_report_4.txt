  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n- No data input/output, external interactions, or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- All exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as a structured error handling framework.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code matches the original code snippet provided. There are no discrepancies, errors, or issues in the class definitions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is purely structural, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as non-executable, non-malicious class definitions.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the code's actual content.",
