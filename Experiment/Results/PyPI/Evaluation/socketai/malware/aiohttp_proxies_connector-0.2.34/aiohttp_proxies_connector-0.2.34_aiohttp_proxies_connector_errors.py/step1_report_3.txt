  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present. The structure is straightforward, serving to categorize different error types related to SOCKS proxy and authentication errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase for error handling.",
