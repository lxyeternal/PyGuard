  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data flows, external interactions, or embedded logic. The classes inherit straightforwardly from built-in exceptions, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Risks**:  \n   Every report explicitly states that there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely structural, intended for error handling, and does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain any executable logic beyond class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. This is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security Risk / Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no embedded logic, no anomalies, and no external data handling, the scores seem appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n\n- I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code appears safe and non-malicious.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0  \n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scoring accurately reflects its security posture.",
