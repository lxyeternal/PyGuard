  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or output operations; solely exception class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-output pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Exception classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from built-in exception types, with no embedded logic, data manipulation, or external interactions. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The code appears to serve as an error handling framework component, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
