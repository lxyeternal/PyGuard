  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exceptions to manage SOCKS proxy errors. All classes inherit from standard Python exception classes and contain no executable logic, external data handling, or side effects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard error handling structure for a proxy-related module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be a benign, structural part of a larger proxy-related library.",
