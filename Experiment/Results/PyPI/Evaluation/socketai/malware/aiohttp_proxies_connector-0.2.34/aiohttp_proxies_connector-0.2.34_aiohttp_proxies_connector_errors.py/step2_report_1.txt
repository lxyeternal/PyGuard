  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining a set of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n- They consistently state that the code contains no input/output, data flow, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty based on the provided information.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature described.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The original code matches the reports: it only defines exception classes with no embedded logic, data, or external interactions.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward error handling framework component.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the analysis.\n- The purpose of the code is purely structural, serving as part of a larger error handling system.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which is reasonable given the code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made, which is appropriate.\n- The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores given in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risks, the overall risk score should remain at 0.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is straightforward in its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and appropriate for its purpose.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
