  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors to facilitate error handling in network communication modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no data input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; solely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond class inheritance; static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of custom exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exceptions with no embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code serves as a structural component for error management. The reports' assessments are consistent, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
