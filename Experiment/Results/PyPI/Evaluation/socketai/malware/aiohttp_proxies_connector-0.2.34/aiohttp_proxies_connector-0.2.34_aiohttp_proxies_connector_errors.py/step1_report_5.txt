{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors for use in network programming.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance hierarchy; no external data input or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present that could process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present, as this is purely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, used for error handling in network communication scenarios involving SOCKS proxies. No input, data processing, or external communication occurs. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python module that defines error types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as exception class definitions for network error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe component of a larger network-related project.",
