{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data read operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No output or data handling, no untrusted data processing or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception subclasses with no embedded logic, no suspicious or unusual patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines a set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection error handling. There are no functions, data processing, external data inputs, or code execution. All classes are straightforward subclasses of standard Python exceptions, with no additional logic or data. The absence of executable code, network interactions, or data handling indicates no malicious intent or security risks. The structure is clear, and the code appears to serve as part of a larger exception handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely a collection of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard, safe setup for error handling in a network proxy context.",
