  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n   - The original code confirms this: no data processing, no external interactions, no embedded logic.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious elements.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious logic, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The current scores (all zero or one with high confidence) are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious elements, and the reports correctly reflect this.",
