  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The code handles proxy connections securely and transparently.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's straightforward nature, standard libraries, and absence of suspicious patterns, these scores seem appropriate.\n- **Potential issue:** None. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero, reflecting the fact that untrusted proxy URLs are processed, which could, in theory, be exploited if the proxy URL is maliciously crafted. However, this is a common pattern in network code, and the risk is minimal.\n- **Potential issue:** The score seems reasonable; the code does not introduce significant risk beyond typical proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is deemed legitimate, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is justified given the code's functionality, which involves parsing URLs and establishing network connections, but nothing malicious.\n- **Potential issue:** The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard, transparent, and safe nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher than 0.1, possibly due to the fact that the code accepts untrusted inputs for proxy URLs and credentials, but this is typical for such utilities.\n- **Potential issue:** The score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is considered legitimate with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments; the code is a standard network utility.\n- **Potential issue:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code snippets are consistent across reports, and no malicious or obfuscated patterns are evident.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. The only minor point is that the code processes untrusted URLs, which is typical but could be flagged as a potential risk if misused. However, this is standard for proxy utilities.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, justified by the potential for misuse of untrusted inputs, but not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1-0.2** — acceptable for network code handling untrusted inputs; no significant security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, standard, and free of malware or obfuscation.**",
