  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies, including URL parsing and socket creation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters for host, port, proxy credentials, and optional proxy URL.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection functions, and socket communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, proxy URL) -> parse_proxy_url -> create_socket_wrapper -> connect socket -> open_connection or create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; standard URL parsing, socket creation, and connection handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It parses proxy URLs, validates inputs, creates socket wrappers, and connects to target hosts. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The handling of untrusted inputs (proxy URLs and credentials) is typical for such utilities, with proper validation and error handling. The overall design aligns with standard network programming practices, and no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection management. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the handling of untrusted inputs. Overall, it appears safe and suitable for inclusion in supply chain contexts.",
