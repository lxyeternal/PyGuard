{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting asynchronous operations and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "URL parsing in parse_proxy_url, input parameters for proxy and connection details, environment variables are not explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection, socket.connect - establishing network connections; potentially handling untrusted proxy URLs.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing and validation → socket wrapper creation → connection initiation via sock.connect or loop.create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. Uses standard libraries and third-party packages as intended. No suspicious data leaks or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection setup. It securely parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and establishes network connections via asyncio, with proper error handling. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code handles untrusted inputs only for network connection setup, with no evidence of hidden behaviors or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
