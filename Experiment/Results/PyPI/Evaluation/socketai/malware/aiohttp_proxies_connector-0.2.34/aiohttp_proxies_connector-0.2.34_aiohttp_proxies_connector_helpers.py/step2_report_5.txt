  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, correctness of the assessments, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code provides functions to establish asynchronous network connections via SOCKS proxies.\n- It includes URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection establishment.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- It relies on standard libraries and third-party modules for proxy handling.\n- Error handling appears appropriate, validating inputs and raising exceptions as needed.\n- The logic flow is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified as proxy connection setup code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 — consistent and reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; securityRisk=0.2 seems slightly high but still low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, only a slightly elevated security risk score, perhaps reflecting general caution.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; securityRisk=0.1 is very low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior, standard code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; securityRisk=0.2 is acceptable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; securityRisk=0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), generally low, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, considering the code handles network connections securely and transparently.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no supply chain security issues or malicious activity. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of how this code is integrated into a larger system. If used with untrusted URLs or in an environment where proxy URLs are user-controlled, the potential for misuse exists, but this snippet alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
