{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting URL parsing and socket management.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy URLs, host and port inputs, and optional credentials from parameters and URL components.",
  "sinks": "Uses parsed credentials, proxy URL components, and socket objects to establish network connections; potential for data transmission over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Parses proxy URLs and credentials from input -> creates socket wrappers with credentials -> establishes connections through socks proxies -> returns network streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code structure appears standard; no obfuscated language features or misleading variables; error handling is conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates network connection creation via SOCKS proxies, parsing user-provided proxy URLs and credentials. It correctly distinguishes proxy types and manages socket connections. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors is evident. The handling of credentials is limited to use in socket connections and does not involve storage or transmission beyond the intended connection setup. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent detected. It adheres to common patterns for secure connection handling, with no evidence of malware or security risks beyond typical connection procedures.",
