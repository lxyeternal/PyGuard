{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, primarily for establishing network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL in parse_proxy_url(); reading function parameters such as socks_url, host, port, username, password, loop, and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers with create_socket_wrapper(); connecting sockets with sock.connect(); creating connections with asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection().",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() extracts proxy details from URL -> create_socket_wrapper() creates socket based on proxy type -> connect() establishes connection to proxy -> open_connection() or create_connection() establish the final network connection via the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of eval, exec, or other code execution; no suspicious domain or IP usage; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns; error handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles proxy connection setup, parsing URLs, and establishing connections asynchronously. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests intended functionality. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity observed. The code performs proxy handling and connection management securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections in Python. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module. It is focused on connection handling with appropriate error handling and input validation.",
