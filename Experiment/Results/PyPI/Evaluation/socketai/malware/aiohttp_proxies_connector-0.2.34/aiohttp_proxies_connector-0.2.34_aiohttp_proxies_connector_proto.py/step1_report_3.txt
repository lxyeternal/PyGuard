{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connections through proxy servers with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user_id; performs DNS resolution via getaddrinfo; receives data from network sockets; and processes responses from proxy servers.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions, particularly sock_sendall and sock_recv, which transmit and receive potentially untrusted network data; use of socket.inet_aton, inet_ntoa, inet_pton, and inet_ntop for IP address processing; data encoding for username, password, and host information.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into DNS resolution and proxy negotiation functions; data sent via sock_sendall to proxy server; responses received via sock_recv; the flow from inputs to network communications and responses forms the core data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; code appears to handle IP and hostname resolution properly; the dynamic building of requests and handling of responses aligns with protocol specifications. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected; the code performs expected proxy negotiation functions. Exception handling correctly closes sockets on errors, reducing risk of resource leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio. It manages socket connections, address resolution, and proxy negotiation following standard protocols. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The only potentially sensitive data handled are user credentials, but these are not hardcoded and are used only for authentication. The code does not perform any network communication outside the proxy negotiation process. There are no indications of malicious behavior, command execution, or covert data leakage. The structure and logic follow standard protocol implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no observable malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs expected functions related to proxy connection and authentication without any signs of sabotage or malware. Overall security risk is minimal.",
