  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication through proxies.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, destination address resolution, credential inputs for SOCKS5 authentication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; address resolution functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into connection and authentication routines, leading to socket communication with proxy server and destination.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows detected. No obfuscation or covert channels present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols with proper error handling, address resolution, and authentication. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The credential handling is appropriate and not hardcoded. Network operations follow best practices, and the overall structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments.",
