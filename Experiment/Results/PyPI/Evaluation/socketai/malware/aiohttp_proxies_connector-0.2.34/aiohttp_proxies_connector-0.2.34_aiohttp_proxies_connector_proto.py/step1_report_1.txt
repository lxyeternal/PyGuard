{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, handling connection, negotiation, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from user parameters (host, port, username, password), and network socket reads/writes during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network sockets, including proxy negotiation requests and authentication data; receives data from network sockets, including server responses and address info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → socket connection → SOCKS negotiation (authentication, address request) → data transfer over established socket connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident. The code uses standard asyncio and socket libraries. No obfuscated or malware-like behavior detected. The code handles errors properly and does not execute untrusted code or external commands.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation for SOCKS proxy handling with proper error checking, address resolution, and support for both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It performs network connections asynchronously, resolving host addresses either locally or remotely, and manages proxy authentication. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The handling of socket connections and data transmission appears standard and secure. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or malicious data leakage are identified. Overall, this seems like a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with appropriate error handling and network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection wrappers with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages network communication, authentication, and address resolution, following expected protocols. No malicious or sabotage signals are detected.",
