{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous wrapper for connecting through various proxy types (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP/HTTPS), including negotiation and data transmission.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input for hostnames, ports, and optional credentials; socket address resolution; network communication via sock_recv and sock_sendall.",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, sending and receiving data through sockets, potentially including sensitive data like hostnames, ports, and credentials.",
  "flows": "Input sources (host, port, credentials) flow into proxy negotiation and connection functions, which transmit data to proxy servers. Responses from proxies are processed and may influence further network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evidence of backdoors, code injection, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and patterns. No suspicious domain connections or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy connection procedures for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including address resolution, authentication, and connection setup. It employs asyncio for asynchronous operations and handles common exceptions securely. No signs of malicious activity or suspicious data handling are observed. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns. No embedded hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. It strictly adheres to proxy communication protocols without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous proxy connection wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs expected operations for a network proxy client module.",
