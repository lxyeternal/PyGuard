  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes the code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate, following standard protocols. The low risk score aligns with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no malicious signs, and proper handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Slightly higher risk score than Report 1 perhaps due to the use of external libraries (uvloop), but still minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, and proper exception handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior, proper error handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirms legitimate SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code being a standard, well-understood implementation of SOCKS proxies. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, which is reasonable considering the code handles sensitive data (credentials), but they are not hardcoded or misused.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Proper error handling and protocol adherence.\n- No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to handling credentials and network operations, but no actual security flaws or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, legitimate, and well-implemented.",
