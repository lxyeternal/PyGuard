{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to facilitate network connections through proxies in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and data from socket operations; address resolution functions; input parameters for connection requests.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over socket connections, especially during negotiation and authentication; address resolution functions that could potentially leak hostnames or IPs.",
  "flows": "Input data such as hostnames and credentials flow into socket connection and authentication procedures; data flows from inputs into socket send/receive operations; resolution data flows into request construction for proxy negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external libraries (uvloop) without clear necessity; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; error handling appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for proxy connection management, including authentication, address resolution, and connection establishment. No signs of malicious intent, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert communications, are evident. There is proper error handling, and no suspicious code or obfuscated logic is present. The code relies on well-understood socket and asyncio functions, with no indications of malicious data manipulation or covert channels. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. Overall, this seems to be a legitimate implementation of proxy socket wrappers intended for network routing through SOCKS proxies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles network proxy negotiations securely and properly, with appropriate error handling and no suspicious activity. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or data leaks, indicating low risk.",
