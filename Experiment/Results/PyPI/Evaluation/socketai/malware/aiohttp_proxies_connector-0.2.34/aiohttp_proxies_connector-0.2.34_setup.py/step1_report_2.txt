{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package, read version info, and execute potentially obfuscated code stored in encoded files, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USERPROFILE), reading the '__init__.py' for version info, and base64-encoded files ('main.cpython-39.py', 'scripts.cpython-39.py') written to disk.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded Python code via Popen, reading environment variables, and writing debug/error files; potential network connections through imported modules and subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> base64 decoding functions -> writing decoded scripts to disk -> executing scripts with subprocess -> potential network or system manipulation via decoded scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of base64 encoding and decoding, writing multiple decoded scripts to disk, dynamic execution, decoding code with obfuscated/encoded content, creation of temporary directories and files, and execution via hidden or background processes.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and reading package version info from a file, then performs environment checks and setups directories in TEMP folder. It has functions for base64 decoding, which decode two large scripts ('main' and 'scripts') stored as encoded strings. These scripts are written to disk as Python files and then executed in background processes, likely to load further malicious code. The code is heavily obfuscated through base64 encoding and dynamic writing/execution, with no clear user-facing functionality. It appears designed to run obfuscated code without user awareness, possibly to implement a backdoor, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The presence of commented-out code, background process execution, and obfuscation techniques further suggest malicious intent. The code’s structure indicates it aims to dynamically decode and run hidden payloads, typical of malware or malicious supply chain components.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear signs of obfuscation and malicious intent, primarily through the decoding and execution of encoded scripts in the TEMP directory, which are then run in background processes. This pattern strongly indicates malicious behavior such as backdoors or data theft. The use of environment variables, background execution, and obfuscation techniques all point toward this being malicious malware or sabotage, rather than legitimate functionality.",
