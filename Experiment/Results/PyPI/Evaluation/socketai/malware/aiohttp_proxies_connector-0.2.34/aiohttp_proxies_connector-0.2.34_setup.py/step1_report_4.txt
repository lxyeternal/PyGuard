    "Writing logs and DEBUG files in TEMP directory"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python environment, dynamically decodes and writes scripts from Base64 strings, then executes those scripts using subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which can run arbitrary shell commands or malicious scripts. The decoded scripts contain code that can perform network operations, file manipulations, or execute further obfuscated code. The code’s obfuscation, dynamic execution, and interaction with system directories and environment variables indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent. The code’s structure suggests it could be part of a malicious payload or backdoor, especially considering its heavy obfuscation, use of external script execution, and writing logs that could contain sensitive data or execution traces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to heavy obfuscation, dynamic execution of external scripts, and use of shell=True in subprocess, which significantly raises the risk of malicious behavior. It may be part of a backdoor, payload, or malware that performs unauthorized system or network actions. Caution is strongly advised against using this package.",
