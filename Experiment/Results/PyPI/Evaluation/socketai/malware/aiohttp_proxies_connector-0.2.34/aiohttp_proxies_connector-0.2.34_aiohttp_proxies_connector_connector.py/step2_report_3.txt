  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code does not contain any malware or obfuscation. The security risk is low, mainly due to potential misconfiguration if user inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present. The reasoning is sound, and the logic aligns with typical proxy implementations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Defines custom proxy classes, including a no-resolver bypassing DNS resolution. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The use of `NoResolver` is notable but not malicious. Proxy URL construction from user inputs is standard, with no evidence of malicious intent. The potential security concern is handling untrusted inputs, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Implements a proxy connector supporting different proxy types, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. Proxy URL formation and socket handling are standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Defines classes for proxy handling, including a no-resolver, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Proxy configuration is handled via parameters, with no hardcoded secrets.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connector with socket wrapping, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code manages proxy URLs and socket connections securely, assuming helper functions are safe. No malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code snippets indicate any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The use of socket wrappers and URL construction is typical for proxy implementations.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** The primary concern is handling user inputs (host, port, credentials). If inputs are malicious, they could lead to security issues such as credential leakage or misconfiguration. However, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Scores Justification:** Given the above, **malware score should be 0** across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity. The **obfuscated score remains 0**. The **security risk score** could be slightly higher if considering potential misconfiguration or input mishandling, but as per the reports, 0.1-0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1-0.2, reflecting standard proxy handling risks but no active threats.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (low, primarily due to input handling considerations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious intent or behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the malware score should be adjusted downward to 0.",
