  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and the reasoning provided, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector, no malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, straightforward URL and socket handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, typical implementation, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Custom proxy classes with DNS bypass, dynamic URL construction, socket wrapper, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, standard practices, the bypass resolver is notable but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The use of a no-resolver could be misused if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connector with flexible configuration, no malicious intent, standard URL and socket handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, proper parameter handling, standard practices.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy classes with optional DNS resolution, standard URL formation, no backdoors or secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, no anomalies, typical async handling.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connector with socket wrapping, URL handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Proper handling, no suspicious patterns, standard implementation.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports or the code snippets suggest any malicious activity. The socket wrapper and URL handling are standard for proxy implementations.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques are present.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only slight concern is the use of a no-resolver or dynamic URL construction, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (or slightly higher if considering potential misuse, but current seems reasonable)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
