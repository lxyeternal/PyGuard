{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for customizing proxy connection handling in HTTP clients, including a no-resolver option and a proxy connector supporting different proxy types and configurations.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as host, port, username, password, and URL parsing in from_url; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include URL formation for proxy configuration and socket connection creation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) to URL construction and socket connection setup; proxy URL is built from user input and then used in network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard for proxy handling and connection wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code implements proxy configuration and connection management with an option for DNS resolution control. Proxy URL formation uses user-provided parameters without hardcoded secrets. Connection handling differentiates based on proxy type, and no suspicious network behavior or obfuscated code is present. The use of async functions and socket wrappers is standard for asynchronous network operations. No indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP proxy connector with customizable options, and no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
