{
  "purpose": "Execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload during package setup if 'tahg' directory is missing, likely for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Check for existence of 'tahg' directory; execute subprocess with encoded PowerShell command when absent.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, potentially leading to remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Directory check (source) triggers subprocess call (sink) executing obfuscated payload, with no validation or decoding in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent execution with hidden window flags, suppression of errors, presence of suspicious URL comment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check, and if missing, runs an obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64 via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The command is designed to run silently, with no error handling, and is accompanied by a suspicious URL comment. The pattern indicates an attempt to execute malicious payloads stealthily during package installation, characteristic of supply chain attacks or backdoors. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent, with high potential for system compromise or remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating malicious behavior. The pattern aligns with known malware tactics, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The package should be flagged and further analyzed before use.",
