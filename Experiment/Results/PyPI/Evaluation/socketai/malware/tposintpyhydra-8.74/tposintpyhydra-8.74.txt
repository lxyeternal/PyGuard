      "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup, with a suspicious URL embedded. The activity strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The scores from reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0.9, obfuscated score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.9, reflecting high confidence in malicious behavior. The package should be considered malicious and avoided in production environments."
