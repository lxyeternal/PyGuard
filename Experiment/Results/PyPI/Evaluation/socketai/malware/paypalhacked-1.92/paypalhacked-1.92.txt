      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, combined with a suspicious package name and hidden execution flags. The broad exception handling masks errors, increasing the risk. Scores assigned in reports are consistent with these findings, indicating a high probability of malicious activity."
