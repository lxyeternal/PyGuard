  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The behavior suggests potential remote code execution or payload download, warranting caution. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify a malware score around 0.8, with high security risk. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for definitive analysis."
