  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statements and package setup configuration, including package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process input or data streams.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code appears minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines a version string, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include common libraries: 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The lack of author information is unusual but not suspicious in itself. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious, and there are no signs of sabotage or malware.",
