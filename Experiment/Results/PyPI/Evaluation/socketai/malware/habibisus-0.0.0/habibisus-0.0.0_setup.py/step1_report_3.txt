{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package named 'habibisus' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and 'install_requires' list indicating dependencies; the import statement for 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies could potentially include malicious packages; no direct sinks in the setup code itself.",
  "flows": "Import statement -> setup configuration -> installation of dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools. It specifies the package name, author details (empty), and dependencies required for installation. No user input, no network operations, no code execution, and no embedded malicious code. The dependencies listed ('browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests') are popular Python packages; however, their presence alone does not imply malicious intent. The script does not perform any runtime operations or data handling beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic suggests a benign configuration.",
