{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'habibisus' including its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, author info (empty), and the list of required dependencies from the 'install_requires' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed, but no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are directly apparent in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration does not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; it merely declares dependencies and package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Author and author_email fields are empty, which may be unusual but not inherently malicious. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. While some of these libraries can be used for legitimate automation or data access, they could also be exploited maliciously for data scraping or command-and-control activities if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package with specified dependencies. No code execution, user input handling, or dynamic behavior is present. The listed dependencies include libraries that can be used for web requests, cookie access, Discord webhooks, and Roblox interactions—potentially for automation, data collection, or messaging. The absence of author information could suggest minimal identification, which is mildly unusual but not suspicious per se. Overall, the code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. Given the limited context, no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup without any evident malicious behavior or security risks. The dependencies listed could be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but this snippet alone appears benign.",
