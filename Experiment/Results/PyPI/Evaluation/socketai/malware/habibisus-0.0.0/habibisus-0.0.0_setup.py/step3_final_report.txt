  "purpose": "A minimal Python package setup script defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package list and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in dependencies if misused elsewhere, but none in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow indicating malicious activity; standard package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author fields, but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with common dependencies. No code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The dependencies could be misused in other contexts, but the script itself is benign. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or obfuscated code, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by potential misuse of dependencies but no actual threat. Confidence scores are high (0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the dependencies' potential misuse but no malicious activity in this code. All reports are consistent and accurate.",
