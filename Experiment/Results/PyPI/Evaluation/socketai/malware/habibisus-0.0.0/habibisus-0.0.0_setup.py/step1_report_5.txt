{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'habibisus' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it mainly sources data from the environment for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code only sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The author, author_email are empty strings; no sensitive information is hardcoded. The package name and dependencies are standard, with no suspicious dependencies. No obfuscated or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. No malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution, is present. The dependencies are common for automation or bot functionalities, but their presence alone does not imply malicious intent. The lack of sensitive information or suspicious patterns indicates no malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be a benign setup configuration.",
