{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'habibisus' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' and the package metadata (name, author, email).",
  "sinks": "Dependencies like 'requests', 'browser_cookie3', and 'discordwebhook' could potentially be used to send data over the network or interact with external services.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are installed, potentially enabling network communication; no direct data flow or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "Author and author_email are empty, which may be unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup with minimal logic. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies are common libraries that can perform network requests and browser cookie access, which could be used maliciously if misused, but this code does not explicitly do so. No input/output data handling or code injection observed. The code appears standard for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no direct malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The dependencies could be used maliciously in other contexts, but this script itself is benign.",
