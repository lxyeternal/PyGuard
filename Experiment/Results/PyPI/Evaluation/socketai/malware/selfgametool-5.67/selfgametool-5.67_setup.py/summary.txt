  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The suspicious URL comment and silent error handling support this. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate. The package should be treated as malicious pending further decoding of the PowerShell payload."
