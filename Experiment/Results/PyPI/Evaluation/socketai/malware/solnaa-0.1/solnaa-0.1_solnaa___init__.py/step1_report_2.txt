  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to implementing a Python package that performs certain functionalities, possibly involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data can be read from environment variables, user inputs, or external files/readers within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or similar modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system commands), passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code detected. Unusual use of dynamic execution or obfuscation patterns absent. No evident backdoors or malicious API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks with typical Python libraries. No malicious or maliciously-intentional code patterns identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No signs of data exfiltration, suspicious network activity, or system manipulation. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated segments or suspicious constructs. Careful review of all data handling paths shows no anomalies or malicious flows.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate Python module with standard operations. The overall security risk is low, and there are no suspicious source-to-sink flows detected.",
