{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system command.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of a system command which could run arbitrary code or scripts",
  "flows": "No untrusted data input is evident; the code unconditionally executes a fixed command",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system to execute a hardcoded command; no user input or environment variables influence this execution",
  "analysis": "The script imports the os module and defines a main() function that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. Since the command is hardcoded and does not incorporate user input or environment variables, there are no direct indications of malicious data injection. However, executing external scripts via os.system can be risky if 'my_script.py' is compromised or malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads in this fragment. The code appears straightforward and intended to run another script.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply runs a specific Python script using a system call. There is no evidence of malicious intent within this code snippet itself, but executing external scripts always carries risk if the external script is malicious or compromised. Overall, this code is low risk but should be reviewed in the context of 'my_script.py'.",
