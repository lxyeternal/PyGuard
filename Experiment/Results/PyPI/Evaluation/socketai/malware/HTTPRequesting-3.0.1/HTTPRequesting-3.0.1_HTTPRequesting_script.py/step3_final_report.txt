  "purpose": "Executes 'my_script.py' via system shell.",
  "sources": "Fixed string command in os.system call.",
  "sinks": "os.system execution of external command.",
  "flows": "Static command string executed directly; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines main() which calls os.system with a fixed command, and runs main() if script is executed directly. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic command construction are present. The code is simple, clear, and does not contain malicious logic or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of os.system, which is generally discouraged, but in this context, the command is static and not influenced by untrusted input. The potential risk depends on the external script 'my_script.py', which is outside the scope of this code. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The use of os.system is a security anti-pattern but does not imply malicious intent here. Overall, the code poses low risk and no malware threat.",
