{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system's command interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no user input or external data sources explicitly; it relies on the environment and the script being executed.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call is a sink that executes a command ('python my_script.py') which could run any arbitrary code if 'my_script.py' is malicious.",
  "flows": "No direct flow of untrusted input to sensitive functions; the main flow is invoking an external script via the system shell.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system with a fixed string, which can be risky if the string were dynamically constructed. No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main function that calls os.system to execute 'python my_script.py'. The script relies on the external script's content, which could be malicious. The code itself does not contain malicious logic but can be used as a vector to run malicious scripts. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated parts. The code's simplicity means its malicious potential depends entirely on the content of 'my_script.py'.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal launcher for executing an external Python script. It does not contain malicious code itself but could facilitate execution of malicious scripts if 'my_script.py' is compromised. Its security risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external script. The code itself is benign but potentially dangerous in context.",
