{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external script 'my_script.py' using the system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "The os.system call, which executes a command in the system shell with potentially untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input (via command string) flows directly into the system shell execution, which can be exploited if the command string is influenced by untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. It simply runs another script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and defines a main function that calls os.system with a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. There are no user inputs or external data sources involved within this snippet. The use of os.system is potentially dangerous if the command string were dynamic or influenced by untrusted input, but here it is a static string. The script does not perform any other suspicious or malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or file manipulation beyond executing another script.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply runs a script named 'my_script.py' using a system call. On its own, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or contain malware. However, reliance on os.system can be risky if modified to accept untrusted input. In its current form, it appears benign.",
