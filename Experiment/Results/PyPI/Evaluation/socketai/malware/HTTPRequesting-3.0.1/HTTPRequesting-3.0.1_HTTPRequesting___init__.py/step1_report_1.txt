  "purpose": "Execute another Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system shell.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system('python my_script.py') that executes an external script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of an external script via os.system, which can be exploited if the command string is manipulated or if 'my_script.py' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded command string) flows into the system shell execution, potentially leading to code execution or malicious actions if 'my_script.py' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly invokes os.system with a fixed string, which could be risky if the string were constructed dynamically. No input validation or sanitization is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. There are no user inputs or dynamic commands; the command is hardcoded. While this in itself is not malicious, the use of os.system with fixed commands can be dangerous if expanded or modified. The script itself does not contain malicious code or obfuscated logic, but it provides a mechanism to run external scripts, which can be exploited if 'my_script.py' is malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of input handling reduce immediate risk but could be dangerous in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external script via a system call, which can be risky if the external script is malicious or if the command string is manipulated. Currently, no malicious behavior is evident, but the pattern of executing external scripts warrants caution. Overall, low risk but potential security concern if used improperly.",
