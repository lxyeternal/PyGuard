{
  "purpose": "The script executes another Python script named 'my_script.py' using a system call.",
  "sources": "os.system() call executing 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of an external script via os.system() which can run arbitrary code",
  "flows": "Input (script invocation) flows from the script to the system shell, executing 'my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() with a fixed command string; no user input sanitization or dynamic input, which could be risky if modified but currently static",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main() function that calls os.system() to execute 'python my_script.py'. Since the command is hardcoded and does not involve user input, there is no immediate evidence of malicious intent. However, executing external scripts can be dangerous if 'my_script.py' contains malicious code or if the command is manipulated in a different context. The script is simple and does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Its security risk is minimal but should be reviewed in the context of what 'my_script.py' does.",
  "conclusion": "The script's behavior is straightforward: it runs an external script. There is no indication of malicious intent within this code itself, but executing external scripts always carries some risk if the external script is malicious or compromised. No obfuscation or malware signs are present.",
