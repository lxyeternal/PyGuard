{
  "purpose": "The code executes a fixed external script 'my_script.py' using os.system(), serving to run that script during execution.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system('python my_script.py') is the primary source of data execution, with no user input or dynamic data involved.",
  "sinks": "The external script 'my_script.py' is invoked, which could potentially perform malicious actions if compromised, representing a sink for malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: the main() function calls os.system() with a static command, leading directly to executing 'my_script.py'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, dynamic command construction, or hidden code are present; the code is simple and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines main() which executes a fixed command via os.system(), and runs main() if executed as the main module. It does not accept input or perform any complex operations. The security concern is external: if 'my_script.py' is malicious, executing it could be harmful. The code itself is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2-0.4), reflecting potential danger if the external script is compromised. The reports correctly identify these aspects, and their scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and not malicious; the main security risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low to moderate risk score due to external script execution. No significant issues are present, but external script validation is recommended.",
