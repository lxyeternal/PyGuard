{
  "purpose": "The code runs an external script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it relies on the execution environment and a hardcoded command within os.system().",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a hardcoded command, which could run arbitrary scripts or commands, potentially leading to malicious actions if 'my_script.py' is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: upon execution, it calls os.system() to run 'python my_script.py'. No data flows from external sources into this script are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with a hardcoded script name poses a security risk if 'my_script.py' is malicious or tampered with; no validation or sanitization occurs.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, executing a Python script via os.system(). The code does not accept external input, but the reliance on an external script ('my_script.py') introduces risk if that script is malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. The usage of os.system() is a potential security concern because it can execute arbitrary commands if modified or if 'my_script.py' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple and not inherently malicious, but it poses a security risk due to executing an external script without validation. The overall malicious potential depends on the content and trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'.",
