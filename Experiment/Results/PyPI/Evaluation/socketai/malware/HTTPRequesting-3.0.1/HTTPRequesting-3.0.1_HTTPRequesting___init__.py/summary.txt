  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and not malicious; the main security risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low to moderate risk score due to external script execution. No significant issues are present, but external script validation is recommended."
