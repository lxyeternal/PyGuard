{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes a remote Python script.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' is used as a source for the remote script. The package metadata and dependencies are also sources.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded 'ratfinal.py' script is executed with subprocess, which could run malicious code without further checks.",
  "flows": "The code fetches remote code from the URL (source), writes it to a file, and then executes it (sink), creating a direct source-to-sink flow that can execute malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The installation process intentionally downloads and executes code from an external URL during setup, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior for a benign package. No validation or security checks are performed on the downloaded script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and install commands from setuptools, and defines a custom installation command. During installation, it fetches a Python script from a Discord CDN URL, saves it locally, and executes it immediately. This behavior can be exploited for malicious activities such as remote code execution, backdooring, or data exfiltration. The package metadata appears legitimate, but the dynamic remote code execution during setup is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation. The act of executing code from an external source without validation is a significant security risk, indicating potential malware or backdoor behavior.",
