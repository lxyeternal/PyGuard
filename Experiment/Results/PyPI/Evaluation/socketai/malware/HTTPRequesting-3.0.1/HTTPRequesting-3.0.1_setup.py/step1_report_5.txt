{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'HTTPRequesting' and includes a custom installation step that downloads and executes a remote Python script.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' is used as a source to fetch external code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'ratfinal.py'])' executes the downloaded script, potentially allowing remote code execution.",
  "flows": "The code fetches external code via requests.get(), saves it locally, and then runs it directly with subprocess, creating a source-to-sink flow from remote URL to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically downloads and executes a remote Python script during installation without any verification, which is highly unusual and suspicious. Use of Discord CDN for hosting malicious payloads is also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that downloads a Python script from an external URL and executes it during installation. This behavior bypasses typical package security checks and could allow remote code execution. The URL used is a Discord CDN link, commonly exploited to host malicious payloads. The code does not validate or verify the fetched content, increasing the risk of executing malicious code. The inclusion of requests and subprocess for this purpose indicates malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior. There are no other obfuscations or suspicious code patterns besides this network activity and execution step.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious pattern: it downloads and executes remote code during package installation, which can lead to arbitrary remote code execution. The behavior strongly indicates malicious intent or compromise, making this package unsafe for use.",
