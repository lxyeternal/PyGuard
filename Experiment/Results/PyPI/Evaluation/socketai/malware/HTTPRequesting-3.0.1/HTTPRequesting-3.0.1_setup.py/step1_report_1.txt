{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes a remote Python script.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py' during the run method of CustomInstallCommand, which is executed on install.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'ratfinal.py']).",
  "flows": "The code fetches remote content from the URL and then directly executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow from network download to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically downloads and executes code from an external source without verification or user consent. The URL appears suspicious, hosting a Python script named 'ratfinal.py', which suggests possible remote code execution or malware behavior.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, during installation, downloads a Python script from a remote URL. It then immediately executes this script using subprocess. This behavior is highly suspicious because it introduces untrusted external code into the system during package installation, which can lead to malicious actions such as system compromise, data theft, or backdoor installation. The use of a Discord CDN URL is unconventional and potentially malicious. The rest of the code (package metadata, dependencies) appears standard and unrelated to the malicious activity. The key concern is the automatic download and execution of external code without validation, posing a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, representing a severe security risk. This behavior strongly indicates an attempt to compromise systems through malicious package distribution.",
