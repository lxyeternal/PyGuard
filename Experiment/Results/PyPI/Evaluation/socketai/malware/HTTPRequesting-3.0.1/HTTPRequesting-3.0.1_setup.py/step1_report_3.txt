{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom installation process that downloads and executes an external Python script from a Discord URL during installation.",
  "sources": "requests.get() retrieves external Python code from a Discord URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executes the downloaded code, potentially running malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches the external script -> writes it to 'ratfinal.py' -> subprocess.check_call() runs the downloaded script.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing code from a third-party URL during installation, especially from a Discord CDN, is highly unusual and suspicious. No verification or validation of downloaded code is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, downloads a Python script from a Discord URL and immediately executes it. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution at install time, which can be malicious. The external script 'ratfinal.py' is fetched directly and executed without any verification, integrity check, or user consent. The setup packages dependencies, but the core concern is the dynamic remote code execution embedded within the installation process, a common tactic for supply chain attacks or malware distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, which poses a high security risk. The design indicates intent to run potentially harmful code without user awareness or verification. The overall security risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
