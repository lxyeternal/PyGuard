{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote Python script from a Discord CDN URL during installation and executes it immediately, without validation or user consent.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call fetching the script from the URL; the URL itself; the open() function writing 'ratfinal.py'.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'ratfinal.py']) executing the downloaded script; the script execution as a subprocess.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the script from the URL, writes it to 'ratfinal.py', then subprocess.check_call executes it with the Python interpreter.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation; use of Discord CDN for hosting potentially malicious payload; no checksum or validation steps; filename 'ratfinal.py' suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly performs a remote code download and execution during setup, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. The URL is hosted on Discord, a platform often exploited for hosting malicious payloads. The code lacks validation, checksum verification, or user confirmation, increasing the risk of executing arbitrary malicious code. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks or malware distribution. The malware score is justified as 1, given the active remote code execution. The security risk score is also 1, reflecting the high severity of this behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, so the obfuscated score remains 0. The confidence in this assessment is high, close to 1, due to the clear pattern of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation, representing a severe security threat. The scores of malware: 1, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 1 are justified and consistent with the behavior. This package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it.",
