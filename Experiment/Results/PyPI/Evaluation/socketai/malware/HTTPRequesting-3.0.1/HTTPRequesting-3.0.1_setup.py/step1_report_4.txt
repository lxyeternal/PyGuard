{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'HTTPRequesting' with specific dependencies and a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads an external URL to download 'ratfinal.py' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded 'ratfinal.py' is executed immediately after download, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code fetches 'ratfinal.py' from the internet (source), writes it to disk, then executes it (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing code from an external URL during package installation is highly unusual and suspicious. No validation or integrity checks are performed on the downloaded script. The URL points to a Discord CDN, often used for hosting malicious payloads. The code includes no user confirmation or validation steps before executing remote code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, downloads a Python script from a Discord CDN link. It then executes this script immediately using subprocess, bypassing any verification or security checks. This behavior can be exploited to run malicious code on any system installing this package. The use of 'requests' for fetching and 'subprocess' for executing external code signifies a high security risk. There are no safeguards such as checksum validation, authentication, or user prompts. The package's main purpose appears legitimate on the surface, but the dynamic code execution introduces a critical security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation. The code can run arbitrary, potentially harmful scripts without user consent or verification, posing a severe security threat.",
