      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation, representing a severe security threat. The scores of malware: 1, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 1 are justified and consistent with the behavior. This package should be flagged as malicious, and users should avoid installing it."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and not malicious; the main security risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low to moderate risk score due to external script execution. No significant issues are present, but external script validation is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The use of os.system is a security anti-pattern but does not imply malicious intent here. Overall, the code poses low risk and no malware threat."
