  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload conditioned on filesystem state. The silent error handling and embedded URL further support this. The scores across reports are consistent and justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms otherwise."
