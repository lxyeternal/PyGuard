  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious payload hidden behind obfuscation and silent execution tactics. The embedded PowerShell command, combined with suspicious comments and conditional logic, suggests active malicious intent. The package should be flagged as dangerous, and the payload warrants further decoding and analysis."
