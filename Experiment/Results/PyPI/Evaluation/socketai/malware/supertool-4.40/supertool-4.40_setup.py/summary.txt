  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The high obfuscation and risk scores are justified, and the package should be treated with suspicion pending further analysis of the encoded payload."
