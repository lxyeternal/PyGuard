  "purpose": "Simple function to print a greeting message",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading observed",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output beyond standard print",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'EOF' after the function definition, which is invalid Python syntax; no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that outputs a greeting. The 'EOF' line appears to be extraneous or an artifact outside the Python code context, possibly an attempt at obfuscation or an invalid syntax. The core code is benign, with no suspicious behavior. No input sources, data leaks, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with an invalid line 'EOF' that does not impact execution but indicates potential formatting issues. No malware or security concerns detected.",
