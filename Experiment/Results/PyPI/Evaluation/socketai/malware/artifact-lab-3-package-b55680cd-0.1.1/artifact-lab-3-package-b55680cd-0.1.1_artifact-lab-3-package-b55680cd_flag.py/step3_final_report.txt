{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'Hello, World!'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the function does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function call (if invoked) would flow from the function definition to the print statement; no external flows or data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The extraneous 'EOF' line outside the function is an invalid syntax in Python, likely a formatting artifact or copying error, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The core code is a benign, straightforward function that prints a static message. The 'EOF' line outside the function is invalid in Python but does not impact execution if ignored or considered a formatting artifact. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only anomaly is the 'EOF' line, which should be flagged as a formatting or syntax issue but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The extraneous 'EOF' line is a formatting artifact, not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
