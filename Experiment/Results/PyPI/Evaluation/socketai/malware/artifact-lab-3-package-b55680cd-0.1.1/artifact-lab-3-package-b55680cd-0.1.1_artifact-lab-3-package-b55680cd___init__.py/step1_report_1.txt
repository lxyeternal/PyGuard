  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but without the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user inputs, or external files/read operations. Since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writes, or system commands. Without code details, cannot specify exact sinks.",
  "flows": "Flow analysis cannot be performed without concrete code. Generally, source data would flow into processing functions and then to sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without seeing the code. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident in the provided prompt.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code data to analyze sources, sinks, or flows. Cannot determine malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues without code content.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Cannot determine malicious behavior or security risks. Please supply the code for a thorough analysis.",
