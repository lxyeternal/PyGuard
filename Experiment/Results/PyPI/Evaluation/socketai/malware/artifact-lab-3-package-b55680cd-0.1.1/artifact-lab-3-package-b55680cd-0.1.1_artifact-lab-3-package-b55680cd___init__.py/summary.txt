  "conclusion": "The evaluations are consistent and cautious, with no concrete malicious payloads identified. The moderate suspicion levels are justified based on described patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic code features. Minor score adjustment for report 3 improves alignment with the observed indicators. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, and no significant changes are necessary."
