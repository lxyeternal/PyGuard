{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that send environment data to a remote URL during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() reads environment variables and encodes them for transmission. It is called during both install and develop command execution.",
  "sinks": "The urllib.request.urlopen(req) sends data over the network to a specified external URL, potentially leaking environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are collected and encoded, then sent via HTTP POST request to an external URL (sink) during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits all environment variables unconditionally during installation/development, which is unusual and suspicious. The target URL appears obfuscated or maliciously chosen. No validation or user consent is involved.",
  "analysis": "The script defines setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It includes custom commands that, upon execution, invoke the notmalfunc() function. This function collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a remote URL via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates possible data exfiltration. The URL appears obfuscated or intentionally disguised. The code does not perform any validation, logging, or error handling for the network request. There is no legitimate reason to transmit environment variables during package setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation and development, likely for tracking or data theft purposes. The code’s purpose aligns with malicious supply chain activity, and it should be considered highly dangerous.",
