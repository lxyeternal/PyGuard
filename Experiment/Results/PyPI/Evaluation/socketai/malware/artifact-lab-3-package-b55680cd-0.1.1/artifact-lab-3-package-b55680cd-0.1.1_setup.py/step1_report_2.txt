  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes custom installation and development commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), URL request with encoded data (urllib.request).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to an external domain.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of code that sends environment data to an external server during package installation or development; hardcoded URL; no user consent or control over data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'notmalfunc' that collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via HTTP POST to a specific external URL. This function is invoked during both 'develop' and 'install' commands, meaning data transmission occurs during package setup. The URL is hardcoded, and the data sent is potentially sensitive environment information. No input validation or user consent is present. This behavior resembles data exfiltration without transparency, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes code that secretly transmits environment data to an external domain during installation and development, which is suspicious and likely malicious behavior. It can be used for tracking, information gathering, or malicious surveillance. The code is straightforward but exhibits privacy-invasive behavior.",
