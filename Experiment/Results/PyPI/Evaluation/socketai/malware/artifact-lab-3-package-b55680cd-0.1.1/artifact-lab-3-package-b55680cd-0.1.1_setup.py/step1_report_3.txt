{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs the package and attaches custom behaviors to the install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read in the 'notmalfunc()' function via 'os.environ'.",
  "sinks": "The collected environment data is URL-encoded and sent via HTTP POST request to an external URL ('http://8hqnqd3insnk7efz3iiokreih9n0brzg.oastify.com').",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are collected in 'notmalfunc()' -> URL-encoded -> sent as data in HTTP request (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The 'notmalfunc()' function, which exfiltrates environment data, is called during both package installation and development setup, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup utilities and defines functions for package installation. The key suspicious part is the 'notmalfunc()' function, which gathers all environment variables and sends them to an external server via an HTTP POST request. This function is invoked automatically during both the 'install' and 'develop' commands by overriding 'run' methods in custom command classes. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment information without user consent. There are no other malicious or suspicious code patterns, but the hidden data collection and transmission represent a security concern. The code does not perform any malicious actions on the local system itself, but it compromises user privacy and security by sending environment data externally.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly exfiltrates environment variables during package installation and development, which is malicious behavior related to data theft. The rest of the code appears normal for a setup script, but this hidden functionality is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent.",
