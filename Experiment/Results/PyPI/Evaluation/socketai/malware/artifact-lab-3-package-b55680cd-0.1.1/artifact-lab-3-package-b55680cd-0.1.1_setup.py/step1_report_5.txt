{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation and development commands that execute a function during installation and development.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() reads environment variables and encodes them for transmission.",
  "sinks": "The function sends data via an HTTP POST request to an external URL, transmitting environment data.",
  "flows": "The environment variables are read (source) in notmalfunc(), then encoded and sent to the specified URL (sink) during installation or development.",
  "anomalies": "The function notmalfunc() sends all environment variables to an external URL without user consent, which is suspicious. The URL appears obfuscated or malicious-looking. The code executes during standard install and develop commands, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without explicit consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules for package setup. It defines a function notmalfunc() that captures all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP request to a suspicious URL. Custom commands AfterDevelop and AfterInstall override the run() method to invoke notmalfunc() after normal install/develop processes. This behavior is unusual for package setup scripts and suggests potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The URL used appears intentionally obfuscated or suspicious. The code does not contain any obfuscated language features but performs an unauthorized network transmission during package setup, which is uncommon and concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data to an external server during package installation or development. It likely aims to gather environment details covertly. Due to the data transmission to a suspicious URL during standard setup procedures, this code poses a security risk and should be considered malicious.",
