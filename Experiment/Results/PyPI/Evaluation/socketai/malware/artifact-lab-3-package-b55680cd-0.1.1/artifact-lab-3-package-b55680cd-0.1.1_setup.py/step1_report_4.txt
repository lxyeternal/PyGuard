  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and defines custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), URL encoding (urllib.parse.urlencode), and executing custom functions during install/develop commands.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded environment data via HTTP POST request to external server (http://8hqnqd3insnk7efz3iiokreih9n0brzg.oastify.com).",
  "flows": "Custom install/develop run methods invoke 'notmalfunc()', which collects environment data, encodes it, and sends it over the network to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: code intentionally transmits environment variables to an external server during installation/development process; the URL appears suspicious and likely malicious or tracking in nature.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, but it includes custom commands that, upon installation or development setup, execute 'notmalfunc()'. This function collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via HTTP POST request to an external domain. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of environment data, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not sanitize data or provide user warnings. The external URL appears suspicious, and such behavior could be used for tracking, information harvesting, or malicious activity. The rest of the setup code appears normal and typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting environment variables and sending them to an external server during installation or development, indicating data exfiltration. This behavior is suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or information theft.",
