  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Provides utility functions to create SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- Parses proxy URLs, validates inputs.\n- Uses custom socket wrappers (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`) for proxy handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Functions perform standard network connection setup with validation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's purpose and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; network sockets and asyncio functions are involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to external input handling, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard socket connection handling.\n- Correctly notes that no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Confidence remains high, and scores are consistent.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on external inputs (proxy URLs, host, port).\n- Recognizes that malicious configuration could redirect traffic but notes this is a standard pattern.\n- No malicious activity detected; standard validation and socket creation.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar assessment: functions for proxy connection setup, standard practices.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence high, scores consistent.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly lower, reflecting minimal inherent risk)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- Summarizes the code as standard, with proper validation.\n- No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- Confident and consistent scoring.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Analysis & Final Estimation**\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to accepting external URLs and user inputs, which could be misused if configured maliciously, but this is typical for proxy utilities.\n\n**Considering all reports and the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No backdoors, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- External inputs could be misused but are not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n| Metric            | Score  | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0** | No malicious behavior or code detected.                         |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0** | Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation present.           |\n| **Risk**         | **0.2** | Slight risk due to external input handling, but standard for such utilities. |\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score could be marginally increased if considering the potential for misuse of user-provided URLs, but overall, the security posture is sound.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
