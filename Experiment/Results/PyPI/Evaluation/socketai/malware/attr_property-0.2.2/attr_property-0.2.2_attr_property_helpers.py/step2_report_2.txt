  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as a utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio, with proper URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection handling.\n- No report indicates any malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The code relies on external modules (`attr_property`, `yarl`) for URL parsing and socket wrappers, which are standard in such contexts.\n- The functions perform input validation and handle errors gracefully.\n- The malware scores are all zero, and the confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting that the reviewers see no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Code Functionality:** The code's purpose is to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, which is consistent across reports.\n- **Input Validation:** Checks for host and port presence, URL parsing, and proxy type validation are all standard and correctly implemented.\n- **Proxy URL Parsing:** Uses `parse_proxy_url`, which correctly extracts scheme, host, port, username, and password.\n- **Socket Wrappers:** Uses `Socks4SocketWrapper` and `Socks5SocketWrapper` based on proxy type, which is standard.\n- **Connection Establishment:** Uses `sock.connect()` and asyncio's connection functions properly.\n\n### Potential Concerns or Anomalies:\n\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.\n- External inputs (proxy URLs, host, port) are accepted but are typical for such utilities.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), mainly because accepting external proxy URLs could, in theory, be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this is standard for proxy utilities and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided reports' conclusions and scores. The code appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Scores and Reasoning:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Accepting external proxy URLs could be exploited if misused, but not a direct security flaw.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical implementation for SOCKS proxy connections with no evident security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and well-implemented for its purpose.",
