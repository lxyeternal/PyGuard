{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting URL parsing and socket wrapper creation.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function parsing URLs, open_connection and create_connection functions accepting proxy URLs, host, port, and credentials as input.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection where untrusted data (like host, port, proxy URL) influences connection parameters; socket connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input from proxy URL or host/port flows into create_socket_wrapper, then to socket connect, and finally to asyncio connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Proxy URL parsing is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. Proxy handling appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code securely parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers based on proxy type, and establishes network connections via asyncio. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network behavior, or malicious intent are evident. The code adheres to standard practices for asynchronous proxy connections. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. It functions as intended for proxy connection management without security risks.",
