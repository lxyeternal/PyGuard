  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections with asyncio. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk stems from accepting external URLs, which is inherent to proxy tools but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
