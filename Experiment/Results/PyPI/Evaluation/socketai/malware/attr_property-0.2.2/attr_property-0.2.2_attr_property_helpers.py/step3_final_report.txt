  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to create SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, environment variables (via asyncio event loop)",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, asyncio connection functions",
  "flows": "Parsing proxy URL -> creating socket wrapper -> connecting socket -> establishing asyncio connection",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of inputs, URL parsing, and socket creation for SOCKS proxies. It uses established libraries and custom socket wrappers without suspicious patterns. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External inputs are accepted but are typical for proxy utilities. The code's structure and logic are sound, with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections with asyncio. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk stems from accepting external URLs, which is inherent to proxy tools but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
