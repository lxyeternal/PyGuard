{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; code only defines exception classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present as this is only class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types related to SOCKS proxy errors. These are straightforward custom exception subclasses, inheriting from built-in exceptions such as Exception, OSError, and specific error types. There are no function calls, data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. This code appears to be part of a larger codebase handling SOCKS proxy operations and is not malicious on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It serves as a foundation for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context and does not pose any security risks by itself.",
