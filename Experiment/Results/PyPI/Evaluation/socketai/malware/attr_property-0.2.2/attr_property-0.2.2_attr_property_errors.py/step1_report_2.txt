  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; exception class definitions do not read input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations present; exception classes are used for error handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources or sinks; this code only defines exception types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of class definitions with no executable or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from base exception classes to handle various SOCKS proxy and authentication errors. No input/output, data processing, or malicious activity is present. The structure is straightforward, with class inheritance indicating organized error categorization. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are identified. The code appears purely for error management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected. It is a standard pattern for exception handling.",
