  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and malicious activity:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - No external data, network calls, or code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The class hierarchy is consistent and appropriate for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports, justified as no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk: 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behavior are present.\n   - Confidence: 1, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as exception definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** This code snippet is a standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. It’s a foundational part of error handling in a SOCKS proxy module and poses no threat on its own.",
