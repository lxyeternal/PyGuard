  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data processing; purely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; exceptions are defined but not used here.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations present.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy and general proxy errors. There are no operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The classes inherit from standard exception types and are used for error handling, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as error class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
