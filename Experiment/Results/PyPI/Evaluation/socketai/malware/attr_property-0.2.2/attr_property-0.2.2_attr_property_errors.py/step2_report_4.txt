  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no function calls, data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The analysis is thorough, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0 in one case)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is purely class definitions, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior; the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The exception classes are standard and benign.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as error class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment & Personal Estimation**:\n- The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- I agree with the provided scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, and the scores accurately reflect its benign nature.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis is a standard, non-malicious, error handling infrastructure code snippet.",
