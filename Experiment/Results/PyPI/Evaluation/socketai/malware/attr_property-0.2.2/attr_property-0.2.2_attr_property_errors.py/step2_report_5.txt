  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No input/output, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions, serving as error categorization.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - No evidence of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code appears to be a standard part of an error handling framework.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, any higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The reasoning in the reports is consistent and sound.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - No indication of code being used maliciously or in a way that could harm security.\n   - The purpose of these classes is standard error handling; no red flags.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- The code is simple, benign, and standard.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
