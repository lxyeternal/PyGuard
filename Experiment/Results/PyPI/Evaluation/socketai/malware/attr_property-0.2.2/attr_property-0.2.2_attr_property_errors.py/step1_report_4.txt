  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data processing in this code segment)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network calls, or external interactions)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks, as this is solely class definitions)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all classes are straightforward exception subclasses with no unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy contexts. These classes inherit from standard exceptions and do not contain executable code, data processing, or network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as error classification infrastructure, with no malicious intent or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a SOCKS proxy module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks within these definitions. The code is benign and purely structural.",
