  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no input/output operations, network calls, data processing, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of error classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate because the code is simple class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions with no executable or malicious content, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 align with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet. No changes are necessary.",
