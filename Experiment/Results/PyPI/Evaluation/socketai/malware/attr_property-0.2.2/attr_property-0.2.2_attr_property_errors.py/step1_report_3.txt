  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input reading; no external data sources; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or execution logic beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and general proxy errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes and serve as structured error types. There are no dynamic or external data interactions, no security-sensitive operations, and no signs of malicious intent. The code appears to be a straightforward, typical set of exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining custom exceptions for error handling related to SOCKS proxies and proxies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
