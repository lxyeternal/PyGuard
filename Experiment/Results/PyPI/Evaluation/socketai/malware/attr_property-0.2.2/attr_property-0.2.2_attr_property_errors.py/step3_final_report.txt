  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - only class declarations; no data flow or execution flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy-related exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or executable logic. The code is clear, well-structured, and standard for error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and confidence is high (1), reflecting the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
