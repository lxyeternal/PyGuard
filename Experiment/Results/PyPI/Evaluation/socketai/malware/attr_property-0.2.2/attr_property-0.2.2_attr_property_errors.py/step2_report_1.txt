  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward, standard class definitions.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description: only class definitions, no functional or malicious code.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident; the classes are correctly structured.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely structural.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports. This is appropriate.\n   - Security risk: 0 across all reports. Also appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - Confidence: 1, justified given the straightforward nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely structural and does not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The code is safe and standard.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n- No changes needed; the evaluation aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent. I agree with the reports' assessments and would maintain the scores as they are.",
