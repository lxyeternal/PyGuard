  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes standard proxy negotiation, with data flowing into socket send/recv functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, standard libraries, proper exception handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate proxy code, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; the code handles proxy negotiation as expected.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- Scores are reasonable.  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on address resolution and proxy negotiation.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, standard protocol handling, no obfuscation, no malicious indicators.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid implementation, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.  \n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Details about socket operations, credential handling, address resolution.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, standard protocol logic, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's functions.  \n- No malicious indicators.  \n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focus on socket communication, address resolution, and proxy negotiation.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no backdoors, standard network code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis correctly identifies standard proxy client behavior.  \n- No suspicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar proxy connection implementation, with standard socket handling.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns, proper exception handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's operations.  \n- No signs of malicious intent.  \n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asynchronous Python applications.  \n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk scores low) are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough review.\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical network code risk)  \n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy code)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
