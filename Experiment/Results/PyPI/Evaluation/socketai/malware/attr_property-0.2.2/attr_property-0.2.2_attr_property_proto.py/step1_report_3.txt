{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to facilitate proxy connections with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets via asyncio loop methods and from socket functions (e.g., getaddrinfo, inet_aton, inet_pton). It also reads input parameters such as host, port, username, and password provided to class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending data over sockets with _send, receiving data with _receive, and performing DNS resolution. The code also handles user credentials (username, password) and destination host/port data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, username, password) through address resolution and authentication steps, culminating in socket connection and negotiation with the proxy server. Input data can reach sinks via socket send/recv methods. Credentials are used in authentication requests. DNS resolution is performed before sending connect commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code includes standard network socket operations and proxy protocol logic. Error handling raises specific exceptions for proxy errors. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are evident. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or backdoors. The code seems to implement standard proxy communication procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers with support for address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It uses asyncio for non-blocking network I/O, which is standard. The code raises specific exceptions for different proxy errors and handles various address types correctly. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden network activity is apparent. Credentials are handled in a standard manner, and there is no hardcoded secret or backdoor. All operations align with expected proxy client behavior. The overall structure and functions follow legitimate proxy protocol implementations without signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no malicious behavior detected. It performs expected operations such as address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation without any signs of backdoors or malicious network activity.",
