{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous network communication, handling connection negotiation, address resolution, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials during connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into socket send and receive functions, and potentially into address resolution functions; no untrusted data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (host, port, credentials) are processed through address resolution and authentication steps, leading to socket connection and negotiation, with data exchanged via socket send/recv functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. Minor implementation detail in username/password packet formatting could be improved but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard SOCKS proxy protocol procedures, with proper exception handling and socket management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The authentication packet construction in SOCKS5 could be refined for protocol compliance, but this does not imply malicious activity. The overall structure and data flow are consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy clients. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The low security risk scores are justified given the benign nature of the code, and the malware score is correctly set to 0.",
