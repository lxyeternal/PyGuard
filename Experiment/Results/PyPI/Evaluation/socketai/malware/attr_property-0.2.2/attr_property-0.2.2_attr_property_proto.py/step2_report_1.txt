  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that the code implements SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for async communication.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Data flows are consistent with proxy negotiation, no suspicious data or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Focused on legitimate proxy functionality.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, implementing SOCKS proxies.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Data flows are standard; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious.\n- **Analysis:** Standard proxy protocol handling, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Standard socket and DNS operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores, consistent reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same, SOCKS4/SOCKS5 wrappers.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Data flows are typical; no suspicious data.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Typical socket data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's purpose and the analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports rate 0, which is justified given the code's clarity and standard implementation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The data flows are consistent with legitimate proxy connection procedures.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the detailed analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy client code)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, legitimate, and free of malware or obfuscation.",
