{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing asynchronous connection and negotiation with proxy servers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials provided during initialization and address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending crafted request bytes over sockets, especially during proxy negotiation, and resolving hostnames which could lead to data leakage if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, ports, credentials) through address resolution and negotiation steps, leading to socket communication for establishing proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs network I/O, address resolution, and protocol negotiation with standard libraries and well-defined protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various classes to handle proxy connections over SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It uses async functions for socket communication, resolving hostnames either locally or remotely based on configuration. Error handling covers common SOCKS errors and connection issues. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data manipulations are evident. The code does not perform any network communication outside the proxy negotiation process, nor does it contain suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration or command execution. The code is well-structured and follows expected patterns for such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy clients with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles standard proxy negotiation procedures securely, with proper error handling. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks within this code fragment.",
