{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, enabling connection and negotiation with proxy servers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket connections during negotiation, authentication, and address resolution processes, including input from proxy servers and DNS resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data over sockets during proxy negotiation and authentication. It receives data from sockets for server responses, address info, and proxy responses.",
  "flows": "Input data from user-specified host and port, DNS resolution, and proxy server responses flow into socket send/receive functions. Data flows from input to socket send, and server responses are processed to determine success or failure of proxy negotiations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or code injection methods are present. Usage of standard libraries and conventions, with proper exception handling. The code seems focused solely on proxy negotiation and connection handling, with no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network proxy negotiation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It reads and writes data to sockets, resolves hostnames, and manages authentication and connection processes. The functions follow standard protocol procedures. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, secret communications, or unauthorized system modifications. All data flows appear consistent with legitimate proxy connection operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behavior is observed. The code’s structure and functions suggest it is a utility module for proxy support, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asynchronous network operations. It does not show any malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose aligns with typical proxy connection handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
