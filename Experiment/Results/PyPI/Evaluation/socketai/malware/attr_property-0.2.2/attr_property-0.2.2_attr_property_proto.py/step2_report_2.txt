  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code and the overall context.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asyncio-based network communication.\n- They highlight that the code performs standard address resolution, authentication, connection negotiation, and socket handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or signs of malware are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (around 0.9 to 0.95), and all assign malware scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Issues are not present.** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- Exception handling seems appropriate.\n- Address resolution, socket management, and protocol steps follow expected patterns.\n- No signs of data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: between 0.1 and 0.2`\n- These seem reasonable given the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- No issues justify a risk score above 0.5.\n- The highest assigned risk is 0.2, which is appropriate for a network protocol implementation.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score justification\n- All reports assign malware score = 0.\n- Given the code performs standard proxy negotiation, with no signs of malicious activity, this is justified.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports are cautious but conclude no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- No assumptions are made that are unsupported by the code.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (low, typical for network protocol code)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Proper error handling and use of standard libraries.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.\n- The code's purpose is legitimate and aligns with common proxy client implementations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe provided code and reports collectively indicate a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.1–0.2).\n- No changes needed; the code appears safe and well-implemented.",
