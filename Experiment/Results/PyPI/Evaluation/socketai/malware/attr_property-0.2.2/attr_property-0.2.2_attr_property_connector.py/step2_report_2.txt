  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious intent, noting reliance on external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) whose implementations are unknown but appear standard. The code handles proxy configuration and custom DNS resolution without signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Given the benign analysis and lack of suspicious behavior, these scores seem appropriate. The slightly elevated risk score accounts for external dependencies and potential misconfigurations but isn't unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on proxy credentials and URL construction. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected. The code's behavior aligns with typical proxy handling.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  These are consistent with the analysis; the low risk reflects standard proxy configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on proxy setup, socket creation, and URL parsing. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected. The code relies on user input and external functions, but nothing indicates malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  These scores are reasonable given the benign nature and standard patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Describes proxy handling, URL parsing, and socket wrapping. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The code appears standard and safe.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Appropriate for the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on proxy URL parsing and connection setup. No suspicious behavior or malware signs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the analysis supports that there's no malicious code present. The external functions could be a concern if malicious, but their absence of evidence suggests benign behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in proxy configuration code, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Low, given the standard proxy handling and reliance on external, presumably safe functions.\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern could be the external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url`. If these are malicious or compromised, they could introduce risks. However, based on the provided code and typical usage, there's no evidence of such.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of proxy connection handling with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (average 0.15)  \n\nAny higher would be unjustified without evidence of malicious external functions or hidden behaviors.",
