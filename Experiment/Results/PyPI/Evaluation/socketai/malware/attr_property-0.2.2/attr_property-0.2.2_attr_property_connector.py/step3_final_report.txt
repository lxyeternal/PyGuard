{
  "purpose": "Provides proxy connection handling with customizable resolver and socket creation, facilitating proxy configuration and network communication.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy URL components, proxy credentials, and external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url`.",
  "sinks": "Constructed proxy URL, socket connection establishment, and request proxy updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → `proxy_url` property and socket wrapper creation → socket connection → request proxy update.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external functions whose implementations are unknown but appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs proxy URLs from parameters, manages socket creation via external utility, and handles proxy connection setup. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are evident. External functions are potential points of concern if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. The code follows standard practices for proxy handling and network connections, with credentials managed securely via parameters. The overall structure is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of proxy connection management. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present based on the provided code. External functions should be reviewed separately for security, but within this context, the code appears safe.",
