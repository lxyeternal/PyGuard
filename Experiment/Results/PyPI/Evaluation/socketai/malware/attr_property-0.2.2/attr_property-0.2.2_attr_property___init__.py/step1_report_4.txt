{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides SOCKS proxy connection functionalities, including error handling and connection management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), possibly reading class and function definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only defines and imports components without executing or handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports are static; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources is evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The version string is simple. The code structure is standard, with no dynamic execution or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module initializer that imports various components related to proxy connections and errors. It defines a version and exports relevant classes and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code appears well-structured and typical for a Python package module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup for a proxy-related library. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this limited fragment.",
