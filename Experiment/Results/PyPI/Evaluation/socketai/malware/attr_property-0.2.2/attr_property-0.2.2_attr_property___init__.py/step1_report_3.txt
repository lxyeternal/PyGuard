{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy connection, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no network or I/O operations are shown",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and re-exports components",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and functions from local modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It sets a version string. No runtime logic, no data processing, and no external data handling are present. It appears to be part of a larger package focused on SOCKS proxy functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports components related to SOCKS proxy handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no evidence of sabotage or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured part of a larger package.",
