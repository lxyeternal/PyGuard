  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the code snippet and the details provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports various components related to a SOCKS proxy library—such as connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types—and then defines a version string and an `__all__` list for exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is simply importing modules and exporting symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this code snippet.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and lacks malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, which seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed assessment:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate. There is no obfuscation or unusual code structure.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  All reports show high confidence (1), which aligns with the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a typical module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malware that are not supported by the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  Given the evidence, I would set the **malware score to 0**, **obfuscated score to 0**, and **security risk score to 0** for this code snippet.\n\n- **Overall risk assessment:**  \n  The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code provided.",
