{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a library for handling proxy connections, including importing necessary components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling beyond import and export statements",
  "flows": "Importing modules and exposing selected components",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns; no dynamic execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports components from local modules and defines a version and export list. It does not perform any data input/output, network communication, or sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. It appears to be a standard module initialization segment for a proxy-related package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It only handles imports and exports, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
