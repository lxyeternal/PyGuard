  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the code snippet, and evaluate the accuracy of the assessments, the scoring, and any potential risks.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward module that imports various components from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), sets a version string, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - There are no functions, network operations, data processing, or dynamic execution present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Review of Report Findings**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n   - They note the absence of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious indicators.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code being clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are all 0, which is reasonable.\n   - The `malware` scores are 0, justified by the lack of malicious activity.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n   - The `purpose` descriptions correctly identify the code as a module setup, not executing any harmful operations.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:\n   - Since the code is purely import/export statements with no runtime logic, assigning any higher risk scores would be unwarranted.\n   - The reports seem to overstate the benign nature, but given the code, that is justified.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected or claimed.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code appears entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are justified at 1, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports correctly identify the code as a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scoring is appropriate, and there are no grounds for concern based on this code snippet.",
