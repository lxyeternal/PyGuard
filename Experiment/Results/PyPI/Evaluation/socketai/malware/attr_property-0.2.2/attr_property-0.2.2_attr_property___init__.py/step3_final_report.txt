{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, importing core components and defining export symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with import statements, version declaration, and __all__ exports. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious code. All signals indicate a benign, standard package initialization file. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
