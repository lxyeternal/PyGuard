  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple module setup: importing components from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), defining a version string, and exporting these components via `__all__`.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution is present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code appears to be a typical package initialization segment for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - None of the reports identify any signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code is consistent with standard practices for module exports.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious imports, or unusual patterns are observed.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The code itself is benign; however, since it is part of a larger package, the security of the entire package depends on the other modules (connector, errors, helpers, proto). But based solely on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code is a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
