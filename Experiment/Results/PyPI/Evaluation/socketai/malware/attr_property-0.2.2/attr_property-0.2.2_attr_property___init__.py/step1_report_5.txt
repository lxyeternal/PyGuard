{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define an interface for a SOCKS proxy client, including imports of error handling, connection functions, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), likely from within the package.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing, external network calls, or data leaks shown in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; primarily imports and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of importing components from internal modules and defining an export list. No functions, network operations, or data handling is visible that could indicate malicious activity. It appears to be a straightforward module setup typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious package module initialization with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is part of a proxy client library setup.",
