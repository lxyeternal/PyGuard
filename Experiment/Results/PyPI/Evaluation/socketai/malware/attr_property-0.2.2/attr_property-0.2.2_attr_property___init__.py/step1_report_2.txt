{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy connection library, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly module setup and export statements",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The version string is a standard module version indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes and functions from local modules and then defines a version string and an __all__ list for exports. No dynamic execution, user input processing, or network activity is present. All imported elements are related to SOCKS proxy functionality, and the module setup appears standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It simply organizes and exports relevant components.",
