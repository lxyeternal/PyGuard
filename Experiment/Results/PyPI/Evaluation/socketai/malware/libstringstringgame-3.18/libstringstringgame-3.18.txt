      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The setup code appears legitimate, but the embedded payload and obfuscation tactics warrant serious concern. The assigned scores are justified, and the code should be flagged for further analysis or removal from supply chain distributions."
