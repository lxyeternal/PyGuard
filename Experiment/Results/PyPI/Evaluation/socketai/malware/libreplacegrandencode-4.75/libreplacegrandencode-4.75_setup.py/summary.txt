  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious activity through obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, triggered by the absence of a specific directory. The behavior is characteristic of malware attempting stealthy remote code execution. The package should be considered malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms safety."
