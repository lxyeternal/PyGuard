  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pepequests' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The script reads static data from the setup() function parameters (name, packages, version, etc.). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs in this code; it only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink involving untrusted data; the code merely executes static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard distutils setup without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python setup script using distutils to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no external input handling, and no suspicious behaviors. It is typical boilerplate for package distribution. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
