  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pepequests' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, packages, version, license, author, keywords, install_requires, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs present; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py pattern with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports distutils.core and calls setup() with static arguments defining package metadata. All inputs are hardcoded, with no dynamic or user-supplied data. There are no suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, credential handling, or code injection. The code appears to be a typical package setup script. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
