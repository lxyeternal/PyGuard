  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the Python package 'pepequests'.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the setup() function parameters, such as package name, version, author, etc.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; standard setup script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable assignments into the setup() function call, which then uses them for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses distutils.core's setup() to define package metadata, including name, packages, version, license, author, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or suspicious behaviors, nor any code that interacts with external sources, executes untrusted code, or manipulates data insecurely. The code appears straightforward and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indications.",
