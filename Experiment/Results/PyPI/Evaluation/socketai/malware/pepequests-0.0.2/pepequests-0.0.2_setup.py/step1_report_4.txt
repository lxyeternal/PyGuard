{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pepequests', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, packages, version, license, author, classifiers). No external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the script only sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'distutils.core' which is deprecated in favor of 'setuptools'; however, this is not malicious, just a potential concern for maintainability. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python module. It contains static metadata with no external data reading, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are detected. The usage of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' may suggest outdated practices but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata for distribution.",
