  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pepequests' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, packages, version, license, author, keywords, install_requires, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static metadata definitions without any data input or output operations; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of 'distutils.core' is standard but somewhat outdated, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but not malicious. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or include suspicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
