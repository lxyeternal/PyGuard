{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using setup from distutils.core, with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists within the setup() call, including package name, version, author, classifiers, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks or network calls present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only minor concern is the use of 'distutils.core', which is deprecated but not malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package configuration script with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
