{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded command and executes it during package installation, which contacts a remote server to fetch data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in notmalfunc(), executed via os.system() during AfterInstall.run()",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing the decoded command that performs a network request",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system() during the run of AfterInstall, leading to network contact",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a network command, execution during package setup, contacting a private IP address, no validation or sanitization of external input",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to decode base64 data, which encodes a shell command to perform an HTTP GET request to a local IP address, piping the result to 'base' (likely base64). During the package's installation process, the function notmalfunc() is called, executing this command via os.system(). This behavior indicates malicious activity, such as remote code fetching or establishing a backdoor. The use of base64 obfuscation further suggests malicious intent. The network contact is to a private IP, which could be internal testing or malicious control. The code's behavior is consistent with known supply chain attacks, executing remote commands during setup, and obfuscating intent. The malware score is 0.9, obfuscation 0.8, and security risk 0.9, reflecting high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a network request during installation, using obfuscation to hide this activity. The scores assigned are justified and indicate a high security threat.",
