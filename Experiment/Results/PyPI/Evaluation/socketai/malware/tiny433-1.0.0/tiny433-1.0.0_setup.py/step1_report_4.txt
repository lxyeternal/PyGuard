{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a decoded base64-encoded command during installation.",
  "sources": "The function b64d() which decodes base64 string, called within notmalfunc() during package installation.",
  "sinks": "os.system() execution of decoded command, which executes shell commands on the system.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system(), executing the decoded command during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution via os.system() suggests obfuscation of the true intent. The decoded command makes an HTTP request, likely to an external server, which is suspicious. The code includes no comments explaining the purpose of the request. The command URL points to an IP address with a port, and the request is made during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a helper function to decode base64 strings. It defines two custom classes extending setuptools commands, which execute the notmalfunc() during installation. notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string that translates to a shell command performing an HTTP GET request to a specific IP address and port. This command is executed automatically during package installation via the AfterInstall class. The presence of base64 decoding and execution of external HTTP request during install indicates obfuscation and potentially malicious behavior, such as contacting an external server for command-and-control or data exfiltration. No other suspicious or malicious code is present outside this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes an external HTTP request during installation, which is highly suspicious. This behavior indicates malicious intent, potentially for command-and-control communication or data exfiltration. The use of base64 and dynamic command execution increases the risk profile of this package.",
