{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with potentially malicious behavior that executes code during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decodes a base64-encoded string, and notmalfunc calls os.system with decoded code; run() methods in custom commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system in notmalfunc executes decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary command execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded by b64d -> executed by os.system in notmalfunc during install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution via os.system with decoded content; code runs during package installation and development setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines functions for decoding base64-encoded code, which is then executed via os.system during package installation (notmalfunc). The base64 string decodes to a command that makes an HTTP request to an external server. The custom install class triggers this command upon installation. This pattern indicates intentional malicious behavior designed to execute external code or contact a remote server during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that executes a remote command during installation, indicating high malicious intent. The approach of decoding and executing code dynamically during setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
