  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or function (not explicitly provided), likely related to data processing or utility functions based on typical code structure.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, user input prompts, or environment variables (exact details not provided).",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocess calls; specific sinks are not explicitly identified due to lack of detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, possibly involving external modules or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code features are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to follow standard Python practices with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. There are no suspicious external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no evident data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical. Without explicit source or sink code provided, the assessment is limited, but based on available information, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no evident security risks or anomalies.",
