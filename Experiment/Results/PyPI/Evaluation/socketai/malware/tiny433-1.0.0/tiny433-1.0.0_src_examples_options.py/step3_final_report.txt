{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, potentially involving network or external data inputs, with possible dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from network requests, environment variables, or external files; potential use of eval/exec functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, system commands, or dynamic code execution points that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as network requests or environment variables flow into functions like eval, exec, or system calls, which could lead to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic imports; no explicit obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily involved in data processing with potential external data inputs. Without concrete code snippets, the analysis relies on typical patterns. The presence of dynamic execution functions or network operations would elevate concern, but none are explicitly confirmed. The scores reflect low suspicion, with a malware score of 0.2 and a security risk of 0.2, aligning with cautious but non-alarming assessments. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The confidence is moderate (0.6), given the lack of specific code evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows minimal malicious indicators, with potential concerns around untrusted data handling. The low malware and risk scores are justified based on available information. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
