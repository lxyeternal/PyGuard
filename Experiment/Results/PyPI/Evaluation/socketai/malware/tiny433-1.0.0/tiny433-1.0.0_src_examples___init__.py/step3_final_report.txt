  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution (eval), obfuscation techniques.",
  "sinks": "Potential network communication, dynamic code execution points, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval lead to sinks like network calls or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval, obfuscation, cryptic variable names, suspicious domain/IP usage, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The use of eval and obfuscation techniques increases suspicion but no explicit malicious payload (e.g., data theft, system damage) is confirmed. The code appears primarily intended for data processing with some risky constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.3, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.65) are justified based on these observations. The absence of code snippets limits definitive conclusions, but the current assessments are consistent with the described features.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and justified given the evidence. Report 2's higher obfuscation and eval usage warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious activity is present. Overall, the dependency appears low risk with some suspicion in specific areas.",
