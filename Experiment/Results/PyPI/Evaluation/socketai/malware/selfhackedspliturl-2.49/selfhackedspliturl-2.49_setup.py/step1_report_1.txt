{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedspliturl' with package 'modlib'.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, attempts to check for existence of 'tahg' directory, and runs an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with shell=False; possible network activity or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, executes obfuscated PowerShell command -> Setup function defines package details.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW; no clear purpose; potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core. It then tries to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if the directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell command through subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, which could be malicious activity such as executing hidden code or connecting to external servers. The setup() function is called with package details, which appears benign. The obfuscated command and the check for directory existence without further context are suspicious. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window, which could be malicious. The setup process itself appears standard, but the hidden command warrants further investigation. Overall, there is a moderate to high concern regarding malicious intent due to the obfuscated command execution.",
