  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating potential malicious activity such as remote payload delivery or system compromise. The package setup appears benign, but the obfuscated command's behavior and embedded URL suggest malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional logic justify a high security risk and malware score. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious behavior, but current evidence warrants treating this as a high-risk, potentially malicious package."
