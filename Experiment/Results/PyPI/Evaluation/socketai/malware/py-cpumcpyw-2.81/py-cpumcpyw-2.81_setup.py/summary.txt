  "malware_score": 0.9,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution referencing a suspicious domain, constituting a serious supply chain security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend setting malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores to 0.9 to reflect maximum severity."
