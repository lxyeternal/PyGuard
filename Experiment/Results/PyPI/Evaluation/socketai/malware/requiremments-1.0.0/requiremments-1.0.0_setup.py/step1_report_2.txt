{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom install command that executes potentially malicious code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules (requests, fernet), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() of decrypted code, which can execute arbitrary Python commands, potentially malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a string with Fernet, then executes it via exec(), allowing for remote or arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted string executed via exec() indicates obfuscation; the decrypted code is not visible, raising suspicion. The use of cryptography and dynamic execution during setup is unusual and potentially malicious. The code appears designed to hide its true intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that runs during package setup. On Windows systems, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a string using Fernet symmetric encryption. The decrypted string is then executed with exec(), which can run any Python code. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as downloading or executing remote code, or establishing backdoors. The code also includes obfuscated variable and class names, which is suspicious. The setup metadata appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious install behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes hidden code via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates an intentional attempt to execute arbitrary code, potentially for malicious purposes. The obfuscation and encrypted payload reinforce concerns of malicious intent.",
