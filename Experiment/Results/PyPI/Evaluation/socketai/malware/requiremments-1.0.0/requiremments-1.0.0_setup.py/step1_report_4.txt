  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs an obfuscated code segment during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, os, requests, fernet; environment checks; embedded encrypted code in run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() which may execute arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code checks if OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes embedded code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable and class names; encrypted payload executed via exec(); no visible legitimate functionality; suspicious long descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks but includes a custom install command that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code embedded within a Fernet-encrypted string. The use of encrypted code combined with dynamic execution via exec() is a red flag for malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution without transparency. The code does not reveal its purpose explicitly, and the encrypted payload could contain malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious code execution during installation. No other suspicious library usage or hardcoded credentials are apparent outside the encrypted payload.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated code that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially serving as a backdoor or performing unauthorized actions. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are typical indicators of malicious package behavior.",
