{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation on Windows, decrypts and executes an encrypted payload via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The custom install class reads environment info (os.name), and during Windows installation, imports requests and fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code checks os.name, then imports modules, decrypts payload with Fernet, and executes it via exec(), enabling malicious code execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload, obfuscated class name, conditional execution during setup, use of exec() on decrypted code, and hardcoded cryptographic keys are highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process with an obfuscated class that, on Windows, imports requests and fernet, decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and dynamic execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscation, encrypted code, and conditional execution during installation strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly to deliver backdoors or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.85, security risk ~0.9) are consistent with this analysis. The pattern is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to execute arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to encrypted payload decryption and execution during setup, obfuscation, and conditional behavior on Windows. The assigned scores are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious.",
