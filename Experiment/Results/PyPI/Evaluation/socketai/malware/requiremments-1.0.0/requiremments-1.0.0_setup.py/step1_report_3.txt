{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'requiremments' with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes decrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements, embedded encrypted string, decrypt and exec call within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing potentially malicious modules ('requests' and 'fernet') without verification.",
  "flows": "The code checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts and executes code via exec(), which is a source-to-sink flow that can run malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded encrypted payload and the dynamic execution of decrypted code, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code executes unverified decrypted code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install class that executes encrypted code when on Windows. The encrypted payload is decrypted at runtime and executed via exec(), which is a common technique to hide malicious code. The package's setup metadata appears normal but the execution behavior is suspicious due to the embedded encrypted string and dynamic code execution. There are no external inputs or untrusted sources at runtime; however, the embedded encrypted code and execution method raise significant security concerns. The code's purpose is obscured, and the pattern aligns with malicious obfuscation tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior, notably the decrypt-and-execute pattern within a custom installation class, which could run arbitrary code upon package installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution suggests malicious intent or sabotage, posing a high security risk.",
