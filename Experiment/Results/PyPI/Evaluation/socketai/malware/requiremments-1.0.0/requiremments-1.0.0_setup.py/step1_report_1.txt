{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and a custom installation step that executes code based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec() on the Fernet-encrypted payload, which could execute arbitrary code when run on Windows.",
  "flows": "The source 'os.name' triggers conditional import and execution. If on Windows, it decrypts and executes a payload, representing a flow from environment check to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and use of exec() on decrypted code suggest suspicious activity. The payload is encrypted, indicating an attempt to hide behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup configuration with obfuscated and encrypted code designed to execute additional code during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload (using Fernet) is decrypted and run via exec(), which is a significant security concern. The code does not log or validate the decrypted content, implying potential malicious intent. The rest of the script appears standard for package setup, but the conditional execution of hidden code on Windows, coupled with obfuscation, is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, encrypted payload that executes during installation on Windows, indicating malicious intent. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially installing backdoors or malicious software during setup.",
