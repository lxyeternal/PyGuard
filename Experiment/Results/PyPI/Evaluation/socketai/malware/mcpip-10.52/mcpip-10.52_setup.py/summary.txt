  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating probable malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth execution, and concealment of errors justify a high malware and security risk score. Further decoding of the payload is necessary to confirm malicious intent, but caution is advised, and the package should be treated as potentially dangerous."
