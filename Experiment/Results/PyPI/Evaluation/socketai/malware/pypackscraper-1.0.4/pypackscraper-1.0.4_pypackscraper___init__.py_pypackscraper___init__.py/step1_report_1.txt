{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code likely intended to execute hidden or malicious operations, possibly involving decoding or executing payloads.",
  "sources": "Reading hard-coded base64-encoded strings and obfuscated string literals, which are decoded and decompressed to obtain data or code segments.",
  "sinks": "Eval execution of dynamically decoded and decompressed code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Code decodes and decompresses strings, then evaluates or executes the resulting code via eval, executing potentially malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple layers of obfuscation including base64, zlib decompression, character manipulation, and eval; hard-coded strings and encoded data are indicative of concealment. The lambda function also generates code from numbers and string operations, further indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with complex string literals and obfuscation techniques, such as encoding data with base64, compressing it with zlib, and then decoding and executing it at runtime via eval. The lambda function constructs code dynamically using character codes derived from calculations on hard-coded numbers, and this code is then run, likely to conceal malicious payloads. The large amount of obfuscated data and layered decoding strongly suggest an intent to hide malicious operations, such as executing hidden code or payloads, or performing unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated, employs dynamic code execution, and contains multiple layers of decoding and decompression, all of which are common in malicious scripts designed to conceal malicious payloads. The presence of eval with decoded code strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to execute hidden or harmful operations on the system. Due to these indicators, this package should be considered malicious or dangerous.",
