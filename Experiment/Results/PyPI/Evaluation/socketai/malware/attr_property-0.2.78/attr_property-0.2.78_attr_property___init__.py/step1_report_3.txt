{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports modules, classes, and functions related to a SOCKS proxy connection library, including error handling and connection helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe actions are present",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or data manipulation observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module initializer that imports classes, functions, and constants, then exports them. There are no input processing, data handling, or external communications. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified. The code appears standard and safe, functioning as a part of a larger package for SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It’s a typical package index file with no indicators of malicious activity.",
