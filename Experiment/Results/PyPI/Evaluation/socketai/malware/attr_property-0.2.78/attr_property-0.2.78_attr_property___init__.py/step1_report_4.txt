{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python library for handling SOCKS proxy connections, providing classes and functions related to proxy connection management and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), likely reading internal module data and user input when used in the larger package.",
  "sinks": "Exports via __all__, potentially exposing functions and classes to other modules; no direct untrusted data sinks or network operations are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly observable in this snippet, but likely involves external input via imported functions or classes, which are then made available for use in other parts of the program.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, primarily defining imports and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata, imports necessary components for proxy handling, error management, and helper functions, and exposes these via __all__ for external use. It does not contain any input/output operations, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or backdoors. All imported modules appear relevant to proxy management, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library. It merely imports and re-exports components without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There is no indication of malware or security risks in this fragment.",
