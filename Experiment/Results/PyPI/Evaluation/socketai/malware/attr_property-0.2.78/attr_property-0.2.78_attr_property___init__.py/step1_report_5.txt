{
  "purpose": "To define and export various components, error classes, and helper functions for a SOCKS proxy client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external data handling within this snippet",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports components; no data flows or untrusted data handling are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules and defines a module version and export list. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or file manipulations. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py or main module initializer. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign package initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
