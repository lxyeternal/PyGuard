  "purpose": "Module initializer and API export setup for a SOCKS proxy library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export code.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, only import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing classes, functions, and exceptions, defining a version, and exposing symbols via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these scores. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across all analyses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or security risks detected. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
