  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors are reported.\n- The code only performs import and export operations, with no data processing, network activity, or external input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The reported malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that there’s no malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are purely import/export definitions, serving as an API or interface layer.\n- The consistency across reports indicates a high confidence in benignity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, confirming no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk scores are 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are 0, as there are no signs of security issues or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree, there is no evidence suggesting any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a standard module setup, typical in open source projects, with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- Given the code content and the reports, I would maintain the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided in the reports.",
