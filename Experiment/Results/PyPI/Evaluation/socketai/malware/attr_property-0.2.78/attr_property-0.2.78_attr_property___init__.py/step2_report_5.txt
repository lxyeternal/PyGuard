  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements, an explicit version string, and an `__all__` list defining the public API.\n   - There are no functions, no data processing, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code appears to be an `__init__.py` or module setup file for a SOCKS proxy handling library, exposing classes, functions, and exceptions from internal modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity:**\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - No data sinks or sources that could be exploited.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is purely structural, setting up module exports.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as a benign module initializer, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, external input handling, or network operations.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The malware scores are 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the lack of any malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the absence of any malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, since there are no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors evident.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is part of a larger package and do not consider any external malicious modifications. However, based on the provided snippet, there's no indication of tampering or malicious intent.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n6. **Final Expert Estimate:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. It does not contain any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk.",
