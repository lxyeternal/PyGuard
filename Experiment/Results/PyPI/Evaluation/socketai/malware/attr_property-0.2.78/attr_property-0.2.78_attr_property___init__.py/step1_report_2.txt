{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define an interface for a SOCKS proxy client, importing various classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connection management and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and possibly from user code that uses these exports. No external input is directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks are not explicitly present in this code. If imported functions or classes are used elsewhere, they could handle network connections or sensitive data, but this is not shown here.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up exports and versioning. No data flow, input processing, or untrusted data handling is observable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs in this module. The code structure is straightforward, with standard import statements and explicit exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and defines an __all__ list for export, along with a version string. It appears to serve as an interface or API module for a SOCKS proxy package. There are no indications of data processing, user input handling, or network activity within this snippet. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not contain any suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a proxy client library, mainly handling module exports and versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
