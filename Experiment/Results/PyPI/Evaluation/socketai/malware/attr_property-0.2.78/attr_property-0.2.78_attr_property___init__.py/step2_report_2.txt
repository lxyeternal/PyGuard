  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that:\n- Imports classes, functions, exceptions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string.\n- Exports these symbols via `__all__`.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Evaluation:**\n- The code contains only import statements, a version string, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or any suspicious constructs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The module appears to be part of a larger package for SOCKS proxy handling, serving as an interface or initializer.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\nAll five reports consistently conclude that:\n- The code is benign, serving as a module setup or interface.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation.\n- The confidence score is 1 for all, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Security risk is also 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Logical and scoring consistency:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately low (0), given the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent with each other.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points to challenge:**\n- Since the code is purely import/export definitions with no dynamic or network activity, there's no basis for higher malware or risk scores.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and safe.\n\n**Final assessment:**\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign module initializer for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or security-risk behavior.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain component appears safe and well-structured, serving solely as an interface for other parts of the package. No changes to the reported scores are necessary.",
