  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module initializer, primarily consisting of import statements, version declaration, and an export list (__all__).\n- No evidence of data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger package, serving as an interface or API layer.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import/export pattern.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, indicating no apparent security issues or vulnerabilities in this fragment.\n- **Source and sink analysis:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident; no network or file operations are performed here.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since this is just an import and export module, it cannot contain malicious logic by itself.\n- The only possible concern could be if the imported modules (.connector, .errors, etc.) contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The reports correctly focus on this code fragment, which appears safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary based on the evidence provided.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the reports: this code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\nThis is consistent with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** The security of the overall package depends on the contents of the imported modules, but based solely on this fragment, there are no concerns.",
