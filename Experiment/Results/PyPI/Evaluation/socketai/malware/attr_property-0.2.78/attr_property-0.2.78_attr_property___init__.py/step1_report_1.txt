{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy handling library, defining imports, exceptions, and helpers related to SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; imports from local modules suggest internal data or configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or system effect; no network, file, or environment variable operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; the code mainly sets up imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily import statements and version declaration; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an interface or module initializer, importing classes, functions, and exceptions from local files. There are no input operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. The presence of only imports and definitions indicates this is part of a larger package, and by itself, it does not perform any malicious activity. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines available classes, exceptions, and functions for other parts of the package.",
