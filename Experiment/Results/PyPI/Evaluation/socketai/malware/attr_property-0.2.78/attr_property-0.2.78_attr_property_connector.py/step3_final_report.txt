{
  "purpose": "Implements a customizable proxy connector for aiohttp supporting various proxy types, with optional DNS resolution bypass and dynamic URL construction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy configuration (host, port, username, password), external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), and proxy URL scheme.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL formation, socket creation for non-HTTP proxies, connection establishment, and request proxy updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → proxy_url property → socket wrapper creation (for non-HTTP) or URL update (for HTTP) → connection setup via super methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures; external helper functions are not provided but are assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector supporting multiple proxy types with optional DNS resolution bypass. It constructs proxy URLs dynamically, manages socket creation for non-HTTP proxies via an external helper, and handles connection logic accordingly. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. External functions are potential risk points but appear legitimate based on context. The code is clear, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscation or secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. External helper functions could pose risks if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
