{
  "purpose": "Defines custom proxy connection handling for aiohttp, including no-resolver support and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy configuration data from class attributes, environment variables (if used externally), and input URLs.",
  "sinks": "Creates socket connections, potentially exposing proxy credentials, and initiates network connections.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing → socket wrapper creation → connection establishment, with proxy credentials potentially used in URL and socket wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials present; no suspicious URL or data leaks detected; code structure normal; no obfuscated or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a proxy connector class for aiohttp with support for custom proxy types, including no-resolver option. It constructs proxy URLs dynamically, uses external helpers for parsing URLs, and creates socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies. The code handles proxy credentials securely via instance variables, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. Connection methods and URL formatting follow standard patterns. No unusual or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard proxy connection handler for aiohttp with support for custom proxy configurations and no-resolver. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code maintains security best practices and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
