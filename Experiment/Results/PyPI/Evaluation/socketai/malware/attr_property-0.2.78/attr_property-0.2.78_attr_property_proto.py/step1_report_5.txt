{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports provided for connection, and data read from socket connections (e.g., during negotiate, authentication, and address resolution).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are socket send and receive functions, which could send or receive untrusted data over the network, and address resolution functions. No direct data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, ports, user credentials) through socket connection and negotiation functions, with address resolution and authentication steps, into socket communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs standard proxy connection procedures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. Uses standard socket and asyncio methods; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. No malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides proxy socket connection classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with proper address resolution, authentication, and connection handling. It employs standard networking practices, including error handling and asynchronous socket communication. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors are present. It does not include any code injection, suspicious external requests, or obfuscated logic. The code adheres to typical implementations of SOCKS proxies, with secure handling of credentials and connection flow. Therefore, it appears to be a legitimate and secure implementation of proxy sockets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles proxy negotiation, address resolution, and authentication properly, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
