  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio.\n- They consistently find no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The reports assign very low malware scores (0), obfuscated scores (0), and security risks (~0.2), which seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (above 0.9), indicating the reviewers are quite certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to implement SOCKS protocols correctly, including address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities beyond standard proxy operation, which is expected.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or errors are apparent. The reasoning in the reports aligns with the code's implementation.\n- The error handling and protocol adherence are standard and appropriate.\n- The scores assigned to malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Around 0.2, reflecting minor inherent risks in proxy usage but no malicious code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned; the highest is 0.2, which seems justified.\n- The low risk reflects the code's legitimate, standard implementation.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minimal inherent risk in proxy code, but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk posed by this code is negligible. It appears safe for deployment in legitimate applications.",
