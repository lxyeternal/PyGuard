  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, destination address resolution, user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting to proxy and destination, data transmission over the socket.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> address resolution -> proxy connection -> negotiation/authentication -> data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; code follows standard protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles connection, address resolution, authentication, and protocol negotiation correctly. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. Error handling and protocol adherence are appropriate. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse but not inherent maliciousness. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety for supply chain deployment.",
