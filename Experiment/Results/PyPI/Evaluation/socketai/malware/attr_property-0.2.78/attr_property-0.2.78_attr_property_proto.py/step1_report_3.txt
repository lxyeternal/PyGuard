{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to facilitate proxy connections, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket operations (_loop.sock_recv, _loop.sock_sendall, _loop.getaddrinfo), and user-supplied parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over socket connections, potentially to remote proxy servers; reads data from sockets; resolves hostnames to IP addresses.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) is used to build proxy requests; these requests are sent to proxy servers; responses are processed and used to establish a connection; data flows through the socket once connected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no evidence of backdoors or malicious code; reliance on external libraries (asyncio, socket) is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious network activities or data leaks identified; error handling appears normal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard proxy socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with proper address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment procedures. It uses typical async socket operations, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain any unusual or malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior. The structure and implementation follow expected proxy connection workflows, and no signs of malicious sabotage or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without malicious intent. It performs standard network proxy operations securely and correctly. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident based on this review.",
