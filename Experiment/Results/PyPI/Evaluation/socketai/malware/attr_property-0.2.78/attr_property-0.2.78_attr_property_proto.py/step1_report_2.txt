{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols to facilitate network connections via proxies in an asynchronous environment.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets using 'sock_recv', and input parameters such as host, port, username, and password are provided to establish connections and authentication.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to network sockets via 'sock_sendall'. Potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if untrusted data is mishandled, but there are no evident unsafe data processing or direct data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into connection and authentication routines; data received from network sockets flow into validation and parsing functions. There is no evidence of data being sent to external, untrusted endpoints or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code utilizes standard libraries and patterns for proxy communication. No obfuscation or misleading variable usage is detected. The error handling appears conventional and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection wrappers using asyncio, handling connection, negotiation, and authentication. It performs address resolution, socket communication, and error handling in a manner consistent with normal proxy client behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. All data handling and network communication follow expected patterns for a proxy client. The use of hardcoded error messages and constants is typical. The only potential concern could be reliance on external data (hostnames and credentials), but this is inherent in proxy client functionality and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without any detectable malicious intent. It follows standard practices for network connection management and proxy negotiation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is safe from a supply chain malicious code perspective.",
