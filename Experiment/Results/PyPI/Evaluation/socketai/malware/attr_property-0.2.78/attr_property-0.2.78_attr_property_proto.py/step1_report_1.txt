{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio-based connections, allowing clients to establish connections through a proxy server.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user-supplied hostnames, port numbers, and optional user credentials; reads data from network responses during SOCKS handshake and connection process.",
  "sinks": "Sends crafted SOCKS protocol requests and responses to the proxy server; potentially writes data to the network socket during connection and negotiation phases.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (host, port, credentials) are used to generate protocol requests, which are sent to the proxy server. Responses are read and processed to establish the connection. Once established, data flows bidirectionally between client and destination through the proxy socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data present. The code strictly adheres to SOCKS protocol standards; no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network scanning, or system compromise routines are visible. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors detected. The error handling appears standard and expected for such proxy implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio, with proper input resolution, negotiation, and error handling. It manages network communication securely without suspicious logic. No evidence of malicious behavior, hidden data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate component of a network utility library. The only potential concern could be misuse of proxy functionality if exploited for malicious activities, but that depends on user intent outside this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles network protocol details responsibly and does not contain hidden or malicious code segments. The security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. It appears safe for use in legitimate applications.",
