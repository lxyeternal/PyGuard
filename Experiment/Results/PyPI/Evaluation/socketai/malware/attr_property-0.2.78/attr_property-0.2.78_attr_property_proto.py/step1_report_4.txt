{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating connections through proxy servers with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from host, port, and optional user credentials; receives data from network sockets; resolves DNS addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sends proxy negotiation requests, authentication data, and destination connection commands; receives server responses and address data.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> DNS resolution (if needed) -> Proxy negotiation requests -> Server response handling -> Final connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns; code performs standard proxy operations without suspicious behavior. Exception handling is appropriate for network errors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio. It includes functions for address resolution, socket connection, proxy negotiation, and optional authentication. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or secret communications. Error handling is appropriate and based on expected proxy server responses. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected; the code aligns with standard proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a proxy client for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, implementing standard features such as DNS resolution and optional authentication. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code appears secure and appropriate for its purpose.",
