  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, given standard implementation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with standard proxy client implementation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code appears to be a typical SOCKS proxy wrapper, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with proper handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, consistent with typical proxy code.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's apparent purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. All reports correctly conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware scores of 0 across all reports are justified, given the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are also 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** The security risk scores are low (0.2), which is reasonable for proxy client code that, if misused, could facilitate malicious activities but is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering potential misuse but no inherent issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
