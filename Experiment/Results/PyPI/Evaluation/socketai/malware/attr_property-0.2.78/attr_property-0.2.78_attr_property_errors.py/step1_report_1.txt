  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, external communications, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception definitions with no additional logic, parameters, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. No data is read or written, no network communication, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It poses no security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors.",
