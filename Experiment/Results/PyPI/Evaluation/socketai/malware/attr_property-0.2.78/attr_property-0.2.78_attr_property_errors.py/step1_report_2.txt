  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present; class definitions do not read data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions for SOCKS and connection errors. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
