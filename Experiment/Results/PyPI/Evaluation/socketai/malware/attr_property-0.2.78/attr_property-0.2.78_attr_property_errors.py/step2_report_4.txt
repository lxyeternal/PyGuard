  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign and purely defines exception classes.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code poses no security risk or malware is justified.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - Security risk: 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n   - The confidence score is 1.0 across all reports, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0.0, there is no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts—these are class definitions with no suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
