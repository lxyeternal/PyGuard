  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only consists of simple class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No data reading, writing, external communication, or malicious activity is present.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are noted.\n   - The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the lack of obfuscation, data flow, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - Security risk: 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0.0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.**",
