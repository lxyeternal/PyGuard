{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could leak information or perform malicious actions",
  "flows": "The code only declares exception classes; there are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual coding practices present; code is straightforward class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other custom errors. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The purpose appears to be to facilitate error handling in a SOCKS proxy implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
