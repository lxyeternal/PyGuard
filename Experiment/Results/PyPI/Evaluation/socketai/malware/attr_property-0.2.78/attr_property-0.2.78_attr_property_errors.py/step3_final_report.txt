{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no data input/output or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares classes without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, serving as error indicators for SOCKS proxy operations. No data reading, writing, network communication, or dynamic behavior is present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The reasoning is consistent and justified, with high confidence that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
