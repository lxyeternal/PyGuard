  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of straightforward exception class definitions with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. This reasoning is accurate given the code snippet. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0.0 and a security risk of 0.0, which is appropriate. Since the code is just class definitions, these scores are reasonable. The obfuscated score is also 0.0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   No report assigns a risk score above 0.0, which is justified. The code is purely definitional and does not perform any actions that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.0, indicating no malicious activity. This aligns with the code content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Summary & Personal Estimate**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the assessments provided. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves its purpose without introducing any security concerns.",
