  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for various custom exception types inheriting from standard Python exceptions. These classes are used for error handling related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There is no data input, output, or execution logic, and no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for defining exception hierarchies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining exception classes for error handling with no malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, safe set of class definitions for error management.",
