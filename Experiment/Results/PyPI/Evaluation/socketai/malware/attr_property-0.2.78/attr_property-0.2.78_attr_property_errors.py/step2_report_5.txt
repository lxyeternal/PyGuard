  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network communication, or processing occurs.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- All reports confidently assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the description: it only defines exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions.\n   - No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Logic and reasoning flaws:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no processing logic.\n   - No reasoning flaws are apparent; the conclusion that this code is benign is justified.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - Risk score: 0, since no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly state that the code is safe.\n   - No claims of malicious activity are made, which aligns with the code content.\n\n5. **Consistency and justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) in each report is justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The overall assessment of the code is that it is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the code poses no security risks or malware concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security vulnerabilities or suspicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
