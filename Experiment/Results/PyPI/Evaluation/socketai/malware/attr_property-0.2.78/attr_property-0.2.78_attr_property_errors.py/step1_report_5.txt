  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines exception classes without external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output handling, or source-to-sink paths in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely contains class definitions for exceptions; no unusual or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from standard exception hierarchies. There is no data processing, external input, or suspicious activity present. The code appears to be part of a larger application or library for error handling without any malicious logic or behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxies and connections. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger system.",
