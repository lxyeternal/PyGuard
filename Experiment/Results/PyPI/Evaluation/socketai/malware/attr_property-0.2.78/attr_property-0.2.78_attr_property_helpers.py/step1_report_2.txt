{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and manage network connections through SOCKS proxy servers, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, primarily for asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs (parse_proxy_url), reading input parameters such as socks_url, host, port, username, password.",
  "sinks": "Connecting to proxies via create_socket_wrapper, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection; potential data flow from untrusted inputs to network connections.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing -> create socket wrapper -> connect socket -> open connection to target host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; code structure and flow are typical for proxy connection setup. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully parses user-provided proxy URLs, handles connection setup asynchronously via asyncio, and allows configuration of proxy parameters. It performs input validation for host, port, and protocol factory. The functions utilize well-known libraries and patterns without obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, intended for proxy connections, and does not include any suspicious or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection handling without malicious intent. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
