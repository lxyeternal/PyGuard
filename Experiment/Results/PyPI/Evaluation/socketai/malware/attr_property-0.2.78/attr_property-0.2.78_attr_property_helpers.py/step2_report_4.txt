  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- It performs minimal validation: checks for host and port presence, validates URL scheme and host, and handles proxy URL parsing.\n- It relies on external libraries (yarl, attr_property, asyncio, socket), which are standard.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The main potential security concern is the use of untrusted proxy URLs, which could redirect or intercept traffic, but this is inherent to proxy usage, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of Issues\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. The validation is minimal but sufficient for the context.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes\n\n- The code handles errors gracefully, raising appropriate exceptions.\n- Validation is minimal but acceptable given the context.\n- The only minor point is that the code assumes the external socket wrappers (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`) are secure and trustworthy, but that is outside the code scope.\n\n**Verdict:** No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting that the main concern is trusting external proxies, not code maliciousness.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the code's nature, the scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Risk justification\n\n- The risk is mainly from **misuse** of proxy URLs, which could lead to traffic interception or redirection, but this is inherent in proxy usage, not a code flaw.\n- No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The code is a standard utility with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions\n\n- The reports assume minimal validation and potential misuse, which is fair.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behaviors are justified; the code is transparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (due to potential proxy misuse, which is typical)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate\n\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — reflects the inherent risk of proxy misuse, not malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate utility for proxy connections with appropriate validation and no malicious indicators. The primary concern is trusting external proxies, which is typical for such utilities, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my assessment. The scores could be slightly adjusted to reflect the inherent proxy trust issue, but overall, they are reasonable.",
