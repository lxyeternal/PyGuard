  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and evaluating the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers based on proxy type, and manages connections via asyncio.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`yarl`, `attr_property`) and external socket wrapper classes (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The primary concern is the potential misuse if malicious proxy URLs are provided, which is inherent in proxy configuration but not indicative of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- The code performs minimal validation:\n  - Checks for non-empty host in `parse_proxy_url`.\n  - Validates port as an integer.\n  - Validates presence of `host` and `port` in connection functions.\n- No security vulnerabilities like injection, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are apparent.\n- The use of untrusted URLs without DNS security checks is noted but is typical for such utilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The core logic is sound, with no evident issues that would compromise security or functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and lacks malicious behavior.\n- The \"JSON parse error\" in the first report appears to be a parsing artifact, not an issue with the code itself.\n- The reports' assessments about minimal validation and potential for misuse are accurate but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** No report claims the code is malicious or obfuscated; all agree it's standard.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n**Malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely utility functions for proxy connections, with no signs of malware.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n\n- Reports assign a low risk (~0.1–0.2), citing potential misuse if malicious proxy URLs are used.\n- **Justification:** This is reasonable, as the code could be misused but does not contain inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores seem consistent and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions challenged:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the main risk is external—malicious proxy URLs or misconfiguration—not code-based vulnerabilities.\n- No claims of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — reflects potential misuse but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n**Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate for its intended purpose.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports' evaluations are accurate. The code is a standard, transparent implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with minimal validation. The potential security concerns are inherent to proxy usage, not the code itself. No malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, consistent with the reports and the code analysis.",
