  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with URL parsing and socket creation.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters (host, port), external socket wrapper classes",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection functions",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() extracts proxy details -> create_socket_wrapper() creates socket -> connect() establishes connection -> asyncio.open_connection() or create_connection() uses socket",
  "anomalies": "Minimal validation, reliance on external socket wrappers, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for proxy connection setup, with basic validation on host and port, and URL parsing. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is trusting external proxy URLs, which could be malicious, but this is inherent in proxy usage, not the code itself. Validation is minimal but standard for such utilities. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of proxy URLs supplied by users. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
