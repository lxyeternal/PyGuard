It performs basic validation on proxy URLs and inputs. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious code injections. The use of asyncio for network connections is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks are evident. The code relies on external socket wrappers and proxy type classes, which are assumed to be secure and trustworthy. The primary risk is if malicious proxies or URLs are provided, potentially redirecting traffic or intercepting data, but this aligns with expected proxy usage. No malware or backdoors are detected.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code implements standard proxy connection utilities with basic validation and no apparent malicious intent. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of provided proxy URLs and proxies, which is inherent in proxy configurations but does not indicate malicious code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
