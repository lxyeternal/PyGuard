  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It performs basic validation on inputs (host, port, proxy URL components).\n- It uses external libraries (`yarl`, `attr_property`) for URL parsing and proxy handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The main potential security concern is reliance on untrusted proxy URLs, which could redirect or intercept traffic, but this is inherent to proxy usage, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain obfuscated code, malware, or malicious payloads.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The validation is minimal but standard; no advanced security checks like DNS security validation are implemented, which is noted as a potential concern but not a flaw per se.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor issue is the minimal validation of proxy URLs, which could be exploited if malicious URLs are provided. However, this is typical for such utility code and not necessarily a flaw.\n- No logical errors or code bugs are apparent.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports — accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports — consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk scores:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk, which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The code's main risk is the trustworthiness of proxy URLs and proxies, not the code itself.\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** ~0.2 (consistent across reports)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No malware or malicious code detected.  \n- No obfuscation present.  \n- The potential security concern is the use of untrusted proxies, which is inherent in proxy configurations, not a flaw in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code is standard, straightforward, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The minor validation limitations are typical and do not constitute a security flaw.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent trust issues with proxy URLs, not code flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation for proxy connection handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment.",
