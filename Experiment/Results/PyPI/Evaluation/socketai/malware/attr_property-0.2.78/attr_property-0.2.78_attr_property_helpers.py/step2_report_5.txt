  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is designed to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), parsing proxy URLs, and creating socket wrappers.\n- It performs basic validation on inputs, such as checking host and port presence.\n- It uses standard libraries (`asyncio`, `socket`, `yarl`) and external classes (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`, `ProxyType`) assumed to be trustworthy.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The primary security concern is the potential misuse of untrusted proxy URLs, which could redirect or intercept traffic, but this is inherent to proxy usage, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Error:** JSON parse error (not relevant to code security).\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for SOCKS proxy connections, with minimal validation. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The risk score is low, reflecting potential misuse if malicious proxies are used, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1, standard proxy connection setup.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is straightforward and safe; the risk is inherent in proxy usage, not malicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same as above, standard implementation.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar, establishing proxy connections.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score; still reasonable given the code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same as others.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of proxy usage but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** Given the code's nature, I agree with 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher risk scores (e.g., 0.2) are justified due to the potential for misuse if malicious proxy URLs are supplied, but not because of malicious code.\n\n**However,** I would suggest that the risk score could be marginally increased to 0.3 if we consider the potential for malicious proxies to intercept or redirect traffic, especially if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk:** 0.2-0.3 (inherent proxy risks, no malicious intent).\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \nThe scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary unless a more conservative stance on proxy trustworthiness is desired.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the current assessment, possibly up to 0.3 if emphasizing potential misuse).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation for SOCKS proxy connections, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The primary concern remains the trustworthiness of proxy URLs, which is inherent in proxy configurations, not a flaw in the code itself.",
