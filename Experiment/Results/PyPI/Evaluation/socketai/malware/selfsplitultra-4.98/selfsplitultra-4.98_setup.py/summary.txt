  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated, and hidden execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state, strongly indicating malicious activity. The use of encoding, silent execution, and suspicious comments justify classifying this as malicious code with high security risk."
