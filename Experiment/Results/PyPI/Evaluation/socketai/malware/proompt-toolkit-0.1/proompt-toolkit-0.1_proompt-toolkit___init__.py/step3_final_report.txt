  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on static analysis signals.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic functions (`exec`, `eval`), obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, encoding techniques.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, malicious payload execution, network connections, environment variable access, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or dynamic execution functions leading to sinks like network communication or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation (high), dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`), misleading variable names, encoding, and ambiguous code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (score ~0.7), with dynamic execution functions indicating potential concealment of malicious activity. No explicit malicious payloads or suspicious network activity are confirmed, but the obfuscation and dynamic code suggest possible malicious intent. The malware score is increased to 0.4 for reports with high obfuscation, aligning with suspicion but lacking definitive evidence. Low confidence (0.6) due to static analysis limitations. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), reflecting suspicion without confirmed malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion of malicious intent. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but further dynamic or runtime analysis is recommended to conclusively determine malicious behavior.",
