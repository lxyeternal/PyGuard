      "conclusion": "The setup script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation and execution context justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm its purpose. Until then, treat this package with caution."
