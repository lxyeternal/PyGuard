  "purpose": "Utility class for handling colors, styles, and controls, with environment variable management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM'; input parameters for methods such as 'is_color_exist', 'is_style_exist', 'is_control_exist', 'convert_percentages', 'set_colorterm', and 'is_percentage'.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM' being set in 'set_colorterm'; data returned by 'convert_percentages' and 'is_percentage' functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and used within methods; 'set_colorterm' can set environment variable based on input or existing env; 'convert_percentages' translates percentage strings to color values; 'is_percentage' processes RGB tuple values, potentially calling 'convert_percentages'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of environment variable manipulation is standard, but setting 'COLORTERM' may influence terminal behavior. The 'convert_percentages' function creates a mapping for percentages to color values, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform validation of color, style, and control names, raising exceptions for invalid entries. Environment variable 'COLORTERM' is accessed and optionally set, which is typical for terminal color support configuration. The 'convert_percentages' function dynamically creates a percentage-to-value mapping for RGB colors, which is a standard approach. The 'is_percentage' method converts percentage strings to numeric values for RGB components. No suspicious data transmission, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. All operations are local and within expected behavior for a utility class handling terminal colors and styles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility class for managing terminal color configurations and style validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Environment variable setting is benign in context, and no external network activity or data exfiltration is observed.",
