  "purpose": "Utility class for managing colors, styles, and controls in a terminal-related context, including validation and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), input parameters for methods (colorterm, percent, name, numbers).",
  "sinks": "os.environ['COLORTERM'] (modification of environment variables).",
  "flows": "Method set_colorterm can read environment variable; convert_percentages reads from internal color mappings; is_color_exist, is_style_exist, is_control_exist raise exceptions if invalid; is_percentage converts percentage strings to numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns. Usage of environment variables is typical and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility class that manages color, style, and control validation with exception handling. It modifies environment variables but in a controlled, explicit manner. Conversion of percentages uses precomputed mappings; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are present. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for terminal color management. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It performs input validation and environment variable management safely. Overall, this code shows no signs of supply chain attack or malware.",
