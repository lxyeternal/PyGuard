  "sources": "os.getenv('COLORTERM'), os.environ['COLORTERM']",
  "sinks": "os.environ['COLORTERM']",
  "flows": "set_colorterm() reads environment variable; convert_percentages() uses internal mappings; is_color_exist() and other validation methods raise exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows observed. Use of environment variables is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation and conversion functions related to colors and styles. It reads environment variables for color support detection and raises exceptions on invalid inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The environment variable usage is standard for configuration purposes. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious sinks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for color/style validation with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for a terminal styling library.",
