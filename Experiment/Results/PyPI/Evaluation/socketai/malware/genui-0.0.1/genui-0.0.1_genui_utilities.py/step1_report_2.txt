  "purpose": "Utility class providing validation and conversion functions for color, style, and control attributes, as well as environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM' (via os.getenv), function arguments (colorterm, name, percent, numbers), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Setting environment variable 'COLORTERM' (os.environ['COLORTERM']) potentially affects process environment; raising exceptions for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated against internal dictionaries; environment variable is read and potentially modified; color percentages are converted based on internal calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network communications. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation and conversion of color, style, and control inputs, with environment variable handling for 'COLORTERM'. It uses exception raising for invalid inputs, which is normal for validation functions. The environment variable 'COLORTERM' is read and optionally set, which is standard for configuring terminal capabilities. No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. Functions operate solely within expected parameters without external data flow manipulations or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class focused on input validation and environment configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks within this module.",
