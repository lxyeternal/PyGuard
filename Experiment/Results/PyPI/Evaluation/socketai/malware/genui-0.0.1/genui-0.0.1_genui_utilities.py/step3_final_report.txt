  "purpose": "Utility class for terminal color, style, control validation, and environment variable management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters, environment variables, and internal dictionaries for validation.",
  "sinks": "Sets environment variable 'COLORTERM' and raises exceptions for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Validation functions process input, potentially modify environment variables, and perform conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, environment variable handling, and percentage conversions without any network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It raises exceptions on invalid inputs and manages environment variables in a typical manner for terminal configuration. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The environment variable 'COLORTERM' is read and set, which is common in terminal utilities but could influence terminal behavior. No external data exfiltration or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for terminal styling validation and configuration. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The environment variable handling is standard and does not pose security risks in this context.",
