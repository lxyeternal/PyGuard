  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing colors, styles, controls, and environment settings related to terminal color support.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM', method parameters, internal library data (e.g., Library.COLORS, Library.HEX_COLORS, etc.)",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting 'os.environ['COLORTERM']', data returned from conversions, exception raising (InvalidColor, InvalidStyle, InvalidControl)",
  "flows": "Reading 'COLORTERM' environment variable -> setting 'self.colorterm' -> using 'self.colorterm' in 'convert_percentages' -> potential usage in terminal color configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. The code only performs standard validation, environment variable handling, and conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Utilities class that manages color and style validation using data from an external Library module. It includes input validation methods ('is_color_exist', 'is_style_exist', 'is_control_exist') which raise custom exceptions if validation fails, but do not execute malicious actions. The 'convert_percentages' method translates percentage strings into numeric color values, referencing a colorterm setting. Environment variable 'COLORTERM' is read and set via 'set_colorterm', which could be used to influence terminal output, but this is standard practice. No data leakage, network operations, or suspicious behavior is present. The code uses exception handling to validate inputs, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for color and style validation and environment configuration. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It primarily performs input validation, environment variable handling, and conversions with no evident security risks.",
