{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal background color codes and RGB background sequences with dynamic attribute handling and error management.",
  "sources": "Reads color definitions from imported Library.COLORS; input parameters for rgb() and RGB() methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Uses color constants to generate escape sequences; input validation via Utilities.is_percentage ensures safe processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of vars() for dynamic attribute creation based on imported constants; __getattr__ override for invalid color handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color management, with dynamic attribute creation and error handling. No network, file, or secret data handling is present. The use of vars() is controlled and based on imported data, and __getattr__ raises exceptions for invalid colors. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are detected. Input validation via Utilities.is_percentage adds safety. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of terminal background color utilities with proper error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
