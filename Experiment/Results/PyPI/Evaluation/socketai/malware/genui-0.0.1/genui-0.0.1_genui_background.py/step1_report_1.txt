  "purpose": "Define classes for handling terminal background colors and color code utilities, including dynamic attribute handling for invalid colors.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions); class attributes and class variables; class methods rgb and RGB.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in rgb and RGB methods generate color code strings; potential exposure if untrusted input is used for color codes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters r, g, b pass through is_percentage utility, then used to generate color code strings; attribute access may trigger __getattr__ in MetaBack.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute generation with vars(), __getattr__ override raising exceptions for invalid colors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class structure for terminal color handling, including dynamic attribute assignment for color codes from a library. The MetaBack metaclass overrides __getattr__ to throw an exception for invalid colors, which is standard behavior. The Back class creates color escape sequences, with methods to generate RGB background codes, converting percentage inputs via a utility. The use of dynamic vars() for color names is normal, and no malicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of terminal color utilities with proper error handling for invalid colors. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The use of dynamic attribute handling and color code generation is standard and safe within this context.",
