{
  "purpose": "Define classes for handling terminal background colors, including dynamic attribute access and RGB color formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from .library, .utilities, .exceptions modules; class variables; method parameters.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for color codes; potential logging or output if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to methods (r, g, b) are processed and returned as formatted color code strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of dynamic vars() assignment is standard for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass to override attribute access for the class, raising custom exceptions on invalid colors. The Back class initializes color code mappings from a Library module, creating dynamic class attributes for each color. Methods rgb() and RGB() generate terminal color codes based on RGB inputs, utilizing utilities for percentage conversion. No external data inputs, network activity, or secret data handling is present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for terminal color handling with safe practices. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks identified. The design is typical for terminal color management modules.",
