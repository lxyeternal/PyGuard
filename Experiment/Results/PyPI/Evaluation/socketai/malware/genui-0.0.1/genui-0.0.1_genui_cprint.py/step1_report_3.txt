  "purpose": "Custom print function to output colored and styled text in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: fore_256, back_256, fore_rgb, back_rgb, formatting, line_color, reset, and additional kwargs for print.",
  "sinks": "Uses the built-in print function to output styled text. No direct data leaks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate styling strings, which are then printed. No external data flows or external system interactions detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs. The function appears to be a straightforward implementation for styled printing. The use of external modules for color handling is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a styled print function that leverages imported color handling utilities to output colored text. It processes input parameters to generate style strings and then calls the built-in print. No input is used in an unsafe or insecure manner. No network activity, data exfiltration, or command execution is present. The function is a utility for aesthetic purposes and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for printing styled text with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is consistent with typical styling functions and contains no suspicious elements.",
