  "purpose": "A utility function to print colored and styled text in the terminal, similar to the built-in print() function but with added color and style options.",
  "sources": "User-provided arguments: 'text', 'fore_256', 'back_256', 'fore_rgb', 'back_rgb', 'formatting', 'line_color', and additional kwargs for print().",
  "sinks": "The 'print()' function outputs to stdout. No other sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to determine style codes, which are then formatted and passed to the print() function. No external data sources or untrusted input streams are directly involved beyond function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of imported modules appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a styled print function with optional color parameters, using a 'Colored' class and functions 'foreground_rgb' and 'background_rgb' for color formatting. It processes color arguments and constructs a formatted string for printing. The logic is straightforward, with no apparent data leakage, network activity, or malicious intent. The code relies on external modules 'colored', which appear to be used for styling purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for styled terminal output, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
