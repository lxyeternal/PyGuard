  "purpose": "A utility function `cprint()` for printing styled, colored text to the terminal using external modules for color and style sequences.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as `text`, `fore_256`, `back_256`, `fore_rgb`, `back_rgb`, `formatting`, and `line_color`.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs styled text via `print()`, with no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate style sequences, which are then concatenated with the text and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present. External modules are presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward styled print utility, relying on external modules for color sequences. It processes input parameters to generate style strings, then outputs styled text. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The logic is correct, and the code is clear and well-structured. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for styled terminal output with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
