{
  "purpose": "A colored print function that formats text with colors and styles for console output.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'text' parameter, and optional color/style parameters such as fore_256, back_256, fore_rgb, back_rgb, formatting, and line_color.",
  "sinks": "Uses the built-in print() function for output; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate color codes, which are then combined with the text and printed; no untrusted data flow leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, using helper functions to generate color codes and a print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a stylized print function by leveraging external modules (.colored) to generate color attributes. It accepts various styling parameters and formats output accordingly. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data. It also does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. All external function calls are to presumed safe modules for color formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for styled console output. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply formats and prints text with color styles.",
