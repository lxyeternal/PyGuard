{
  "purpose": "The function provides enhanced printing capabilities with colored and styled text output for terminal display.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: text, fore_256, back_256, fore_rgb, back_rgb, formatting, line_color, reset, and additional keyword arguments (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the built-in print() function which outputs to the console; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate styled text strings, which are then passed directly to print(). There are no external data flows or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code is straightforward in applying color formatting and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling functions and defines cprint() to output colored text with optional styles. It processes color inputs and uses the Colored class for style attributes. It calls print() with the formatted string. No external or untrusted data is processed beyond input parameters; no code executes dynamically or accesses external resources. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious network activity, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a styled print utility for terminal output with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles input parameters to produce colored output without engaging in harmful activities.",
