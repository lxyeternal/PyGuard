  "purpose": "A customized print function that outputs colored and styled text to the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'text', 'fore_256', 'back_256', 'fore_rgb', 'back_rgb', 'formatting', 'line_color', 'reset', and additional keyword arguments (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement which outputs styled text to stdout; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate style codes, which are then concatenated and passed to 'print'. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The functions and variables are used for styling terminal output only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a styled printing function that leverages imported styling utilities from a local module. It processes input parameters to generate terminal style codes, then outputs styled text via the standard 'print' function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The code appears to be purely for aesthetic terminal output enhancement, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for styled terminal output. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
