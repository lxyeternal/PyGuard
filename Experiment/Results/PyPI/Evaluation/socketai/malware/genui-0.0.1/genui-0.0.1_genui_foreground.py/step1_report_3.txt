  "purpose": "Define color codes and utilities for terminal text styling, including dynamic attribute access for colors.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, class methods, and dynamic attribute generation in the Fore class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external communications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ in MetaFore to raise custom exceptions; dynamic attribute creation for color codes; no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color management. MetaFore overrides __getattr__ to raise an exception when an undefined attribute (color) is accessed, which is a controlled behavior for error handling. Fore class initializes color code variables dynamically from a library, providing methods to generate RGB color codes. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, or file manipulations. The code appears to be straightforward, primarily for styling terminal output. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for terminal color styling with custom attribute handling and no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
