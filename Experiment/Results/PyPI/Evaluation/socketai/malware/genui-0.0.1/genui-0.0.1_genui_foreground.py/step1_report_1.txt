{
  "purpose": "Define color formatting classes for terminal output, including dynamic color code generation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, and methods generating color codes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily constructs strings for terminal color sequences without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input to methods (e.g., rgb, RGB) flows through color code formatting, with no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Usage of class attribute overrides for AttributeError handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color output, with dynamic attribute setting based on a COLORS dictionary. The MetaFore class customizes attribute access, raising an exception if a nonexistent color is requested. The Fore class initializes various color codes and provides methods for RGB color formatting. No external data is processed, and no suspicious code flows or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for terminal color formatting with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It leverages standard Python features and follows typical patterns for such utilities.",
