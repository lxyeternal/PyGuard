{
  "purpose": "Defines a color utility class for terminal text styling, allowing dynamic color codes and RGB color formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Method calls (rgb, RGB) generate color code strings; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation via vars() and custom __getattr__ override; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class hierarchy for terminal color codes, utilizing external modules for configuration data. It employs dynamic attribute creation for color constants and custom attribute handling with exception raising. Methods for RGB color formatting convert input to terminal escape sequences, with no external data inputs or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are present. The use of dynamic attribute setting and exception handling appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for terminal color formatting with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
