{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for terminal text coloring using ANSI escape codes, with dynamic attribute handling and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attribute definitions, method parameters (r, g, b).",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted input directly leading to security issues or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (r, g, b) flow through methods rgb() and RGB(), but are only used to generate strings; no data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access with __getattr__, which raises exceptions for undefined colors; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for terminal color output with safe string formatting. It uses class attributes, class methods, and a metaclass to handle attribute errors. No external data sources or untrusted input processing present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The dynamic attribute handling is standard for such a library, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of terminal color management classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard patterns for such utilities, with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
