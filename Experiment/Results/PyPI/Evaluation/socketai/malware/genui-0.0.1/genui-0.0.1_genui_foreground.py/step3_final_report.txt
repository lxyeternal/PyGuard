{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal color formatting using ANSI escape sequences, dynamically creating color attributes from a predefined color dictionary, with error handling for invalid colors.",
  "sources": "Reads color definitions from Library.COLORS and input parameters for rgb() and RGB() methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Color attribute access from the class variables; rgb() and RGB() methods generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to raise custom exceptions for undefined colors; dynamic attribute creation with vars(). No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for terminal color formatting, employing standard Python features such as class variables, dynamic attribute creation, and a metaclass for error handling. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The use of __getattr__ for error handling is standard, and the RGB methods validate input via a utility function. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured terminal color utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
