  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'genui' to specify package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and the 'install_requires' list that specifies dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no code executes untrusted data or external inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks within this script.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns; only standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "This code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, including name, version, author, description, and dependencies. The only dependency specified is requests==2.31.0, which is a common third-party library. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data handling. The script performs a standard setup task without executing any untrusted code or data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, legitimate setup configuration for a Python package.",
