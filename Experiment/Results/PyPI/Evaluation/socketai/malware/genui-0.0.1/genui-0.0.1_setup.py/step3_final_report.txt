  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, calls find_packages(), and specifies install_requires with a fixed version of requests.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external data sources, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or external data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. It imports standard modules, defines package info, and specifies dependencies explicitly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The fixed dependency version is a common practice but does not introduce security risks. All signals indicate a benign, well-formed configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The code poses no supply chain or security threat.",
