  "sources": "setuptools.setup(), find_packages(), the install_requires list",
  "sinks": "Package installation process, dependency resolution",
  "flows": "N/A - standard setup process; no untrusted data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is minimal and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with basic package metadata and a single dependency 'requests==2.31.0'. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, or credential handling. The dependencies are explicitly specified. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The code performs a typical setup task for packaging a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package named 'genui'. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
