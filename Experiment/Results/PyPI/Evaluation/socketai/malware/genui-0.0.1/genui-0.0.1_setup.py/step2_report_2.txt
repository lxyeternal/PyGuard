  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The original code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- All reports consistently describe it as a typical, benign package configuration.\n- No dynamic code, untrusted input, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The dependencies are explicitly specified, with no obfuscation or code execution.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a slight mention that fixed dependencies might be a security best practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Discussion:** The securityRisk of 0.1 is perhaps marginal; since the code is static and straightforward, this could be reduced to 0.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is solid; the securityRisk score should be 0, not 0.1, as there's no evident risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms the script as benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the analysis; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no issues.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty.\n- The only minor inconsistency is in Report 2's securityRisk score, which should be 0, not 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 2's securityRisk from 0.1 to 0** to better reflect the benign nature.\n- **Overall malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the setup script is standard and has no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; only the second report's securityRisk should be lowered to 0. The code is safe, straightforward, and legitimate.",
