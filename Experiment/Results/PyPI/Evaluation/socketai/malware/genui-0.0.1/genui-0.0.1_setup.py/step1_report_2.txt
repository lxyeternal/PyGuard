  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'genui' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata, version, dependencies, author, and description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sinks are present; the code only specifies static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is straightforward package setup without data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The dependencies are explicitly specified with fixed versions, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package setup, including fixed version dependencies and package metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of fixed dependencies might be a security best practice but does not imply malicious intent. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
