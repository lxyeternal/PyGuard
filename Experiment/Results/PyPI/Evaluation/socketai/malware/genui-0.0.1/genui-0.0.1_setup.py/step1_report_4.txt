{
  "purpose": "To define package metadata and dependencies for the Python package 'genui' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data for package setup, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or points where input data influences code behavior in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration is static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools modules and defining package info such as name, version, packages, dependencies, author, and description. All values are hardcoded and typical for package configuration. No malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of 'find_packages()' and a specific dependency version is common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and standard.",
