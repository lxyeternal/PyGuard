{
  "purpose": "This code provides terminal styling and coloring functions, including handling Windows terminal modes, environment variable checks, and ANSI code generation for text styling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('FORCE_COLOR', 'NO_COLOR'), checks terminal TTY status (sys.stdout, sys.stderr), and platform info. Uses imported modules for color and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling; no direct data leaks or network connections are present. No insecure database or command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence TTY awareness and color support decisions. Color/style functions generate escape sequences based on input and environment. No data flows into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no backdoors, or hidden network activities. The only complex logic involves Windows terminal mode setting, which is legitimate system API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up terminal styling functions, manages environment variable overrides for color support, and attempts to enable Windows terminal processing via system calls. It uses platform and TTY detection to decide whether to enable colors. The code imports external modules that are assumed benign. No suspicious data handling, no network activities, and no malicious code execution paths are observed. The functions are designed for terminal text styling and are consistent with legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard terminal styling utility with proper handling of environment variables, platform-specific features, and ANSI codes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code segment.",
