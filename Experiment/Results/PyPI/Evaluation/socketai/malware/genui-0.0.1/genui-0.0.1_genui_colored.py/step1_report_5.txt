{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal styling functions, including color and style codes, and manages Windows terminal compatibility and environment-based enabling/disabling of styles.",
  "sources": "Imports modules os, sys, platform, and internal modules for library, hexadecimal, and utilities. Reads environment variables FORCE_COLOR and NO_COLOR. Reads system information via platform.system().",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables to determine color support. No direct untrusted input handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> functions like enabled() -> global TTY_AWARE -> style functions -> terminal output styling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The only notable behavior is environment-based control of styling, which is standard. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal color styles and compatibility across platforms. It uses standard Python libraries, platform info, and environment variables for configuration. There are no indications of malicious data handling, external network communication, or covert operations. The functions are focused on styling terminal output with no apparent malicious intent or sabotage. The only potential concern is the environment variable reliance for enabling/disabling features, which is typical for such tools. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate terminal styling utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It uses environment variables and system info for configuration, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malware, malicious data leaks, or sabotage.",
