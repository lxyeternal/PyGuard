{
  "purpose": "Terminal styling, platform-specific handling, environment variable checks, and ANSI code generation for colored output.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), system API calls via ctypes for Windows console mode, input parameters for styling functions.",
  "sinks": "ANSI escape sequences sent to stdout/stderr, system API calls to modify console modes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence color enabling; system API calls modify console mode; styling functions generate ANSI codes based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of ctypes for Windows console mode is standard for enabling ANSI support.",
  "analysis": "The code provides terminal styling utilities with platform-specific handling and environment variable controls. It uses standard system API calls to enable ANSI sequences on Windows, which is common practice. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. Environment variables are used for configuration, not malicious purposes. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature and low inherent risk of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign terminal styling utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The current security scores are justified and should be maintained.",
