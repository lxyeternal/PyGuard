  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for terminal styling and color management, including enabling Windows terminal modes, and defining functions to generate ANSI escape sequences for styling console output.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), sys.stdout.isatty(), imported modules, and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequences for styling terminal output; potential use of environment variables; internal functions that could be invoked with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> style/fore/back functions -> escape sequence generation -> output to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code's main functionality revolves around styling terminal output, which is benign. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed. The presence of environment variable checks and platform-specific terminal mode adjustments is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class for terminal text styling with methods to generate ANSI escape sequences, manage Windows terminal modes, and check environment variables that influence color support. It imports standard modules and internal libraries but does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or system modifications. The functions and class methods are focused on styling terminal output and do not contain code that could be used maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module for terminal styling with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility for terminal styling and color management. It performs environment checks and platform-specific adjustments to enable color output in terminals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is well-structured, and its purpose is benign.",
