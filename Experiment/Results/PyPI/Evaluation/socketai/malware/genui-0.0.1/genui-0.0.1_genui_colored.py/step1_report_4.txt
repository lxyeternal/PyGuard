{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for styling terminal output with colors and text styles, including support for Windows terminals and environment-based color control.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('FORCE_COLOR', 'NO_COLOR') and checks terminal TTY status (sys.stdout.isatty(), sys.stderr.isatty()). It also reads from imported modules (Library, Hex, Utilities).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. The code generates escape sequences for styling output and does not process external input data into critical functions like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and TTY status influence whether styling is enabled. Methods generate ANSI codes based on internal state and environment, with no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are present. The environment variable checks are standard for terminal styling; no backdoors or malicious control flows are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manages terminal styling through ANSI escape sequences, checking environment variables to control color output, and enabling Windows terminal modes. It uses static and instance methods for configuration and styling. No external data or network communication is involved, and all logic appears standard for terminal styling purposes. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious code are detected. The code relies on environment variables and TTY checks, which are common in such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign terminal styling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely manages terminal output styling based on environment and terminal capabilities, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
