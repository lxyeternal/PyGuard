  "purpose": "Terminal cursor control using ANSI escape sequences with input validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name', 'row', 'column'; external modules 'Library' and 'Utilities' for constants and validation.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for escape sequences; validation checks; exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> control existence check -> string formatting -> return escape sequence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation and string formatting; reliance on external modules assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types and control existence, then constructs ANSI escape sequences accordingly. It performs no network, file, or system modifications. External modules are used for constants and validation, but their safety cannot be confirmed from this fragment. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The escape sequences are standard for terminal control. The validation and exception handling are appropriate. The code's simplicity and lack of external threats suggest minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for terminal cursor control with proper validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. External dependencies are assumed safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1).",
