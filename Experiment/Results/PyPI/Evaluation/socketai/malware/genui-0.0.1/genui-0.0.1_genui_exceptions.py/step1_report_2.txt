  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid input related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or to external systems; solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'super(Exception, self)' instead of 'super().__init__()' is unusual but not malicious; no code injection or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes with messages, intended for validation errors. There are no external data reads, no data leaks, no unsafe operations, and no malicious code. The implementation is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended for error handling purposes.",
