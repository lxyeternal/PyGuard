{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various invalid input scenarios related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data output targets involved; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) is unconventional; typically super().__init__(message) is used. No other suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with straightforward __init__ and __str__ methods. No input handling, network operations, file access, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with standard exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely functional for exception handling. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
