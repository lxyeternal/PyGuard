  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes with straightforward __init__ and __str__ methods.\n   - No data processing, input reading, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The only minor concern is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`, which is unconventional but not malicious. It could cause runtime errors but does not introduce security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - They note the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self)` but correctly conclude this is a coding mistake, not malicious.\n   - No reports mention any signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting the thoroughness of the analysis.\n   - The only minor discrepancy is report 5, which assigns a confidence of 0.9 due to the super() misuse, but this is a coding mistake, not a security issue.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n   - The only \"issue\" is the incorrect use of super(), which is a coding error, not a security flaw.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes.\n- The only notable flaw is the incorrect use of `super()`, which should be corrected but does not pose security risks.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence level can be considered 1, given the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with a minor coding mistake that does not impact security.
