{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various input validation errors related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ methods of exception classes, specifically the 'message' string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that could cause security issues or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input messages provided to exception constructors are stored and returned via __str__, with no data flow leading to system effects or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Exception class definitions are standard; no unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, each initializing with a message string and overriding __str__ to return that message. There are no data sources from untrusted inputs beyond the constructor parameters, which are typical for exception handling. No network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code appears straightforward, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines simple custom exception classes for input validation errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and standard for input validation handling.",
