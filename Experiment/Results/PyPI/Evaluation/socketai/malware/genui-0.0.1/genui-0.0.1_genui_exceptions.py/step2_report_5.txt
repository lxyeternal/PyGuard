  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the correctness of the scores, and whether any security concerns are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes, with no data processing, external input/output, or suspicious behavior.\n- The primary technical issue noted is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the correct `super().__init__(message)` in Python 3, which could cause runtime errors but is not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is just class definitions for custom exceptions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues with the scoring.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, consistent and correct.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the code is only class definitions, with no external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero, confidence = 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly points out the minor mistake in the use of `super()`. While this could cause runtime errors, it does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The mistake is a coding error, not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, the code is benign; the only issue is a minor coding mistake, not a security risk.\n\n**My own assessment aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe only technical note is the incorrect use of `super()` which could cause runtime errors but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The minor mistake in the use of `super()` is a coding error, not a security concern.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with only a minor syntax issue that should be corrected for proper Python 3 compatibility.",
