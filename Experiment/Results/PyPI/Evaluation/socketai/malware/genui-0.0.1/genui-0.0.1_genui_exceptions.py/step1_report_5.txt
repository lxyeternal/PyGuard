  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various invalid input/error conditions related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling present).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no data inputs or processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Super().__init__(message) is used incorrectly; should be super().__init__(message). The current implementation may cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with consistent structure. Each class has an __init__ method that calls super() with the message and assigns it to self.message. However, the use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) is incorrect; it should be super().__init__(message). There are no data inputs, external dependencies, or suspicious behaviors. The code is purely structural and for exception handling, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with a minor mistake in the use of super(). It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The primary issue is a coding error that may cause runtime exceptions but does not affect security.",
