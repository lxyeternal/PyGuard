  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class instantiation with messages.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, no external communication, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with messages; no data flow beyond object creation.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super() in __init__ methods (`super(Exception, self).__init__(message)`), which may cause runtime errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions with standard __init__ and __str__ methods. The only technical flaw is the unconventional super() call, which is a coding mistake, not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. The code does not perform any external communication, data processing, or dynamic execution. Given the benign nature, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of exception classes with a minor coding error in super() usage. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assigned scores are appropriate; only the super() call should be corrected for proper Python 3 compatibility.",
