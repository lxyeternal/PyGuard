  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various invalid input errors related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading operations present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to untrusted sources; no potentially dangerous data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes without any data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hidden code execution, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from Exception and initializing with a message string. The __init__ methods incorrectly call super(Exception, self).__init__(message), which should be super().__init__(message) in Python 3, but this is a standard pattern and not malicious. No data handling, input reading, or external communications are present. The code appears to be a straightforward definition of exception classes intended for use elsewhere.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions, and it does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign set of custom exception class definitions for input validation errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious code features.",
