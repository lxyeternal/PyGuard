  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines four custom exception classes, each inheriting from `Exception`.\n- Each class's `__init__` method calls `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` and assigns `self.message`.\n- The `__str__` method returns `self.message`.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, intended for error handling in a larger application.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** All four reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Anomalies:** The only noted anomaly is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the more conventional `super().__init__(message)`. This is a stylistic or minor implementation issue, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, but notes the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)`. This could cause runtime errors but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that this is a coding mistake, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of malicious code or behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious intent, and the code only defines exception classes.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree it should be zero.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as no external data handling, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only technical issue is the incorrect use of `super()` which could lead to runtime errors but not security issues.\n- Given the purpose of the code, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, simple, and intended solely for exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions with a minor implementation flaw in the use of `super()`. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
