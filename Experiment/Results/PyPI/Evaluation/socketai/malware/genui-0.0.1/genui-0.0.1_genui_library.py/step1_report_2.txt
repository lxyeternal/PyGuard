{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'Library' containing constants and mappings related to terminal colors, control sequences, and styles for formatting terminal output.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code primarily defines static constants and dictionaries.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources or outputs; no data processing or input/output flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Contains extensive color and style mappings but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a comprehensive set of constants for terminal styling, including ANSI escape sequences, color mappings in various formats, and control sequences. There are no dynamic elements, no external data input/output, and no functions that process untrusted data. The purpose appears to be purely for styling terminal output with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, non-malicious collection of styling constants and dictionaries for terminal color and style control. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
