{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dataclass containing various constants related to terminal color codes, control sequences, and environment variable values, likely for use in terminal or console formatting.",
  "sources": "The class variables that hold constant strings and dictionaries, including environment variable definitions and color codes.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects; no network operations, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code purely contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of static data structures and constant values. No dynamic execution, user input processing, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data structure encapsulating terminal control sequences, color values, and environment variable mappings. It does not perform any data input/output, network operations, or system commands. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The content appears to be a straightforward, well-organized collection of constants for terminal styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a collection of constants related to terminal formatting. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It is a standard utility module for terminal styling with no security concerns.",
