{
  "purpose": "Define a collection of ANSI escape sequences, control codes, color values, and environment-related constants for terminal styling and coloring.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and class-level dictionaries containing static data; no external input or data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code solely defines static data structures without runtime data manipulation or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of static definitions and data structures; no suspicious, hidden, or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data container class for terminal color codes and control sequences. It uses dataclasses with default values and static dictionaries to store color and control code mappings. No functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic behaviors are present. It appears to serve as a utility for terminal styling without any malicious or suspicious logic. There is no indication of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or covert activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module defining terminal styling constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be intended for use in terminal-based applications requiring styled output.",
