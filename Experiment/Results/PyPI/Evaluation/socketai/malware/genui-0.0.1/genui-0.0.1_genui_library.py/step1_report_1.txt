{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data class for managing terminal color and control sequences, including color codes, control sequences, and environment variable values.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources are read from external inputs or untrusted sources; the code only defines static constants and mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked; the code contains only static data definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or execute dynamic data or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic is present. The code consists of static constants, dictionaries, and class attributes with fixed string and numeric values.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a data class 'Library' with color codes, control sequences, environment variable values, and color mappings. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code logic. The use of static data structures and constants is typical for terminal formatting libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration or utility class for terminal color and control sequences. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no evident security risks.",
