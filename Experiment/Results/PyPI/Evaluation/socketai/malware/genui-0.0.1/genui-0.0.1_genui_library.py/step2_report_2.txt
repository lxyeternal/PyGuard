  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, benign collection of constants, mappings, and style definitions for terminal control sequences and colors.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted inputs are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be purely for styling terminal output, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Code Confirmation:**\n- The code does not process any dynamic data, user input, or external sources.\n- It contains only static class attributes, dictionaries, and constants.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, clear code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there's no security concern.\n\n**Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified.\n- No need to adjust scores; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Justification for Scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 reflects the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 indicates no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score of 0 is correct because the code is purely static and utility-oriented.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility class for terminal styling.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores given are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
