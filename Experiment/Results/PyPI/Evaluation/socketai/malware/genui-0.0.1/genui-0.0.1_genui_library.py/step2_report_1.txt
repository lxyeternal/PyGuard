  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely a static data class (`Library`) containing constants, dictionaries, and color codes related to terminal styling.\n   - No external data input, output, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n   - The code appears to serve as a utility for terminal formatting, with no malicious intent.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, static, and contains no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute dynamic logic.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and only defines constants, there are no assumptions about dynamic behavior or external data.\n   - No concerns about code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic are warranted here.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analyses provided.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation & Personal Estimation:**\n   - The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n   - The high confidence scores (1 or 1.0) across reports are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a straightforward, static collection of constants for terminal styling. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or contain any malicious logic. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No further security review or mitigation is necessary.\n- It should be considered a benign utility module with no security concerns.",
