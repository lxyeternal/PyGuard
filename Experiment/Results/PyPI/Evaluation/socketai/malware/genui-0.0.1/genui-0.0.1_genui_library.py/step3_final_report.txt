  "purpose": "Static collection of terminal styling constants, color codes, and control sequences for terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data input, environment variables, or dynamic data; static class attributes and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data class containing constants, dictionaries, and color mappings related to terminal styling. It does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The high confidence score reflects certainty of its harmless intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
