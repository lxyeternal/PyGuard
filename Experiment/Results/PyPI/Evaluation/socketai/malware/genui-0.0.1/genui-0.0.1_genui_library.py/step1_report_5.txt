{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class 'Library' containing constants and dictionaries related to terminal color codes, control sequences, and environment variable mappings for terminal styling and color management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only initializes static class variables and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets beyond color codes, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dataclass with various class variables, dictionaries, and constants related to terminal color and control sequences. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network activity. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The content appears to be a utility module for terminal styling purposes, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of constants for terminal styling and color management. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. It is a benign utility module.",
