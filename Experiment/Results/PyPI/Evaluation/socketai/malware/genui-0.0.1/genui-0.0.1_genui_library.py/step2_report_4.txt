  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a static collection of constants, dictionaries, and class attributes related to terminal styling.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or input/output flows are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose appears purely to facilitate terminal coloring and control sequences.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, indicating benign intent.\n\n**Confirmations & Logical Consistency:**\n- The code is a data class with static constants and dictionaries, no functions, no input/output, no external dependencies.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The extensive color mappings and control sequences are typical for terminal styling libraries.\n\n**Potential Flaws or Concerns:**\n- The only minor concern could be the sheer size and comprehensiveness of the color dictionaries, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no security risk.\n\n**Justification for Scores:**\n- The code is purely static, with no runtime data processing or external interactions.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert activities.\n- The extensive static data does not increase risk; it merely provides configuration constants.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, static collection of terminal styling constants with no security concerns. The detailed color and control sequence mappings are typical for terminal utility libraries and do not pose any threat.",
