  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded, obfuscated PowerShell code executed during setup, which appears malicious due to obfuscation, external URL, and hidden execution. This behavior indicates a high security threat, warranting further decoding and analysis of the payload. The overall risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious."
