  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The behavior aligns with supply chain sabotage tactics. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive assessment. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious."
