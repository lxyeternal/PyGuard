  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on code structure and signals.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, stdin, external modules, network requests, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data processing, environment variables, stdin, external modules, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or stdin feed into processing functions; data fetched from external URLs or input sources are processed locally; no suspicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as utilizing common input sources (environment variables, stdin, command-line args) and performing typical data processing or network requests. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The confidence in benignity is high, and the lack of suspicious signals supports low malware and obfuscation scores. The risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting cautious assessment due to untrusted input sources but no evidence of malicious intent. The reasoning is consistent with the provided descriptions, and no code snippets indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
