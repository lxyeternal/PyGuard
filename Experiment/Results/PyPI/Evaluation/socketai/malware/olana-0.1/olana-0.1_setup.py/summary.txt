  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing extensive obfuscation to conceal its intent. It performs system modifications, package installations, and privilege checks that could be exploited for system compromise or persistence. The high obfuscation, combined with system API calls and dynamic execution, confirms malicious intent. It should be classified as malicious or highly dangerous."
