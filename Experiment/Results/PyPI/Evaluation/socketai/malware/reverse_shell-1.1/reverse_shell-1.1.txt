It should be classified as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The package should be avoided, and further analysis of the external script is recommended."

The high malware score of 0.9 and risk score of 0.9 are appropriate. The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is straightforward but malicious. Overall, this code should be considered malicious with high confidence."

The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with these indicators. It should be treated as malicious unless further analysis of 'bypass.py' reveals benign intent."
