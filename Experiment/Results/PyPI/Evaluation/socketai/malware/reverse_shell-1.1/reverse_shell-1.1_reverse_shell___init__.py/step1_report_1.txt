{
  "purpose": "The code clones a GitHub repository and executes a script from it, while also sending a notification to a Discord webhook indicating the package was installed.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from the GitHub repository URL and the environment (file system). The webhook URL and repository URL are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL in send_discord_info(), subprocess.run() executing 'bypass.py', and cloning operations act as sinks where data is sent or code is executed.",
  "flows": "Repository URL and local paths are used for cloning, then the cloned script ('bypass.py') is executed. The Discord webhook URL receives a message about installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically clones an external repository and runs its script without validation. The webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible, indicating potential malicious intent. The function send_discord_info is defined twice, once imported and once redefined, which is suspicious. The repository URL suggests possible malicious activity, especially given the message about a 'reverse_shell'.",
  "analysis": "The script's main behavior involves cloning an external repository from GitHub and executing a script within it, which could contain malicious code such as a reverse shell or other malware. The send_discord_info() function is used to notify via Discord that the package has been installed, implying possible stealthy or malicious tracking. The hardcoded webhook and repository URLs are dangerous, as they point to external servers controlled by an attacker. The redefinition of send_discord_info() after import suggests obfuscation or malicious intent to mask the real behavior. The overall flow indicates that this code could be used to deploy malicious scripts or establish backdoors after installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious potential. It clones and executes external code without validation, communicates with external servers, and has suspicious structure (e.g., redefined functions). The presence of a reverse shell mention and external repository strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for establishing unauthorized access or backdoors.",
