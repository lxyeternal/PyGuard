{
  "purpose": "The code clones an external GitHub repository, executes a script from it, and sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating the package was installed, with indicators of malicious intent such as referencing 'reverse_shell'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URLs for the webhook and repository, reading from the filesystem during clone, executing 'bypass.py' via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Network POST request to Discord webhook, execution of external script 'bypass.py', potential data exfiltration or remote control via the executed script.",
  "flows": "Cloning repository from URL -> changing directory -> executing 'bypass.py' -> sending notification via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of 'send_discord_info()' after import, hardcoded URLs, executing unverified external code without validation, messaging referencing 'reverse_shell'.",
  "analysis": "The code clones an external repository and executes a script without validation, indicating potential malicious activity. The redefinition of 'send_discord_info()' is suspicious, possibly obfuscation or malicious masking. Hardcoded URLs and messaging referencing 'reverse_shell' suggest malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with deploying a backdoor or reverse shell, and external communication could lead to data exfiltration. The lack of validation, error handling, or integrity checks further increases risk. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, including remote code execution, external communication, and potential backdoor deployment. The high malware score of 0.9 and risk score of 0.9 are appropriate. The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is straightforward but malicious. Overall, this code should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
