{
  "purpose": "The code clones a GitHub repository, executes a script from it, and sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating the package's installation, potentially as part of a reverse shell or backdoor setup.",
  "sources": "User input includes the repository URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') and the webhook URL; the latter is hardcoded. The code reads the filesystem to check for existing directories. It does not read external untrusted data dynamically at runtime beyond these hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sending POST request to the Discord webhook (sending data externally), executing 'python bypass.py' via subprocess (potentially running malicious code from the cloned repository).",
  "flows": "Clones repository from the hardcoded URL → changes working directory → runs 'bypass.py' → sends notification to Discord webhook after execution.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning an external repository and executing a script from it without validation, hardcoded webhook and repository URLs, sending notification upon installation, which may serve as a backdoor or control beacon, no validation of 'bypass.py' content.",
  "analysis": "The script clones a remote repository from a hardcoded URL, which could contain malicious code. It then runs a script ('bypass.py') from that repository without any checks or validation, potentially executing malicious payloads. After execution, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating the package was installed, which could be used for monitoring or controlling infected systems. The use of subprocess to execute an external script is a significant risk if the remote content is malicious. The code does not perform any input validation, error handling, or security checks. The combination of remote code execution and notification suggests malicious intent, such as establishing a reverse shell or backdoor and reporting to an attacker.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by cloning and executing external code from a remote repository without validation and notifying an external service of installation. These actions are characteristic of a backdoor or remote control setup, indicating high malicious intent.",
