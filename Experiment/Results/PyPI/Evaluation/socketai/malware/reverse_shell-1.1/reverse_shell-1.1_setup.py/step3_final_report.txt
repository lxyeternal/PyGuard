{
  "purpose": "The code clones an external repository, executes a script from it, and sends a notification via a hardcoded Discord webhook, indicating malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "sources": "The repository URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git'), the 'bypass.py' script, and the Discord webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'bypass.py' via subprocess, sending POST request to the Discord webhook, and the setup process itself.",
  "flows": "The code clones the repository, changes directory into it, runs 'bypass.py', and then sends a notification, all during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "Cloning and executing external code without validation, hardcoded webhook URL with suspicious message, and performing these actions during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cloning of an external repository, executes a script ('bypass.py') without validation, and sends a notification to a hardcoded Discord webhook. These behaviors are typical of malicious supply chain attacks or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the actions are suspicious and potentially dangerous. The high likelihood of malicious intent is supported by the external code execution, stealth notification, and naming ('reverse_shell'). The scores in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified given these behaviors. The code could facilitate remote code execution, data exfiltration, or establishing reverse shells, posing a high security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, involving remote code execution, external repository cloning, and stealth notifications. It should be classified as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The package should be avoided, and further analysis of the external script is recommended.",
