{
  "purpose": "Clone a remote GitHub repository, execute an external script ('bypass.py'), and send a notification indicating a 'reverse_shell' installation.",
  "sources": "Repository URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git'), local directory for cloning, 'bypass.py' script, Discord webhook URL",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'bypass.py' via subprocess, sending POST request to Discord webhook with malicious message",
  "flows": "Clone repository from remote URL -> change directory to cloned repo -> execute 'bypass.py' -> send Discord notification",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL exposed in code, execution of external script without validation, message referencing 'reverse_shell', no validation or sanitization of external code",
  "analysis": "The code clones an external repository and executes a script ('bypass.py') without validation, which could contain malicious payloads. It also sends a notification to a hardcoded Discord webhook indicating a 'reverse_shell' installation, a common malicious indicator. The straightforward code structure and explicit messaging suggest malicious intent, especially given the context of remote code execution and potential backdoor setup. The high malware score (0.9) and security risk (0.9) are justified by these behaviors. The code does not obfuscate its logic, and the exposed webhook URL could facilitate data exfiltration or attacker notification. The overall pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or remote backdoor deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors strongly indicative of malicious activity, including remote code execution, unvalidated external script execution, and attacker notification via exposed webhook. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with these indicators. It should be treated as malicious unless further analysis of 'bypass.py' reveals benign intent.",
