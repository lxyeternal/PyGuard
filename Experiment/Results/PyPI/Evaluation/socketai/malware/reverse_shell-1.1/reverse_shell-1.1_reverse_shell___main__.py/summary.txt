  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors strongly indicative of malicious activity, including remote code execution, unvalidated external script execution, and attacker notification via exposed webhook. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with these indicators. It should be treated as malicious unless further analysis of 'bypass.py' reveals benign intent."
