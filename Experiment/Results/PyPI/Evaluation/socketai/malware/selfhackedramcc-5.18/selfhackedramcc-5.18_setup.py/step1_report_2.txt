{
  "purpose": "The script is primarily designed to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedramcc' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of the 'tahg' directory, and attempts to execute a PowerShell command if the directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which could potentially be malicious or maliciously obfuscated if decoded and analyzed.",
  "flows": "The code checks for a directory; if not present, it executes a hidden PowerShell command. The setup configuration is standard and unlikely to contribute to malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded PowerShell command intended to run silently, possibly for malicious purposes. The command's content is encoded, making immediate analysis difficult. The URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') may be suspicious. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "Initially, the code imports setup tools and tries to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if the directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and run a file from a suspicious URL. The setup() call is standard, defining package metadata for 'selfhackedramcc' with dependencies. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which could hide issues or malicious failures. The embedded PowerShell command is the most suspicious part, indicating possible malicious activity such as downloading or executing external payloads silently.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a potentially malicious PowerShell command encoded in base64, likely used to download and execute a remote payload. This, combined with the hidden execution and error suppression, suggests malicious intent. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the embedded command raises security concerns.",
