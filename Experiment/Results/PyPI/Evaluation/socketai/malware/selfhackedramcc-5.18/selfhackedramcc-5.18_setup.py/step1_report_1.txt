{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedramcc' and attempts to run some potentially malicious code if a certain directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reads the existence of directory 'tahg' and attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a PowerShell command which could be used to download or run malicious payloads",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> if not exists, executes PowerShell command -> potentially downloading or executing malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded URL within the encoded PowerShell command, attempt to run hidden PowerShell process, absence of any legitimate reason for executing this command in a setup script",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils and tries to import subprocess and os. If 'tahg' directory does not exist, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command hidden via subprocess with no window. This command is suspicious as it targets a specific URL, suggesting possible malicious intent such as downloading payloads or establishing remote control. The setup function appears standard, but the initial code behavior indicates potential malicious activity. The exception handling silently ignores errors, which could hide failures. Overall, the core malicious behavior is the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command without clear legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior with a hidden PowerShell command that could be used for malicious purposes. While the setup process itself appears standard, the initial code's intent and actions raise concerns about executing remote or harmful code, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity.",
