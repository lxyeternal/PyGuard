      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command triggered during package setup. The presence of a suspicious URL and stealthy execution strongly suggest a supply chain attack or backdoor. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating a high security threat. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for definitive analysis, but current evidence warrants treating this as malicious."
