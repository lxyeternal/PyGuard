  "purpose": "This code outputs a simple greeting message and serves as a benign example with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or dependencies; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial print statement with no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security threat or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.",
