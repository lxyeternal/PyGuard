  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' with no external dependencies or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single print statement with no input, data flow, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No issues or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no threat, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
