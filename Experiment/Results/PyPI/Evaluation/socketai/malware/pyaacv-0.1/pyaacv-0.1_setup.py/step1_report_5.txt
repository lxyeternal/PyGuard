{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest and uses subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and open the file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run calls execute PowerShell commands that download and launch an external executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the source URL download through subprocess commands to open the downloaded file, which could execute malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic download and execution of an external executable during package installation, which is not typical for standard Python packages. No validation or user prompt is present before executing external code. Use of hardcoded URL and execution of downloaded file without verification are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command in setuptools to perform additional actions. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an executable from a suspicious URL and then attempts to run it. The download and execution happen automatically during installation, which could lead to remote code execution. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file, nor does it inform the user beforehand. This behavior is highly atypical and potentially malicious, as it can run arbitrary code from an external source without user consent. The approach used here is indicative of malicious supply chain behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without user consent or verification. This pattern resembles supply chain attacks, and the intent appears malicious. It is highly dangerous and should be removed or replaced with secure, verified installation procedures.",
