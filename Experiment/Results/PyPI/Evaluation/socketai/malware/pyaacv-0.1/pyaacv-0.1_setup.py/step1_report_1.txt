{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "Download URL in 'Invoke-WebRequest' command, output file path, and the execution command 'Start-Process'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'Start-Process', potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Download from external URL → save as 'CBLines.exe' → execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of a package installation process to download and execute an external executable. The URL points to a raw file on GitHub, which may be malicious. The code executes the downloaded file without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setup.py install command to download an external executable from a GitHub raw URL. It then attempts to open and run this executable using PowerShell commands. The download and execution occur automatically during package installation, which is suspicious. There is no validation, checksum, or user confirmation before running the external file. Such behavior can be exploited to deliver malware or perform malicious actions on the target system. The script does not perform any security checks or sanitization of the downloaded file. The approach indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic for supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation or user consent. It strongly suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious activity that could compromise system security.",
