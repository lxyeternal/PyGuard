{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' used in Invoke-WebRequest within the run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via Start-Process, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code downloads the executable from the remote URL and then runs it directly, establishing a source-to-sink flow from URL download to execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during package installation without any validation or user consent. No security checks or verification steps are present. The code uses PowerShell commands in a way that could be malicious, especially since the executable is hosted on a third-party site and executed immediately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, downloads a binary file from a remote URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. It then checks if the download was successful and proceeds to open (execute) the file with Start-Process. This behavior is highly suspicious because it downloads and executes code during installation, which is a common tactic for delivering malware. There are no checks for file integrity, authentication, or user consent. The code runs external commands with shell=True, increasing the risk of command injection if the URL or filenames are manipulated. Overall, this pattern strongly indicates malicious intent or at least risky behavior, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious-like behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without verification or user approval. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malicious payload delivery, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
