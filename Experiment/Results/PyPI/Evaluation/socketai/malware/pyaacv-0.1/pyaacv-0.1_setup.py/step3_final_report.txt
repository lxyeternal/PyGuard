{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during package installation and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent or supply chain attack behavior.",
  "sources": "The download occurs via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest embedded in subprocess.run; the executable is saved to the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is executed immediately with Start-Process, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Input source: remote URL via PowerShell command; sink: execution of the downloaded file with Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate download and execution of an external file during package installation without validation, user consent, or checksum verification; use of shell=True with subprocess; no validation of the executable.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform a remote download of an executable file from a suspicious URL, then executes it without any validation or user interaction. It uses PowerShell commands embedded within Python subprocess calls with shell=True, increasing risk. The pattern resembles supply chain malware delivery, with high potential for system compromise. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but malicious in behavior. The behavior aligns with known malicious patterns, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The lack of validation, combined with automatic execution, makes this highly dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without validation. It should be classified as highly malicious, with malware and security risk scores set to 1.0. The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
