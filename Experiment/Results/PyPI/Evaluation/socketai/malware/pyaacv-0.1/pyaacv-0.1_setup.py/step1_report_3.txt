{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download a file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a downloaded file by opening it with Start-Process, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Download command (source) -> downloaded file saved locally -> execution command (opening the file) (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a URL during install and immediately executing it is unusual and suspicious behavior; no validation or verification of the file is performed; use of PowerShell commands embedded in Python code; no signs of obfuscation but the intent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the installation command to perform a network download of an executable file from a GitHub URL. It then attempts to open and execute this file using PowerShell commands. This behavior is atypical for legitimate package installation scripts and indicates potential malicious intent. The process involves retrieving an external payload and executing it without validation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The code does not use any encryption or obfuscation but performs actions that are highly suspicious for supply chain attacks or malware delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, which poses a significant security risk. It likely aims to compromise systems through supply chain attack vectors or malware distribution. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
