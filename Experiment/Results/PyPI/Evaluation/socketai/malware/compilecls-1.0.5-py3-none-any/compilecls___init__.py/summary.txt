  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, performing extensive data exfiltration, process manipulation, injection, and evasion techniques. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; malware score should be 1.0, obfuscation around 0.4, and security risk at 1.0, reflecting the high threat level. The code's behavior aligns with high-confidence malicious activity, warranting immediate containment and removal."
