{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user information such as passwords, cookies, tokens, browsing history, system information, and clipboard data from a compromised system, and exfiltrate this data via webhooks or upload it to external services. It also manipulates browser data, injects scripts into Discord, and includes anti-analysis measures.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), local files (browsers' local storage, cookies, passwords, history, local state files), process enumerations, user clipboard, and network responses (e.g., IP info, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into webhook endpoints via HTTP requests, into files (logs, password dumps, cookies), and into external upload services. It also executes commands to kill processes, injects scripts into Discord, and manipulates system files, potentially causing malicious side effects.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info are extracted from sources (local files, process memory, clipboard, network requests) and sent via HTTP POST requests to configured webhook URLs or uploaded to external services. Data flows from the user system outward to remote servers, bypassing user controls.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous indicators of malicious intent: hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive collection of browser and system data, injection of JavaScript into Discord modules, process termination of security and debugging tools, attempts to bypass token protections, and obfuscated or convoluted function logic. It also manipulates files and directories with random names, and performs multiple exfiltration methods. The use of external endpoints for data exfiltration, injection of scripts, and system info collection are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script actively scans the user's environment for sensitive information, including browser passwords, cookies, and tokens, and system identifiers. It injects scripts into Discord to potentially facilitate further malicious activity. It kills processes associated with security tools, disables certain protections, and collects data such as browsing history, system info, and clipboard content. Data is exfiltrated via Discord webhook and external upload services. It also attempts to avoid detection by checking for virtual machine identifiers, process names, and system configurations. The code employs obfuscation and complex flow control, likely to evade static analysis. Overall, the code performs unauthorized access, data theft, process manipulation, and exfiltration, with multiple indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious. It is a comprehensive information-stealer and injection tool that targets browsers, Discord, and system identifiers to steal sensitive data and exfiltrate it covertly. Its behavior aligns with malware designed for data exfiltration and system compromise.",
