{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info-stealer and backdoor, designed to extract passwords, cookies, tokens, system information, and wallet data from the victim's machine. It injects scripts into Discord modules, terminates security processes, performs environment checks to evade detection, and exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and external services like transfer.sh.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), local browser data files (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Edge, Firefox), registry queries, clipboard, process list, system commands, local database files (SQLite), and network info via external API calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and transfer.sh, file uploads, process termination commands, script injection into Discord directories, window hiding via WinAPI, and system info logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local browser and system data sources (passwords, cookies, tokens, history, system info) through decryption routines, then via network requests to exfiltration endpoints. The code also injects scripts into Discord modules, terminates security processes, and manipulates environment to evade detection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, use of Windows API for decryption, process killing commands, injection of malicious scripts into Discord directories, environment checks for VM or sandbox detection, and some obfuscated regex patterns. The code employs multi-threading for concurrent operations and uses encrypted keys for decryption routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive credential theft, token harvesting, browser data extraction, system information gathering, and exfiltration. It injects malicious scripts into Discord modules, terminates security and debugging processes, and employs environment checks to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, decryption routines using Windows APIs, and injection techniques confirm malicious intent. The code's structure indicates moderate obfuscation, with some encrypted keys and complex regex patterns. The multi-threaded approach enhances stealth and efficiency. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors characteristic of advanced malware designed for covert data theft, system sabotage, and persistent control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, performing extensive data exfiltration, process manipulation, injection, and evasion techniques. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; malware score should be 1.0, obfuscation around 0.4, and security risk at 1.0, reflecting the high threat level. The code's behavior aligns with high-confidence malicious activity, warranting immediate containment and removal.",
