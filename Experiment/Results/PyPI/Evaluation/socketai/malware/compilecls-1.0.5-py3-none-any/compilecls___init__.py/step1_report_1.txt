{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including browser passwords, cookies, history, tokens, system info, and files matching specific keywords, then upload or send this data to remote servers or webhooks. It also includes malicious features like process termination, process killing, process injection, and hiding presence, indicating a covert data theft operation.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables for paths, user input, reading local state files, database files (Chrome, Firefox), leveldb files, browser history, cookies, passwords, and user data files from directories like AppData, Roaming, Temp, and user profile directories.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP requests to Discord webhooks and transfer.sh; files are uploaded to external services; system commands and process termination are used to disrupt or hide activities; system info and clipboard data are collected and exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local files and database extractions (passwords, cookies, history, tokens) through decryption functions, then accumulated in memory structures, formatted, and transmitted via network requests to webhooks or upload services. There are process kills and injections that modify system and browser behaviors to facilitate data access.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, base64-encoded encrypted keys, obfuscated or complex regex patterns, multiple processes running in background, use of system calls to kill processes, process injection into Discord, process hiding, system and user information collection, and file manipulations that indicate covert operations. Additionally, the code terminates processes and disables certain security checks, suggesting malicious intent. There is also code that attempts to hide the console window and run in stealth.",
  "analysis": "The code collects a wide range of sensitive data: browser credentials, cookies, history, tokens, system info, and files matching keywords like 'password', 'secret', 'token', and wallet identifiers. It decrypts stored data using Windows CryptUnprotectData and AES keys, then uploads the data to remote URLs via HTTP requests. It terminates or kills system processes like Discord, process hackers, and debuggers. It injects code into Discord desktop files to embed malicious scripts. It also attempts to hide its window, run at startup, and disable certain protections. These behaviors align with data theft, backdoor installation, and system sabotage tactics, consistent with malicious malware targeting user privacy and system security.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious intent, aimed at stealthily exfiltrating user credentials, tokens, cookies, browsing history, and files, while disabling or interfering with system protections and security software. Its extensive use of decryption, process manipulation, and remote data upload strongly indicates malicious malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and system sabotage.",
