{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive information such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and user data, then upload and report this data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (e.g., browser data, cookies, history, passwords), system commands (via subprocess), network responses, and clipboard data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests to webhook URLs and file uploads, reading and writing sensitive data to files, decrypting credentials, and executing system commands such as killing processes and deleting files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (browser files, environment variables, clipboard, system commands) through decryption and parsing functions, then to network transmission (webhooks, file uploads). For example, system info, browser passwords, cookies, tokens, and user data are collected, processed, then exfiltrated via HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes webhook URLs, injects JavaScript into Discord modules, terminates security-related processes, modifies browser extension files, and attempts to detect virtual machine or sandbox environments. It also attempts to kill processes associated with security tools and debug environments. Decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs. It gathers extensive user and system data with malicious intent. Multiple functions lack error handling, and some sections (like process termination and file modification) are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting browsers, Discord tokens, system info, cookies, passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets. It uses decryption functions, interacts with system and browser data, injects scripts into Discord modules, kills processes related to security tools, and uploads all collected data to external webhooks and transfer services. Its use of hardcoded URLs, injection of scripts, process termination, and extensive data exfiltration indicate malicious intent. The code also obfuscates parts, such as encrypted key handling and process checks, and performs environment detection to evade analysis. The overall behavior aligns with typical malware designed for credential theft, surveillance, and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a full-fledged info-stealer targeting browsers, messaging platforms, wallets, and system info. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, injects malicious scripts, and exfiltrates data without user consent. The combination of data theft, process termination, environment checks, and remote injection confirms its harmful purpose.",
