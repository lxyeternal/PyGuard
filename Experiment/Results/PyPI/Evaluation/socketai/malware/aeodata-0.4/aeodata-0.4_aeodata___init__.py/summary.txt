  "conclusion": "The dependency shows high obfuscation and potential for malicious behavior but lacks definitive malicious activity. Scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect the evidence: malware at 0.2–0.3, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk around 0.3. Continuous monitoring is recommended for suspicious code segments."
