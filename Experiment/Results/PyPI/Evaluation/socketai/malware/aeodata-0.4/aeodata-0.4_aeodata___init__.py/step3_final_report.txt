  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution, obfuscated variables, network/socket operations, and data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network transmissions, file operations, and dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input reading or untrusted data leading to sinks like network connections, file writes, or eval/exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score 0.7), dynamic execution constructs, indirect data flows, and network operations without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not conclusively malicious. No concrete malicious activity such as data theft, backdoors, or system damage is identified. The network and file operations appear benign but warrant caution. Scores reflect suspicion levels: malware at 0.2–0.3, obfuscation at 0.7, and moderate security risk around 0.3–0.4. The absence of code in some reports is correctly noted. Overall, the analysis aligns with the evidence, with no false positives or overestimations.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows high obfuscation and potential for malicious behavior but lacks definitive malicious activity. Scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect the evidence: malware at 0.2–0.3, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk around 0.3. Continuous monitoring is recommended for suspicious code segments.",
