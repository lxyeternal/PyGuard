      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup. While the setup appears legitimate, the embedded payload and its obfuscation pose a significant security risk. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Based on observed behavior, the package should be treated with caution due to high potential for malicious activity."
