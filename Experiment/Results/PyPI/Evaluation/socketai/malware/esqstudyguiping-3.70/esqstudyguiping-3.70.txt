      "conclusion": "The code contains high-confidence malicious indicators, primarily the execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command triggered by a filesystem check. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. Immediate review and decoding of the payload are recommended to confirm malicious behavior."
