{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'wessycord' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code downloads a file from a specified URL during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file (payload.exe) is executed directly via os.system, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The URL download (source) flows into saving the file locally, then directly into execution via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external source during installation and executes it without validation, which is highly suspicious. Variable 'file_name' is defined inside a function but used outside its scope, indicating potential errors or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a function 'file' to download a file from a given URL. It then defines a custom install class 'AfterInstall' that, during installation, downloads an executable from an external URL and attempts to run it immediately. The 'file' function's 'file_name' variable is local to the function scope but is used outside, suggesting a potential bug or obfuscation tactic. The setup process uses setuptools to define package metadata, but the critical malicious behavior is in the 'AfterInstall' class, which downloads and executes an external payload without any verification. The URL points to a suspicious location, and executing downloaded content directly is a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during installation, representing a high security threat. This behavior could be used for remote code execution, malware delivery, or system compromise.",
