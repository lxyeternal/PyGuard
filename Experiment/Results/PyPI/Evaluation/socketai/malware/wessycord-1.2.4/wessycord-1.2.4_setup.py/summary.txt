  "conclusion": "The code explicitly downloads and executes a remote payload during installation, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The variable scope issue appears to be a bug or obfuscation tactic but does not negate the malicious intent. Overall, the package is malicious and should be flagged for removal."
