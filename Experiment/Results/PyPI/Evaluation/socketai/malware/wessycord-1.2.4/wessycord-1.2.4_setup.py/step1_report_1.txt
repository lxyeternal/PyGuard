{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'wessycord', with additional actions during installation that involve downloading and executing a file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL string 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' used in the file() function to download an external file.",
  "sinks": "The os.system(file_name) call, which executes the downloaded file on the system.",
  "flows": "The URL is used as a source to download a file; this file is then executed via os.system, constituting a clear source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL during installation and automatically runs it without user consent, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior. The filename variable is used outside its scope, indicating potential oversight or obfuscation. The code's primary purpose appears to be executing remote payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function 'file' to download files from URLs. During the package installation process (via the custom 'AfterInstall' class), it downloads an executable from an external source and runs it automatically. The use of a hardcoded URL pointing to an unknown and suspicious domain, combined with automatic execution of the downloaded file, indicates malicious intent. The code does not validate the downloaded file or check its authenticity. The setup configuration is typical but combined with the malicious behavior, this raises severe security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during installation without user consent. This indicates potential malware delivery or sabotage, with high security risk. The activity is suspicious and should be flagged for removal or further investigation.",
