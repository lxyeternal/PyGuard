{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package called 'wessycord', but it includes malicious behavior to download and execute a payload executable from an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' is used as the source from which a file is downloaded; the 'file' function retrieves this URL and saves it locally.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file (payload.exe) is executed directly via os.system(file_name), which is a high-risk sink because it runs untrusted code on the system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads the payload from the URL (source) and then executes it immediately (sink) during the install process within the 'run' method of the 'AfterInstall' class.",
  "anomalies": "The code hides malicious intent behind a legitimate setup script, downloads an executable from a suspicious external URL, and executes it without user consent. The URL points to a suspicious domain, and the execution of a downloaded payload is highly unusual and malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function 'file' that downloads a file from a provided URL. The 'AfterInstall' class overrides the 'run' method to invoke the download function with a hardcoded malicious URL, then executes the downloaded file immediately. The setup configuration uses setuptools, with the custom 'install' command that runs this malicious behavior during package installation. The code does not perform any validation or checks on the downloaded file, nor does it inform the user, indicating malicious intent to infect or compromise the user's system during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior, downloading and executing an external payload during package installation. It is likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or system compromise. The use of standard setup procedures to conceal malware makes it highly dangerous.",
