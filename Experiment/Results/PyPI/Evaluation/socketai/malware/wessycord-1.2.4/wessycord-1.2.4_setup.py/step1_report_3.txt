{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, downloads and executes an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' used in the file() function called within the AfterInstall.run() method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system(file_name) call executes the downloaded file, potentially running malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "The URL is used as input in the file() function, which downloads the file and then executes it with os.system().",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically downloads and executes an external payload during package installation without user consent, which is highly suspicious. The download URL is from an anonymized file hosting service, which is unusual for legitimate packages. The variable 'file_name' is used outside its scope, indicating a potential bug or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function 'file' that retrieves a file from a specified URL. The 'AfterInstall' class overrides the run method to download and execute a payload from a remote URL during installation. The setup configuration integrates this custom command. The code's behavior of downloading and executing an external payload during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially leading to system compromise. The code lacks validation of the downloaded file, and the URL points to an anonymous file hosting service, raising suspicion about the payload's purpose. The variable 'file_name' is used globally but is only defined locally within the 'file' function, which indicates a bug or obfuscation attempt. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior by automating the download and execution of an external executable, which is a common tactic for deploying malware.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during installation, representing a high security risk. The code aims to silently infect systems upon installation, which is characteristic of malware. The overall security risk score is very high, and it should not be used or distributed.",
