{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package that downloads and executes an external executable file during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe' used in the file() function to download an executable.",
  "sinks": "Execution of os.system(file_name) which runs the downloaded executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves a file from the specified URL and then runs it using os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that executes external code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from an external URL during installation and executing it without any validation or user consent is highly suspicious. The URL is hosted on anonfiles, a platform often used for hosting malicious payloads. The variable 'file_name' is used outside the scope of the 'file()' function, leading to potential errors, but the intent appears malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package but includes a custom install command 'AfterInstall' that, when run, downloads an executable from an external source and executes it. The URL points to a suspicious file (payload.exe), indicating malicious intent. The code does not verify the downloaded file's integrity or origin. The direct execution of external payloads during package installation is a common technique in supply chain attacks. There are no obfuscation techniques, but the malicious behavior is straightforward and concealed within the package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external payload during package installation, posing a significant security risk. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or compromised.",
