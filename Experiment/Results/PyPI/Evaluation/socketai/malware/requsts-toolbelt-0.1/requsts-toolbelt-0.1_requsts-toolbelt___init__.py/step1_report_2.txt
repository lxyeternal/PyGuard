  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module or script performing data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and possibly user inputs or external data files (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands, but no explicit dangerous sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to outputs or external systems, but specific flows cannot be fully determined due to lack of detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure and content indicate standard programming practices. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not manipulate sensitive data or interact with external systems in an insecure manner based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and follows typical coding patterns without suspicious activity.",
