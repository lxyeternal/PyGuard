  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate low scores for malware and security risk. Report 1's concern about dynamic code execution warrants a cautious approach; if confirmed, scores should be increased accordingly. Given the available information, the current scores are appropriate, but verification of eval()/exec() presence is recommended for final risk assessment."
