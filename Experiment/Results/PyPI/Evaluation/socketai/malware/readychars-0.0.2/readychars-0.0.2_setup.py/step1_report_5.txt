  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'readychars' Python module.",
  "sources": "Static values assigned to setup parameters; no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to untrusted sources; no potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, as all data is statically assigned with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "License and URL fields are empty; author and description fields contain email-like strings which are not typical for descriptions, but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It assigns static strings to package metadata, with no input validation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The absence of URL and license information may be incomplete but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward package setup with no malicious intent. It lacks any suspicious code or malicious patterns. Overall risk is negligible.",
