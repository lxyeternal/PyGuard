{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'readychars' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, author info, description, and URL/license fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "Empty URL and license fields, minimal information, but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It contains static, hardcoded metadata fields such as package name, version, author, and description. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution, nor suspicious patterns. The presence of empty URL and license fields is unusual but not malicious. The code does not perform any file operations, network activity, or data processing. Overall, it appears to be a typical package setup file with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious intent. It primarily serves to define package metadata for distribution. No security concerns or malware indications are present.",
