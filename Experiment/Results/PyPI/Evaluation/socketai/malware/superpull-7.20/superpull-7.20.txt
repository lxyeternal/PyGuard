      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high scores assigned by the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as compromised or malicious until further analysis (decoding the payload) confirms safety. The stealth execution, obfuscation, and conditional triggers pose a significant security risk, warranting caution and further investigation."
