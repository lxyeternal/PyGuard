{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'microauth' with basic metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for version, description, author, and email; uses find_packages() to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or handle user input; no network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily sets up package metadata without data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials (beyond metadata), obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines version and description variables, and calls setup() with static parameters. It does not include any code execution, user input handling, or network interactions. All data are static and metadata-related. No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only provides package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious behaviors.",
