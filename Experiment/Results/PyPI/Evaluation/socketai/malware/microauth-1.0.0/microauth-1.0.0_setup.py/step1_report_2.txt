  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'microauth' that provides OAuth functionality.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static package setup data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed or used in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It defines package metadata and dependencies with no dynamic or untrusted input handling. The author information contains non-standard characters, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies list is empty, indicating no external or potentially malicious dependencies are included. The structure and content conform to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a straightforward package configuration.",
