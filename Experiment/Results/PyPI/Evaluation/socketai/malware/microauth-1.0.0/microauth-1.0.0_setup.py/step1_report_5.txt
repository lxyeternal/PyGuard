  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'microauth'.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package metadata, the setup() function with package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The author email contains non-standard characters but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines basic package metadata (name, version, author, description), and calls setup() with standard parameters. There are no external data inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The 'install_requires' list is empty, indicating no dependencies. The email address has non-ASCII characters, which might be unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup script for publishing a Python package without any signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It lacks any suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
