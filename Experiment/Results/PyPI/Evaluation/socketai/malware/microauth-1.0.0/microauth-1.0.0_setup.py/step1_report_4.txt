  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python module named 'microauth'.",
  "sources": "Constants for version, description, author information, and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup() parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow or input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The author email contains non-ASCII characters which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and calls setup() with static information, including author details, version, description, and dependencies. No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The unusual author name encoding could be benign or a typo but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It only contains static metadata for package distribution.",
