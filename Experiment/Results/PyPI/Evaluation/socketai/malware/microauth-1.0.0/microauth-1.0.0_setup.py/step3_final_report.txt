{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'microauth'. It defines static metadata and uses find_packages() to include all packages. There are no dynamic inputs or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, such as name, version, author, email, description, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Static metadata flows directly into the setup() call without external or untrusted data pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual characters in the author name and email (non-ASCII characters) but no malicious intent or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The unusual characters in author details are noted but do not imply malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), with a slight reduction (0.9) due to the non-ASCII characters, but this does not affect the benign conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. All reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
