  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script using setuptools.\n- It defines static package metadata: name, version, author, email, description, etc.\n- It calls `find_packages()` to include all packages.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network calls, or external data sources.\n- The author email contains non-ASCII characters (\"ЕntchenBuilds@gmail.com\"), which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of the Reports**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n- They note the absence of untrusted data, dynamic code, or malicious behavior.\n- They mention the non-ASCII characters in the author email but conclude it's not suspicious.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), except report 4 which is 0.9, still very high.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with benign package setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Logical Consistency & Score Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score (all 0):** Correct. No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated (all 0):** Correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:**\n  - All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - No evidence suggests any security concern or malicious intent.\n- **Author email with non-ASCII characters:** Unusual but not malicious; does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**\n- No issues found in the code or reports.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No need to adjust scores; they reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation**\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n- The non-ASCII characters in the author email are noteworthy but not malicious.\n- The code's simplicity and static nature further confirm its benign intent.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**. The package appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script with no security concerns.",
