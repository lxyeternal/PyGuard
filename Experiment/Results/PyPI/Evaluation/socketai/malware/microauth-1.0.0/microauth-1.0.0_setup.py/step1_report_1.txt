  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'microauth' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading static strings for metadata, calling find_packages() to list package contents.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution points found.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; all inputs are static or controlled by the package maintainer.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. Metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, and description. The use of find_packages() is standard for including package modules. The install_requires list is empty, indicating no dependencies. The author email and name contain non-ASCII characters but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident in the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
