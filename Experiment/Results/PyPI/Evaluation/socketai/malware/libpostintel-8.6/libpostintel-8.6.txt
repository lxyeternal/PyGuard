      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell commands executed conditionally, with suspicious URL embedding and stealthy execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
