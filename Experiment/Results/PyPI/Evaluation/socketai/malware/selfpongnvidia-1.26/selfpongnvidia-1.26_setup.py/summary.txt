  "security_risk": 0.85,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command under conditions that could conceal malicious payloads. The silent execution, obfuscation, and suspicious comments strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores."
