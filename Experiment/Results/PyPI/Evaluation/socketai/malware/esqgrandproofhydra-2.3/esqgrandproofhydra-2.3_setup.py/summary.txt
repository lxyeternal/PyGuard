  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, triggered by the absence of 'tahg'. The obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL comment strongly indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.9, risk 0.85) are justified. The code should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further payload analysis."
