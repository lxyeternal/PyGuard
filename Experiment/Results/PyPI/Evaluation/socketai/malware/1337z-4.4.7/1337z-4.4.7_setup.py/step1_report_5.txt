{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and, during installation, execute a function that communicates with an external server and potentially downloads and executes a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs. It also reads and writes files on the local system and executes a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The 'send' function executes system commands to run a downloaded executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') using 'os.system'. It also sends data to a remote server via requests.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is read and sent to a remote server; then a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed via 'os.system', constituting a flow from environment variable to remote server and local execution of remote payload.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the dynamic download and execution of a remote executable during package installation, which is atypical for standard setup scripts. The URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' is suspicious, and executing downloaded files without validation is risky. The 'send' function runs during post-install, which is not standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package setup but includes a malicious function 'send' called during the post-install phase. This function captures the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and transmits it to an external server. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it, which is a significant security risk. The code's primary malicious activity is the remote communication, data exfiltration, and executing potentially malicious payload during installation. There are no obfuscated elements; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing a remote payload during package installation. This indicates a supply chain attack vector designed to compromise systems installing this package. The overall risk is high, and the package should not be used.",
