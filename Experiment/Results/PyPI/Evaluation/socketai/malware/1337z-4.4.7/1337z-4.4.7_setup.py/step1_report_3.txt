  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes additional code post-installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', remote URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') from a remote server and running it via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request to linkedopports.com -> Download of executable -> Execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Code fetches sensitive environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', sends data to external server, downloads an executable, and runs it without user consent. Use of try-except without handling errors and the remote execution is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to a remote URL, then downloads an executable file from another remote URL, and executes it silently. This behavior is characteristic of potential malicious activity, such as data exfiltration and remote code execution. The execution occurs during the post-install step, which could be used to persist malicious payloads. The code uses requests to fetch external resources and os.system to run potentially harmful code, which indicates malicious intent. The package setup itself appears legitimate, but the post-install behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs malicious actions by exfiltrating system information and executing a remote binary during installation, indicating malicious intent with high confidence. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous for use.",
