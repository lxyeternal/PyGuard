{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom installation process that fetches and executes a remote executable during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URLs for HTTP GET requests; the 'requests' library for network activity.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a local file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe'); executing the downloaded file via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "The 'send' function reads 'COMPUTERNAME', sends it via HTTP GET request, downloads an executable, and executes it; called during package installation in 'PostInstallCommand'.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing an external executable during package installation; reliance on environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' for data collection; silent exception handling obscures failures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to a remote server, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it without user consent or verification. This behavior occurs during the package's installation process via a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. The code leverages standard libraries for setup but incorporates malicious activity hidden within the install process. The URLs and executable names suggest potentially malicious intent, aiming to infect or control the host machine. Exception handling is broad and silent, hiding any errors during these actions. Overall, the code is designed to surreptitiously execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by secretly downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, using environment data for tracking or targeting. It is highly suspicious and could be used to compromise systems.",
