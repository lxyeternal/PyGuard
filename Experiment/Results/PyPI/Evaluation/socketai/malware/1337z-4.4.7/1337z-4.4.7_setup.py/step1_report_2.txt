{
  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process for a Python package, with an additional function to send environment data and potentially download and execute a file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs for GET requests, and the system call to execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) executes a downloaded file, and requests.get sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server via a GET request; if on Windows, the script downloads and executes an executable file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except without handling exceptions; dynamic execution of downloaded content; the 'send' function contacts a suspicious domain and downloads an executable without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote URL. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it, which could be malicious. The function is called during post-installation, making this behavior part of the package's install process. No input validation or user prompts are present. The use of broad exception handling and silent failures reduces transparency but indicates potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The purpose seems to be to exfiltrate system info and run arbitrary code, which aligns with malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data and downloading/executing an external payload during installation. It appears intentionally designed to compromise user systems or perform malicious actions. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
