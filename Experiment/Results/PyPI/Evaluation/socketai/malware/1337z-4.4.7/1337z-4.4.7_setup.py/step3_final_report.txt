{
  "purpose": "The code performs malicious actions during package installation, including data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs for data and payload download, and the installation process triggering the send() function.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to exfiltrate 'COMPUTERNAME', download of executable from suspicious URL, execution of downloaded file via os.system.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sends data via requests.get() -> downloads executable if on Windows -> executes downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling hiding errors, downloading and executing external payloads during setup, use of suspicious domains, unconditional call to send() during install.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally calls send() during setup, which reads environment data and exfiltrates it via an HTTP request. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious domain and executes it silently. The exception handling is broad, hiding errors. External URLs are suspicious, and executing downloaded payloads during installation poses a high security risk. The code's behavior aligns with malicious activity, including remote code execution and data theft. The straightforward nature of the code indicates no obfuscation. All signals point to malicious intent, with high confidence and severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing data exfiltration and executing remote payloads during installation. The behavior is characteristic of malware and supply chain attacks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score of 1, high security risk, and no obfuscation. The package should be flagged as dangerous and removed from distribution.",
