{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes a network request and potentially downloads and runs a file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, downloading an executable file, and executing it via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to 'linkedopports.com' -> download 'python-install.scr' -> execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'send()' during installation, use of external URLs for downloading and executing code, catching all exceptions silently, potentially malicious external domain.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and other modules, then defines a 'send' function that retrieves an environment variable and makes a request to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable 'python-install.scr' from a suspicious domain and executes it. This behavior is embedded into a custom install command 'PostInstallCommand' that calls 'send()' during package installation. The setup configuration registers this custom command. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external scripts during installation, with no user confirmation or security checks. The external domain 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com' are suspicious and could be used for malicious payload delivery.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, including downloading and executing an external script during package installation. It likely aims to infect systems with malware or perform unauthorized actions. The use of external URLs and silent exception handling increases the risk. It should not be used or distributed.",
