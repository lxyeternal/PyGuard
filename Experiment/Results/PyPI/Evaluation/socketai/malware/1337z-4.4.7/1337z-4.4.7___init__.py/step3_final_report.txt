{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'installed' and is immediately invoked.",
  "sources": "The function definition and the call to 'ina()'. No external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: function 'ina()' is defined, then called, resulting in printing a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function that outputs a fixed message. It contains no external data sources, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The analysis across all reports correctly identifies the benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No assumptions are made beyond observable behavior, and the confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
