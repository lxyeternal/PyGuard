  "purpose": "Simple function that prints 'installed' when called.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only static string output.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statement.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static data directly printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; very straightforward code with no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a fixed string. The function is immediately called, resulting in a console output. There are no inputs, no external data sources, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it is likely a placeholder or a minimal example with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs a static message to the console.",
