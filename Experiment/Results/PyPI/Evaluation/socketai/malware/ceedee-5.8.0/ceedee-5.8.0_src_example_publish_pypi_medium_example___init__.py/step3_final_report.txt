  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Any code input, data handling functions, dynamic evaluation functions (eval/exec), environment variable access, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code injection points, network transmission of data, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file operations, possibly via dynamic evaluation or indirect data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, misleading variable names, indirect data handling, minimal or no code provided, lack of comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are generally straightforward with no suspicious functions or obfuscation. Reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, with some noting risky practices like eval/exec but not confirming malicious intent. The malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and obfuscation scores are 0, reflecting clear code. Security risk scores are mostly low (0.2-0.3), with a slight increase (0.4) justified in report 3 due to eval/exec usage. The confidence levels are reasonable, and no false positives are evident. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with their findings, indicating no confirmed malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight concern over eval/exec in report 3 justifies a marginally higher security risk score. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. All evaluations reflect low-risk, benign code snippets with no immediate threats identified.",
