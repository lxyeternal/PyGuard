{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and returns the version of the installed scikit-learn library.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ attribute of the sklearn module.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the version string; no data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sklearn.__version__ source directly to the return output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, which is a well-known machine learning package, and defines a function that returns the library's version. It performs a simple attribute access without any external input, data manipulation, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard library features only.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation—retrieving the sklearn version—with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
