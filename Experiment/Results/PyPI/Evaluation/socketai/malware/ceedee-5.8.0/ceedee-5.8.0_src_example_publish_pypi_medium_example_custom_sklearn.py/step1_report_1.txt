  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version number of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "The import statement `import sklearn` and the attribute access `sklearn.__version__`.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the sklearn version number, which could be used for environment identification but poses minimal security risk.",
  "flows": "Code imports sklearn library -> accesses `sklearn.__version__` -> returns version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs a simple version retrieval without any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sklearn library, a well-known machine learning package, and defines a function to return its version number. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no untrusted data flows. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. It is straightforward and functions solely to report the library version, which is common in dependency checks or environment audits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply retrieves and returns the version of a trusted dependency. No security concerns are evident.",
