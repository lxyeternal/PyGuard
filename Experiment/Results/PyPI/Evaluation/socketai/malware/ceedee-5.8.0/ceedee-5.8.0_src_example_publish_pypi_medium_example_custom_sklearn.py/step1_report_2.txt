  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "The line 'import sklearn' reads the sklearn package; the line 'return sklearn.__version__' accesses the version attribute.",
  "sinks": "Accessing sklearn.__version__ is not a sink that leads to data leaks or security effects; it only reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code imports sklearn and then reads its __version__ attribute to return it; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and only reads package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sklearn package and defines a function that returns the version string of sklearn. The code is simple, with no external input, no data processing, and no side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of sklearn is standard, and reading its version is common practice for compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply retrieves the sklearn package version. No malware or security risks are present.",
