  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the version of the sklearn library.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import sklearn' and access to 'sklearn.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement 'return sklearn.__version__'.",
  "flows": "Import sklearn -> Access sklearn.__version__ -> Return version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly imports sklearn and defines a function to return its version. No external inputs, network activity, or data processing are involved. The code is simple, clear, and relies on a trusted library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The function serves an informational purpose, typical in dependency management or environment checks. All signals indicate benign intent with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It simply retrieves the version of a trusted dependency. The security risk score is 0, malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
