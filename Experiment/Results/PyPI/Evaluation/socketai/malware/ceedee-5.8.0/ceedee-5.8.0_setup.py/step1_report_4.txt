  "purpose": "Collect system information based on OS and send it to a remote API endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reads system commands via os.popen to gather OS details, hostname, user info, directory contents, and password file (on Linux/macOS).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to a remote API endpoint (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response).",
  "flows": "System info is collected through os.popen commands, stored in a data dictionary, URL-encoded, then sent via an HTTP request to the remote endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects sensitive system data, including /etc/passwd on Linux/macOS, and transmits it unencrypted to a remote server. The data collection appears aggressive and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers detailed system information, including hostname, current user, OS details, directory listings, and on Linux/macOS, the password file. It then encodes this data and sends it to an external API endpoint. The data collection involves executing system commands that could reveal sensitive information. There is no validation, obfuscation, or authorization checks on the data transmission. The code does not include any malicious payloads like backdoors, reverse shells, or data exfiltration beyond system info. However, the aggressive collection of sensitive data and its transmission to an external server without user consent or encryption is suspicious and could be used maliciously in a supply chain attack or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions to collect and transmit detailed system information, including sensitive data such as /etc/passwd. It does not perform any overt malicious actions like backdoors or malware, but its behavior is highly invasive and privacy-intrusive. The code could be used maliciously for reconnaissance or data exfiltration if misused, and its data collection practices raise security concerns.",
