{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, including hostname, user, OS details, directory listings, and on Unix-like systems, the contents of /etc/passwd, then transmits this data to an external API endpoint without encryption or user consent.",
  "sources": "os.popen() commands executing hostname, whoami, uname, pwd, ls, and cat /etc/passwd; data collection occurs upon module import.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response with URL-encoded data.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) feed into data dictionary, which is encoded and sent via request.Request to external API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Collection of /etc/passwd content, immediate transmission without encryption or user consent, use of os.popen() for system commands, no safeguards or validation, and data exfiltration occurring automatically.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data, including /etc/passwd, hostname, username, and directory listings, then exfiltrates this data to an external server via an unencrypted HTTP request immediately upon import. Use of os.popen() for executing shell commands can be insecure. The data collection and transmission happen without user awareness or safeguards, indicating malicious or spyware-like behavior. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation, but the behavior is highly privacy-invasive and characteristic of malware designed for data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to its collection of sensitive system data and automatic exfiltration to an external endpoint. It should be flagged as malicious, with a malware score of 0.85, a security risk of 0.9, and obfuscation score of 0.",
