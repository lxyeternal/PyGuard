{
  "purpose": "The code appears to gather OS and system information and send it to an external API endpoint, possibly for telemetry or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "OS command executions via os.popen (hostname, whoami, cat /etc/passwd, uname -a, pwd, ls -la, cd, dir), and data encoding for transmission.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external API endpoint (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) using urllib request, sending collected system data.",
  "flows": "System information obtained through os.popen calls flows into data dictionary, which is then URL-encoded and sent via HTTP POST request to external API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive collection of detailed system information including password file contents on Linux/macOS, hostname, user info, directory listings, and OS details. Data is sent unconditionally to an external API without user consent or control. Commented code also indicates previous similar behavior. No validation, encryption, or user prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The script collects detailed system information through various OS commands depending on the OS detected. It then encodes this data and transmits it to an external API endpoint, potentially without user awareness or consent. The collection includes sensitive data such as hostname, logged-in user, and, on Linux/macOS, the contents of the passwd file. The data transfer occurs immediately upon import, indicating an automatic behavior. The presence of commented-out code suggests prior or alternative implementations of similar data collection. There are no safeguards, encryption, or obfuscation, and the code's purpose appears to be covert data exfiltration, which is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unsanctioned collection and transmission of detailed system information to an external server, indicating malicious intent and potential privacy violation. It qualifies as malicious behavior with high security risk and warrants immediate review and removal.",
