      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicative of malicious activity. The setup function is standard, but the embedded command's obfuscation and silent execution pose a significant security threat. Scores should reflect high malware (close to 0.9), high obfuscation (around 0.9), and high security risk (around 0.85). The package should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms safe intent."
