{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package called 'tptoolcpusplit' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading environment, filesystem (os.path.exists), and potentially executing subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen call executing a PowerShell command with encoded content.",
  "flows": "Checks if 'tahg' exists, then runs a PowerShell encoded command; proceeds to setup package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess without validation; the command content is not human-readable, suggesting obfuscation. The initial check for 'tahg' and the subsequent command may indicate malicious activity or an attempt to conceal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an import of distutils for package setup. It then tries to import subprocess and os modules. If a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, with hidden window settings, which could be malicious or suspicious. The command is encoded, making it difficult to understand its purpose. The setup function defines package metadata for 'tptoolcpusplit' with no validation or sanitization. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, which can hide malicious failures. The encoded PowerShell command warrants suspicion due to obfuscation and execution without validation, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage, especially since it appears to contact a suspicious domain (esquelasquad.rip).",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered under certain conditions, which may be malicious. The setup portion appears standard but is overshadowed by the hidden command execution. Overall, the code likely contains malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism.",
