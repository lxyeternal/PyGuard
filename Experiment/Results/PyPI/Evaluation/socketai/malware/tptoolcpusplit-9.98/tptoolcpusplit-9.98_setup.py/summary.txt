  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup. The scores reflect this risk appropriately. It should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis (e.g., decoding the payload) confirms safety."
