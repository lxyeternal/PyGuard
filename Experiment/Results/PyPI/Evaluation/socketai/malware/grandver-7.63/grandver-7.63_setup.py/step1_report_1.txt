  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'grandver' package, with an embedded PowerShell command that appears to execute a hidden process.",
  "sources": "The 'subprocess.Popen' call with a PowerShell encoded command, the check for 'tahg' directory.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call that executes a PowerShell encoded command, potentially leading to code execution.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script runs the encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which could be malicious; then it proceeds to setup package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a base64-encoded PowerShell command that executes with hidden window style; the encoding suggests obfuscation. The try-except blocks suppress errors without logging. The command appears to be a suspicious encoded payload.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'distutils.core.setup' and then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It checks if a directory 'tahg' exists; if not, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64 via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. This command could be malicious, as encoded PowerShell commands are often used for obfuscated malicious activities. The encoding appears to be designed to hide its purpose. Regardless of the encoding, executing such a command during setup indicates potential malicious intent. The setup function then proceeds to define package metadata, which appears benign. However, the embedded PowerShell command's purpose is suspicious and suggests an attempt to run hidden code or payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, which is highly suspicious and could indicate malicious activity or payload delivery. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious-looking subprocess call.",
