      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of encoded commands, hidden execution, and error suppression are typical in malicious supply chain attacks. Further decoding of the payload is recommended, but current evidence warrants treating this package as malicious."
