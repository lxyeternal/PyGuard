  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code constructs API requests, with parameters flowing into URL, headers, etc.\n- **Sinks:** URL and header setting are potential sinks, but these are standard for SDKs.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes it's a standard SDK without malicious intent, which aligns with the code. The confidence is high (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on request construction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request signing and URL generation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; the signing process is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states it's a standard SDK, with no malicious features, matching the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard, with signing and request setup.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Concludes the code is legitimate SDK code with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request signing and URL creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, standard SDK request construction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request signing, URL, headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Concludes it's a legitimate SDK component.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.2), reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code is a standard SDK implementation for Alibaba Cloud API requests.**  \n- **No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code detected.**  \n- **All reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.**\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (since the code involves signing and request construction, which could be misused if integrated maliciously, but on its own, it's standard SDK code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
