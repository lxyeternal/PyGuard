  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the SDK's role in request construction and signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows from user input into URL/signature generation.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is a standard SDK, with no malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; involves request signing and header setting.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes standard SDK design, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; request signing and URL construction.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is a standard SDK without malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; aligns with code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; request signing, headers, URL.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as a legitimate SDK.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes standard SDK behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard SDK for Alibaba Cloud API requests.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All zero, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.2), reflecting general caution but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- It uses standard cryptographic signing functions, external signing modules, and request construction methods.\n- No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- The data flows are typical for SDK implementations, with no malicious intent.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, structured code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Minimal, based on general SDK exposure, but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
