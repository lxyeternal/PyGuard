  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, logical consistency, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard SDK for Alibaba Cloud, sourcing data from method parameters, class attributes, and headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes that URL generation and header setting are potential sinks, with data flowing from user input into request construction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the request construction process, including signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies URL signing and header setting as potential sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; the process is standard SDK behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes the SDK's request and signing logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that signing functions and headers are potential sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states that the code is for constructing and signing requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that URL signing and headers are potential sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; standard SDK logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes request construction and signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identifies URL and header functions as potential sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well reasoned, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, standard SDK code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2), justified by the fact that request signing involves user-controlled parameters and secrets, which could be misused if mishandled outside this code. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard SDK risk level, considering potential misuse of parameters)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical SDK implementation with no evident security flaws or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2          |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
