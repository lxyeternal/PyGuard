{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for validating integer parameters and string patterns, likely used for input validation within a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer' and 'prop' for validation functions.",
  "locks": "Raise ClientException if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Input data (integer and string) is validated through conditional checks, potentially leading to exceptions being raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. Use of regex matching and type checks is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation by asserting that integers are positive and that strings match specific regex patterns. It raises exceptions for invalid inputs, which is typical for validation routines. No external data sources, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to expected practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard input validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs checks and raises exceptions on invalid input as intended, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
