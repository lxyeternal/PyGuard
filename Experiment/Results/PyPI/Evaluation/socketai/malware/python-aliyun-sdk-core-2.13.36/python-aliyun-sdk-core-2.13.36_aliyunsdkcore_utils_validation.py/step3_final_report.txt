  "purpose": "Validation functions for ensuring positive integers and pattern matching in SDK parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer' and 'prop' used in validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising with error messages containing parameter names and patterns.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; exceptions are raised if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard validation logic with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two straightforward validation functions: one checks if an integer is positive, the other verifies if a string matches a regex pattern. Both functions raise exceptions with specific error codes upon validation failure. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data transmission. The exception messages could potentially leak internal validation details if logs are exposed, but this is a common practice in validation routines. The code is simple, readable, and uses standard modules and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
