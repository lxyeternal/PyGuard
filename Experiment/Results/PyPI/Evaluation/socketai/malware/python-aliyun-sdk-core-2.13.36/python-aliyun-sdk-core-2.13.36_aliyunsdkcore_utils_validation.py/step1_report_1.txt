  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating parameters, specifically checking if an integer is positive and if a string matches a pattern.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer', 'prop', and 'pattern' passed to functions 'assert_integer_positive' and 'validate_pattern'.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with detailed error messages, potentially revealing internal validation logic.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, and exceptions are raised if validation fails, but no data is transmitted externally or malicious code is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no external communications or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple validation utilities: one checks if an integer is positive, the other validates a string against a regex pattern. The functions raise exceptions with error codes and messages if validations fail. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of exceptions for validation errors is standard, and no unsafe or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward validation functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical validation code used in SDK or API parameter checks.",
