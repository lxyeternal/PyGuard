  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Two functions:\n  - `assert_integer_positive(integer, name)`: Checks if `integer` is an `int` and > 0; raises `ClientException` with a specific error code if not.\n  - `validate_pattern(prop, prop_name, pattern)`: Uses `re.search()` to match `prop` against `pattern`; raises `ClientException` if no match.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward validation logic, common in SDKs and APIs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- Exception messages are standard and intended for validation errors.\n- Use of regex and exception handling is standard and safe.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain tampering.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low (around 0.1), which is reasonable given the context.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Confidence levels are high, indicating consensus.\n\n**Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- The reports mention the possibility of exception messages revealing internal validation logic, but this is typical and not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests that these functions are used maliciously elsewhere; they are utility functions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard validation utility.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the utility nature but minimal risk)  \n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is benign and performs expected validation tasks without any malicious intent.",
