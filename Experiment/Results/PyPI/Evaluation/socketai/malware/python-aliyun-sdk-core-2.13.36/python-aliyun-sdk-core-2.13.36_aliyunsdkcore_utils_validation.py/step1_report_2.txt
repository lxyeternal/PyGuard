  "purpose": "Validation of input parameters, specifically ensuring integers are positive and strings match a pattern, within a client SDK context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer', 'prop', 'pattern', and 'prop_name' received by functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising with error messages, which could potentially reveal sensitive info if improperly handled in logs or UI.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; if invalid, exceptions are raised with messages containing parameter details. No data is transmitted or stored beyond validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Code strictly performs validation. Usage of regular expressions and exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two validation functions: 'assert_integer_positive' checks that an integer is positive, raising an exception if not. 'validate_pattern' verifies a string against a regex pattern, raising an exception if it doesn't match. Both functions use standard Python modules and exception classes. No external data flow, no network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward validation utility within an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard input validation module for an SDK, with no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. It performs expected parameter checks and raises exceptions for invalid input. No indicators of sabotage or malicious intent are present.",
