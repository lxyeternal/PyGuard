  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code provides two utility functions:\n     - `assert_integer_positive(integer, name)` checks if the input `integer` is an integer greater than zero.\n     - `validate_pattern(prop, prop_name, pattern)` checks if the string `prop` matches the regex `pattern`.\n   - Both functions raise a `ClientException` with specific error codes if validation fails.\n   - The code is straightforward, using standard Python modules (`re`) and exception handling.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.\n   - No external data transmission, network activity, or malicious payloads are observed.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard validation logic with no malicious intent.\n   - They highlight the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating agreement among reviewers.\n   - The security risk scores are low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal concern beyond validation errors.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the benign functionality, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified, primarily reflecting that validation failures could disrupt normal operation but do not pose security threats.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code performs validation only.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the analysis is based solely on the provided code.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads are present.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard validation utility with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.\n   - There is no need to adjust the scores; they accurately reflect the security posture.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to validation failure handling, not security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is benign and typical for SDK parameter validation.",
