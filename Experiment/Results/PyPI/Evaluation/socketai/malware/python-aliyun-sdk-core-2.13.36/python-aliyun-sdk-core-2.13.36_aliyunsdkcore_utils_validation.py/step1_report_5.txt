  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating integer parameters and regex pattern matching, likely used in API request validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions `assert_integer_positive` and `validate_pattern`.",
  "sinks": "Raising `ClientException` with specific error codes and messages when validation fails.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; if invalid, exceptions are raised, terminating flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Functions perform straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validation functions: one checks if an integer is positive, another checks if a string matches a regex pattern. Both raise exceptions on failure, which is typical for input validation. No external data fetching, no malicious logic, no suspicious code patterns. Importantly, the code relies on standard Python regex and exception handling without obscure language features. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to be a standard validation utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic validation tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard part of input validation logic used in many applications. No evidence of malware, supply chain attacks, or malicious behavior found.",
