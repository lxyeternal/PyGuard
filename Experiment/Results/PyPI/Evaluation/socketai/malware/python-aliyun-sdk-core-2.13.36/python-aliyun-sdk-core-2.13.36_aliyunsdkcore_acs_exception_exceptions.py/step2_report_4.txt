  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines two custom exception classes: `ClientException` and `ServerException`.\n- Both classes inherit from Python's `Exception`.\n- They store error codes, messages, and optional HTTP status and request IDs.\n- Error types are imported from an external module `aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception`.\n- The classes include setters and getters, and `__str__` methods for formatted output.\n- No network activity, code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n- External input (error code, message, etc.) is stored as attributes, which is typical.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n- The use of setters and getters is conventional; no issues here.\n\n### Scores given in reports:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2.\n- Given the code's purpose and implementation, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The code does not process untrusted data beyond storing it, and no network or code execution is involved.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The only potential concern is if error data (codes/messages) are externally controlled and then displayed or logged insecurely. But this is standard for error handling and not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mainly due to potential misuse of error data if misused externally, but this is standard in exception handling)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured exception module for an SDK. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, given the potential for error data to be misused if logs are not secured, but this is a common risk in error handling)\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
