{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling client and server errors within an SDK, encapsulating error codes, messages, and optional HTTP status and request IDs.",
  "sources": "Error code, message, HTTP status, and request ID parameters provided during exception instantiation; external error_type module providing error type constants.",
  "sinks": "Error information stored in exception attributes; formatted output via __str__ method; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (error code, message, etc.) flow into exception objects; error details accessed via getters or printed; no external data flow beyond exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; standard exception class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, storing error details and providing formatted string representations. It imports error_type from an external module, which could be a point of concern if compromised, but within this context, it is standard. The classes include setters and getters, typical for such structures. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is straightforward error handling, with no signs of sabotage or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK exception module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores accurately reflect its benign and straightforward design. No further action is necessary.",
