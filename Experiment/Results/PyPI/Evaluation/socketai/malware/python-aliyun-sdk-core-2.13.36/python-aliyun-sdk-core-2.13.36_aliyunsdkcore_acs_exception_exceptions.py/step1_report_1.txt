  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors in the aliyunsdkcore library.",
  "sources": "Error type imported from aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception; exception initialization parameters (code, msg, http_status, request_id).",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and error codes that could potentially be used for injection or misleading error reporting if manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "External input (error code, message, http_status, request_id) flows into exception instances, influencing their string representation and error information outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. Use of exception classes and attribute setters is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes ClientException and ServerException, which store error details and provide methods for setting and retrieving error information. The code imports an error_type from an external module and uses it to assign error types. Exception classes are standard in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior. Error message and code attributes could be misused if error data is externally controlled, but this is typical in exception handling. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The design appears straightforward for error handling in an SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard exception class definitions for an SDK, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles error information with standard patterns. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
