{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors in an SDK, specifically related to Alibaba Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Error messages, error codes, HTTP status, and request IDs passed to exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ methods format error information for output; error codes, messages, and request IDs could be logged or displayed.",
  "flows": "Input data (error code, message, HTTP status, request ID) flows into exception objects via constructors, then potentially flows into output via __str__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard exception handling and data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, with typical constructor and getter/setter methods. It imports error_type from an external module. The __str__ methods format error details for output. No code execution, external data retrieval, or dynamic code evaluation occurs. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected. The purpose is to encapsulate error details for SDK error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, and the code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard custom exception classes for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It solely manages error information and formatting, with no suspicious or harmful behaviors detected.",
