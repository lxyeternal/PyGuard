  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code simply defines classes for error handling, storing error details, and formatting output. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n   - They correctly note that error details could be misused if externally controlled, but this is typical for exception handling.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: very low (mostly 0 or 0.2)\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the findings.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues or behaviors in the code justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - **Confirmed:** No justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n   - **Confirmed:** The malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - The analysis is cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign SDK exception module.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just standard error handling, minimal security concern)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for SDK error handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, external threats, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The minor security risk score reflects the potential misuse of error information if errors are externally controlled, but this is standard and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The code is safe and does not pose security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate; I agree with the assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No further action needed. The code is safe, and the risk is minimal.",
