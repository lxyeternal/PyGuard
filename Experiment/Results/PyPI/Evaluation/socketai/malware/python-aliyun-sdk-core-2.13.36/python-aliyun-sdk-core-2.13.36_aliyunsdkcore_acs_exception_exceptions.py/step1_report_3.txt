{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors in an SDK, specifically for Alibaba Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports error_type from aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or output based on untrusted input within this code",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process external or untrusted data streams",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard implementation of custom exception classes with no hidden or unusual code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, inheriting from Python's Exception. It initializes error codes, messages, error types, and optional HTTP status and request IDs for server exceptions. The methods are straightforward setters and getters. There is no processing of untrusted data, no network activity, no code injection, no obfuscation, and no malicious code present. The import statement is benign and expected for such exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a clear purpose of defining custom exceptions with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It functions as intended for error handling in an SDK environment.",
