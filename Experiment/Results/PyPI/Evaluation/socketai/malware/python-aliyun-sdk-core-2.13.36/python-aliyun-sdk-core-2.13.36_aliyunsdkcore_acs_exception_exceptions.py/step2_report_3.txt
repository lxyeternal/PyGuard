  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines two custom exception classes: `ClientException` and `ServerException`.\n- Both classes inherit from Python's `Exception`.\n- They store error codes, messages, and optionally HTTP status and request IDs.\n- They import `error_type` from an external module, which provides constants for error types.\n- The code uses standard patterns for exception handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- The attributes can be set externally, which could be misused if error data is externally controlled, but this is typical in error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard exception classes; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Comments:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems somewhat high given the straightforward nature of the code. The code does not perform any risky operations; the risk might be overestimated. I suggest lowering it to 0.1 or 0, unless there's context outside this code indicating potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No external data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comments:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, data leaks, or code injection.\n- **Analysis:** Standard exception classes; benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard exception classes; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comments:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No processing of untrusted data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK exception classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- The overall assessment across all reports is consistent: the code is standard, safe, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The only point of contention is the `securityRisk` score in Report 1, which is set at 0.2. Given the code's simplicity and lack of risky operations, this should be lowered to 0 or 0.1 for accuracy.\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation scores are correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign SDK exception handling module. The reports are generally accurate, with minor overestimation of security risk in Report 1.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and well-structured.",
