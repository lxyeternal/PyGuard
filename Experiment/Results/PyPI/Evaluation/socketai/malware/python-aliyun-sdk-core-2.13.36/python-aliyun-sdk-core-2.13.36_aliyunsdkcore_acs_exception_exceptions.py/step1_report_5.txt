{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling client and server errors within an SDK, specifically related to Alibaba Cloud SDK core errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'error_type' from an external module 'aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception', which provides error type constants.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or generate outputs that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code primarily sets and retrieves error codes and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's Exception, with methods for setting and getting error details. It imports an external error_type module, but does not process external data or execute untrusted code. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure is typical for SDK error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard SDK exception handling module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines exception classes for error reporting.",
