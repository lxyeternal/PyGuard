  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for client and server errors in the aliyunsdkcore library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the exception constructors (code, msg, http_status, request_id).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent to external systems, files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored as attributes; no external data flow or processing beyond assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes with standard initialization and string representation methods. It imports error_type from an external module and uses it to assign error types. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution features are present. The parameters are stored internally without any manipulation or external effects. The overall structure appears standard for custom exception handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides structured exception classes for use within a larger SDK, with no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. It appears to be straightforward and safe.",
