  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code defines standard custom exception classes, imports an error_type, and uses typical patterns for error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that there's no malicious intent or security risk is accurate. The error_type import could, in theory, be manipulated if the external module is compromised, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious code) — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — slightly elevated due to external dependency, but generally acceptable.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward exception class definitions, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard implementation, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — correct.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as previous, standard exception classes, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security issues.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — correct.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard exception classes, external import of error_type is benign in context.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. The slightly elevated risk in some reports (0.2) due to external dependencies is acceptable, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.  \n- **Risk:** 0 to 0.2, depending on the interpretation of external dependencies.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- The code is standard SDK exception handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The minimal risk score (around 0.1) reflects the external dependency but does not indicate actual security concern.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above, confirming that the code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
