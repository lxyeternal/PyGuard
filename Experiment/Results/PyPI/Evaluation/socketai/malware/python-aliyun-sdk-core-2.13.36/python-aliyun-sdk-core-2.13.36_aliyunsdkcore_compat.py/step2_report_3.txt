  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily utility functions for cross-version Python compatibility.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The functions perform standard type conversions and base64 operations.\n- No external data flows, network interactions, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is straightforward and common in multi-Python environment support.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n   \n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0 or 0.0, indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The code is clear and straightforward, with no signs of hiding intent.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - The code performs harmless utility functions without external data or insecure operations.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No issues are found in the code or the reports' reasoning.\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is utility in nature, its inclusion in a supply chain does not inherently introduce security risks.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign, utility nature. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's purpose.",
