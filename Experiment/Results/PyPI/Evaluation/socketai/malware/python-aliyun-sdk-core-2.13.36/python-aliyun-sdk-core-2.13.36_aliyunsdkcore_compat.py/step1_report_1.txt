  "purpose": "Define compatibility functions for base64 encoding/decoding and byte/string conversions across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Importing 'six' for version detection, standard library modules 'base64', type checks for strings and bytes",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in the code",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is primarily utility functions for data type conversions without data flow involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is standard compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version via 'six.PY2'. It imports appropriate base64 functions for encoding and decoding based on Python version. It defines 'ensure_bytes' and 'ensure_string' functions for converting data types between strings and bytes, tailored for Python 2 and 3. All operations are standard, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. There are no suspicious data flows or dangerous code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides utility functions for data type conversions and base64 operations, which are common in cross-version Python projects. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
