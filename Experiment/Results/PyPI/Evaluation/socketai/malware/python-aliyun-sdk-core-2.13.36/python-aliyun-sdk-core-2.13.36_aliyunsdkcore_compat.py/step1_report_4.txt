  "purpose": "Utility functions for ensuring data is in bytes or string format, compatible with Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports from aliyunsdkcore.vendored.six; no external or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output functions are used in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs type conversions without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, with usage of legacy unicode types and conditional imports. No suspicious code behaviors or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are straightforward type check and conversion utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to convert data to bytes or strings, handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3. It uses standard library functions for base64 encoding/decoding, with proper conditional imports. No untrusted data sources, no external network communication, and no manipulation of sensitive data are observed. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe utility functions for data type handling across Python versions. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are evident.",
