  "purpose": "This script is a setup module for the 'aliyunsdkcore' Python SDK package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from the module, reads README.rst file for long description, imports dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "Uses the imported variables and file contents to pass to setuptools.setup, which does not involve untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description data from files and module, then passes these to setup(), with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard setup patterns and license notices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python package setup operations: importing modules, reading version info, reading README, defining dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup(). There are no suspicious code injections, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The presence of license comments and clear structure indicates legitimate package setup functionality. No untrusted data processing, code injection, or malicious network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
