{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the 'aliyunsdkcore' Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via dynamic import (__import__(PACKAGE).__version__), reads README.rst for long description, and defines dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "Calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and data, which influences package installation and distribution.",
  "flows": "Version info is imported from the package; README content is read and passed to setup(); dependencies and package data are specified and used during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The dynamic import assumes the package exists, which is standard but could cause errors if missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, performing standard operations without network activity or malicious logic. The dynamic version import is common practice. No anomalies or security issues are present. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
