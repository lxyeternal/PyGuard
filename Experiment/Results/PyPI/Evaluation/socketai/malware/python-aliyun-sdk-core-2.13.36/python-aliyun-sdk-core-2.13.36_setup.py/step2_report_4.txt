  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same script, a standard Python `setup.py` for packaging a module.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code performs typical tasks: importing modules, reading a README, dynamically importing version info, and calling `setup()`.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The dynamic import of version info from the package is standard practice, assuming the package exists and is correctly installed during setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws:** None identified. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk score** should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n- The **malware score** should stay at 0.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The code is a typical setup script without any suspicious or malicious logic.\n- The dynamic import of version info is standard, provided the package exists.\n- No external data, secrets, or code injection points are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all the reports and the code review, I agree with the current scores:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious behavior or code detected.                                                        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear and standard; no obfuscation present.                                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.                                      |\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No supply chain or security issues are apparent.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend maintaining the current scores and monitoring for any future updates or modifications that could introduce risks.",
