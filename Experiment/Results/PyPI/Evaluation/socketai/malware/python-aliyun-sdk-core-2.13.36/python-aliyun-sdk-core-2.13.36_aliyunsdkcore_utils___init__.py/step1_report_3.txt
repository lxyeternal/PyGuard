  "purpose": "Load a JSON file from the 'data' directory relative to the 'aliyunsdkcore' package.",
  "sources": "Reading the JSON file specified by 'basename' from the filesystem using open()",
  "sinks": "json.loads() processes the file contents; reading a file from the filesystem",
  "flows": "The function takes 'basename', constructs a path, reads file content, and loads JSON data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to load JSON data from a file located in the 'data' directory relative to the package's location. It uses standard library functions for path resolution and file reading. No user input beyond 'basename' influences the file path directly, and the function operates within a fixed directory structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Usage of 'json.loads()' on a file read is standard and safe in this context. The code appears to be a legitimate utility function for configuration or data loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility function for loading JSON data from the package's data directory. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
