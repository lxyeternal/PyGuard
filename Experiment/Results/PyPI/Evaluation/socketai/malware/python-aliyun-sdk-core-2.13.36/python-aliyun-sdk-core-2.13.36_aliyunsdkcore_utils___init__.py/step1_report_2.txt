  "purpose": "Load JSON data from a file located within the package directory",
  "sources": "Reading from a JSON file specified by 'basename' in the 'data' subdirectory of the package",
  "sinks": "json.loads() processing of file contents; reading file content without validation",
  "flows": "File read (os.path.join -> open) -> json.loads()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. Usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function constructs a path to a JSON file inside the package's 'data' directory based on the provided basename. It then opens and reads the file content, parsing it as JSON. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code is standard for loading local data files and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for loading JSON data from a local file within a package. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
