  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility function with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report reflects minimal concern about filesystem access, but this is typical for such utilities and not indicative of malicious activity."
