{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python dependency that appears benign, performing data processing or utility functions without suspicious constructs or malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, files, or parameters; no hardcoded secrets or external inputs indicating malicious intent.",
  "sinks": "Outputs such as file writes, network requests, or print statements; no evidence of untrusted data leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), with no suspicious or malicious data paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or insecure practices are evident. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9). No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The security risk is low (0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the code clarity. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal concerns, primarily due to the lack of suspicious patterns. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
