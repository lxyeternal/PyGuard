      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command based on filesystem state. The use of encoding, hidden execution, and error suppression aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks or backdoors. Scores of malware (~0.75-0.8), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.8-0.85) are justified. The package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further decoding of the payload."
