      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed stealthily conditioned on filesystem state, indicating malicious behavior. The use of error suppression and hidden execution flags further supports this. The package should be treated as potentially malicious and further analyzed, especially decoding the PowerShell payload for full assessment."
