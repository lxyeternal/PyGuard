  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies ('requests' and 'discord_webhook'), and uses 'find_packages()' for package discovery.\n- No runtime code execution, user input, external data sources, or network activity occurs here.\n- The dependencies are common and benign.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. This aligns with the original code, which is a straightforward setup script.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` — correct, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign `0` — justified, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Are the dependency choices suspicious?**  \n  No. 'requests' and 'discord_webhook' are common libraries.\n- **Are there any assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities based on dependencies alone.\n- **Is the reasoning consistent?**  \n  Yes, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard setup script with no security issues. No changes to scores are necessary.",
