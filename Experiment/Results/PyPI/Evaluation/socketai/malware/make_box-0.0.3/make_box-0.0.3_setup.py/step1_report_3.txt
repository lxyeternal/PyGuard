  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'make_box', defining its metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and imported modules. No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the setup script purely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. The 'install_requires' includes common libraries like 'requests' and 'discord_webhook', which are legitimate dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It assigns a version string, lists packages found via 'find_packages()', and specifies required dependencies and classifiers. All elements are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation. The dependencies are common for projects involving HTTP requests and Discord integrations, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It does not contain any malware, security risks, or anomalies.",
