  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The dependencies ('requests' and 'discord_webhook') are common libraries used for HTTP requests and Discord integrations.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data sinks are present.\n- The version is hardcoded as '0.0.3' and the code is static.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and matches the description; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. No logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign analysis.\n   - The dependencies are common and not malicious by themselves.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the static analysis.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Final reasoning:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The dependencies are standard and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No runtime or dynamic behaviors that could introduce security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the package as benign.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
