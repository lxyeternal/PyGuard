  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'make_box'.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; standard setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; only package metadata and dependencies are specified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency list is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of 'requests' and 'discord_webhook' dependencies may be for communication or notifications but are common in legitimate applications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The dependencies 'requests' and 'discord_webhook' could potentially be used for network communication, but their inclusion alone is common and not indicative of malicious intent. The version and other metadata are standard. No code execution, data handling, or input processing is present that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
