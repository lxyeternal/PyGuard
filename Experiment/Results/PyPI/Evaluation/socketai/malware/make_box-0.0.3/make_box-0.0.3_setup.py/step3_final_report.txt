  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, with no runtime behaviors, data processing, or network activity. Dependencies are common libraries. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static and benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
