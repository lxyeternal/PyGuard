      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, indicating potential malicious intent or sabotage. The broad exception handling masks errors, and the encoded command should be decoded and analyzed further. Given the evidence, the package poses a significant security threat and should be treated as malicious until verified otherwise."
