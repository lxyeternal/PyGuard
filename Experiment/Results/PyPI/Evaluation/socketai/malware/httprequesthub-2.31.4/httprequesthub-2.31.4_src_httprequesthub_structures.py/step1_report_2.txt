{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures; data passed to constructors, and attribute access within methods.",
  "sinks": "None present; data structures do not involve external data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows through dictionary operations such as __setitem__, __getitem__, and update, but all within controlled memory structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard library features, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures (case-insensitive dict and a simple lookup dict). The CaseInsensitiveDict maintains case-insensitive keys with case-sensitive iteration. The LookupDict allows attribute-like access to an internal dictionary. Both classes do not perform any network activity, file I/O, or external interactions. No suspicious logic or malicious code patterns are present. The code relies on standard library features and does not include any obfuscated or complex dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for data structure implementations with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be safe and standard in functionality.",
