  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities for managing cookies in requests, including creating, extracting, and manipulating cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reading request data via MockRequest; accessing response headers in extract_cookies_to_jar; manipulating cookies via methods like set, get, remove_cookie_by_name.",
  "sinks": "Cookie data manipulation functions such as set_cookie, remove_cookie_by_name, and merging functions which modify cookies in jars; get_cookie_header which outputs cookie headers.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into jars; cookies are added or removed based on function calls; cookie headers are generated for requests; cookies are created from dicts and morsels; cookies are merged into jars.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mock classes to interface with request/response, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity or reverse shells present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes and functions for managing HTTP cookies within the requests library ecosystem, including cookie extraction, creation, removal, and merging. All classes and functions adhere to expected behaviors for cookie management without executing or handling untrusted code or data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The implementation appears standard and intended solely for cookie handling. The use of mock classes for request and response wrapping is typical for library compatibility and does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present. The overall code is a standard utility module with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for cookie management in the requests library. It provides mechanisms to handle cookies securely and predictably without any signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The design and implementation follow standard patterns and do not exhibit obfuscation or harmful activities.",
