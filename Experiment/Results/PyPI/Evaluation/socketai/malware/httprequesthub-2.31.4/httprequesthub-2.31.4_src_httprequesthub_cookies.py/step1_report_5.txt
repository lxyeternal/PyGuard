{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for handling cookies in the requests library, including compatibility with http.cookiejar.CookieJar.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as calendar, copy, time, threading, and internal utils; accesses request and response objects; reads headers and cookies from request/response objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie handling methods such as add_cookie_header, extract_cookies, set_cookie, and internal cookie manipulation functions; potential for cookies to be set or modified.",
  "flows": "Request object is wrapped into MockRequest; headers and cookies are extracted and added to cookie jars; cookies are created, updated, or removed via functions like create_cookie, cookiejar_from_dict, merge_cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. The code appears to focus solely on cookie management, with standard utility functions and class implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities compatible with requests and http.cookiejar. It wraps request/response objects for cookie extraction and header management, supports cookie creation, deletion, and merging, and ensures pickleability of cookie jars. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code functions as intended for cookie handling without containing malicious payloads or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for cookie management in requests, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs standard operations related to cookies and their handling, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
