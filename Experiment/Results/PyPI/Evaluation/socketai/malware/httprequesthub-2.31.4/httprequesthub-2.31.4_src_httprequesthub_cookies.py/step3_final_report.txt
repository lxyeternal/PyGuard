{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for cookie management, including extraction, header creation, cookie jar manipulation, and cookie creation from various inputs. Designed to interface with request and response objects for handling cookies in HTTP transactions.",
  "sources": "Request objects (via MockRequest), response headers (via response._original_response.msg), cookie data (via Morsel objects and dictionaries).",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers in requests, cookie jar modifications, cookie extraction from responses, header generation functions.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into MockRequest, which supplies cookie headers; response headers are used to extract cookies into the jar; cookie creation functions generate cookie objects that are stored in the jar; cookie headers are generated from the jar for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured utilities for handling cookies within the requests library. It uses mock classes to interface with request and response objects, manages cookies via a custom CookieJar subclass, and offers functions for creating, extracting, and merging cookies. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic follows typical patterns for cookie management, with no signs of malicious intent or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie handling in HTTP transactions. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a very low risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
