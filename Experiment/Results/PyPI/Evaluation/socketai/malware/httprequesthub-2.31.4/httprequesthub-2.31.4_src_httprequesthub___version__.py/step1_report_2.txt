  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "None present; no external data sources or untrusted input handling identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static variable assignments and comments. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides package metadata with no indications of external data input, network activity, or executable logic. There are only variable assignments of strings and constants, including Unicode characters for decoration. No code execution, external data access, or potential attack vectors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves only as package information, and there are no security concerns based on this fragment.",
