  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to define metadata variables for a Python package or module, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded as string literals assigned to variables at the top of the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points in this code snippet; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; this is simply metadata variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only static variable assignments with no unusual or suspicious constructs. The comment art at the top is benign and decorative.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of metadata declarations, which are typical for Python package modules. No code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs. The decorative comments do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.",
