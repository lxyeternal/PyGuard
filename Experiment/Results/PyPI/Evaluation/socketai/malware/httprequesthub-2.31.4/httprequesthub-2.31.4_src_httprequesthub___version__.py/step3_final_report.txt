{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata such as title, description, version, author, and license for the Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "Decorative comments with ASCII art and Unicode characters; no malicious or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable declarations for package metadata, with no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or executable logic. Comments are purely decorative. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata declaration with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
