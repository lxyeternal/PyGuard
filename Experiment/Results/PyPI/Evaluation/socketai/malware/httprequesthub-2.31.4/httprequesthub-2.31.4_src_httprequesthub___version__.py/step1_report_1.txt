{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata attributes for a Python package or module, providing information such as title, description, version, author, and license.",
  "sources": "The source of data is static metadata assignments within the code itself, without external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs, as the code only assigns static string and numeric values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code contains only metadata assignments, no dynamic code execution, no hidden instructions, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of variable assignments for package metadata. It includes aesthetic comments and Unicode characters but no logic or data processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The metadata appears typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining package metadata with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hidden functionality.",
