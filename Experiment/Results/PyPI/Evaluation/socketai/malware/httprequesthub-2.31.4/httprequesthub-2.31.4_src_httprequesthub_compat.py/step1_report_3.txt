  "purpose": "Compatibility and import resolution for Python 2 and 3 in the requests.compat module.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, external package imports (chardet, simplejson), and internal module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; no unsafe operations observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code is straightforward and typical for a compatibility module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various standard and third-party libraries conditionally, sets up compatibility variables for Python version, and defines some aliases. There are no functions, no data processing, and no network operations. All code appears to serve as compatibility shims without executing any untrusted or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2 and 3 with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages imports and compatibility variables, which is safe.",
