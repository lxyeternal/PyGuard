{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for different Python versions and manage module imports, ensuring backward compatibility for HTTP and JSON handling.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib), variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data is processed or output directly to system or network.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily manages imports and compatibility layers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard compatibility and import practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, version checks, and compatibility layers. It includes fallbacks for optional dependencies (chardet, simplejson), and defines compatibility variables and imports. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard for a compatibility module, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2/3 and HTTP/JSON handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It serves its intended purpose without any signs of sabotage.",
