  "purpose": "Compatibility support for Python 2 and 3, handling import fallbacks and version detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info checks, conditional imports, variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process data flows; it sets up environment variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim managing imports and version detection for Python 2 and 3. It conditionally imports modules like chardet, simplejson, and fallback json, and defines version flags and type aliases. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code uses well-known patterns for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. The purpose is solely to facilitate compatibility, and all patterns are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, well-understood patterns with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
