{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues for the requests library, particularly for Python 2 and Python 3, and manages module imports with fallbacks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, and urllib.request.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code primarily performs imports and assigns type aliases. No data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets compatibility flags, with no data processing or untrusted input handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard compatibility import logic, no obfuscated or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded credentials or secret data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim for Python versions and manages optional dependencies gracefully. It only imports modules, assigns some variables for version detection, and handles fallback imports. There are no functions executing untrusted code, no network calls, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. It aligns with standard patterns used for maintaining backwards compatibility in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer for Python 2/3, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely performs safe imports and simple variable assignments.",
