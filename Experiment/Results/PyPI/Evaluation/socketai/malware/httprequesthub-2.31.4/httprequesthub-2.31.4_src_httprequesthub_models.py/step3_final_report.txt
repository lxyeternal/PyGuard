{
  "purpose": "This code implements the core classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, including request preparation, URL encoding, header validation, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from user parameters such as method, url, headers, data, files, json, cookies, and hooks; data read from files or streams during request body preparation.",
  "sinks": "Generated request bytes sent over the network; response content processed and decoded; headers and cookies set for transmission.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> request construction (prepare methods) -> request encoding and validation -> network transmission -> response parsing and decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code follows standard patterns for HTTP handling with proper validation and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, with proper URL parsing, header validation, encoding, and response handling. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. External libraries used are standard and trusted. The code manages untrusted input safely, with validation and encoding, and handles errors gracefully. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP request and response handling, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk typical for such libraries.",
