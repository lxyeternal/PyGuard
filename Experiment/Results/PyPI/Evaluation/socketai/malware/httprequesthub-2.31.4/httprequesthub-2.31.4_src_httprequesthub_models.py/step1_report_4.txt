  "purpose": "This module provides classes and methods for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, enabling users to perform HTTP operations efficiently.",
  "sources": "Input sources include: method, url, headers, files, data, params, auth, cookies, hooks, json (from user input or programmatic parameters); URL parsing occurs within prepare_url; headers are set in prepare_headers; body data from data, files, json in prepare_body; cookies from cookies parameter; hooks from hooks parameter.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include: self.url (used in requests), self.headers (used in requests), self.body (sent over network), self.cookies (sent in headers), self._content (read and processed in response), self.raw (streamed content). Untrusted data can influence URL, headers, request body, and cookies, which are then transmitted or processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters (method, url, headers, data, files, json, cookies, hooks) through preparation methods (prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body, prepare_cookies, prepare_hooks) into the final request object, which is then sent over the network. Response content flows back into the response object, with methods like content, text, and json processing the response payload.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a requests library, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of external libraries like urllib3, chardet, and json is typical. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found. Hooks are straightforward. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms evident. Some methods handle untrusted inputs safely via encoding or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for HTTP request construction and response handling. Input parameters are managed and encoded appropriately. URL parsing includes validation and IDNA encoding, with error handling for invalid URLs. The request preparation process respects security standards by encoding data and managing headers properly. The response object manages content consumption, decoding, and error reporting securely, without evident malicious behavior. External libraries are used for encoding and JSON handling, consistent with common practices. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code handles untrusted data cautiously through encoding and validation, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard, expected behavior for HTTP request and response management within the Requests library. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to best practices for handling untrusted data and network communication, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
