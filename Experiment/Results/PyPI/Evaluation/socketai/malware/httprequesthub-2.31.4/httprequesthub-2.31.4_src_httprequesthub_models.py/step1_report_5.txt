{
  "purpose": "This module implements HTTP request and response handling for the Requests library, including request preparation, encoding, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL parsing, headers, JSON payloads, form data, files, cookies, and hooks. Data is read from request parameters, files, and raw response streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending request data (body, headers, cookies) to network, processing response content, decoding JSON, and reading from raw streams. Cookies and headers are set based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs such as URL, headers, data, files, and cookies into request objects, which prepare and encode data. Encoded data and headers flow to network via raw response streams. Response content is read and decoded, possibly involving JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Usage of encoding, JSON handling, and request preparation appears standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious network calls observed. Use of internal utils and third-party libraries is appropriate. Hooks are registered and deregistered normally. No anomalies indicating malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code handles HTTP request construction, including URL encoding, header validation, request body encoding (form data, files, JSON), cookie management, and request hooks. The response class manages response content reading, JSON decoding, header parsing, and status code evaluation. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, hidden network communication, or backdoors. The flow of data is consistent with standard HTTP handling, with proper checks and error handling. No suspicious patterns or behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard HTTP request and response handling for the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. No signs of supply chain malicious modifications or covert activities were detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
