  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard request/response handling with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Given the code's nature, these scores are reasonable. The low risk score reflects typical usage, and the malware score is justified as there are no malicious indicators.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's content. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard HTTP request/response logic with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still reasonable, given the nature of the code. No malware or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Continues to describe typical request/response handling, no malicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's purpose and content.  \n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard request/response code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent with the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is standard, with no malicious indicators.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.  \n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero inherent risks due to handling untrusted input. This is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal risk due to handling untrusted data, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP request/response handling within the 'requests' library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-implemented module suitable for supply chain security.",
