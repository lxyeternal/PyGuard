{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "targets": "The code outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data input is processed or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves a trusted CA bundle path and then it is printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of certifi library to obtain CA bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns a trusted CA bundle path. When executed as a script, it prints this path. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation, and no security-sensitive operations beyond retrieving a standard certificate bundle location. The code's simplicity indicates it is benign and does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a simple utility to output the trusted CA bundle path from certifi. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use in environments needing to identify CA certificates.",
