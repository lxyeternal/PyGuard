  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function is called and its output is printed to standard output; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward usage of a standard library function with no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a reputable package (certifi) to determine the path to a CA bundle. It simply prints this path when executed as a script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling. The code serves a specific, benign purpose, and relies entirely on external trusted libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, intended to output the location of the CA bundle provided by certifi. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
