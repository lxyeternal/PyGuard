{
  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library.",
  "sources": "The certifi.where() function call, which retrieves the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The script calls certifi.where() and outputs the result; no untrusted data input or external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses a well-known library, and performs a simple retrieval and print operation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi, which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. The code appears to be a utility for informational purposes. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It relies on a trusted third-party library (certifi) and does not handle untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply outputs the default CA bundle location, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a helper script for confirming CA bundle path and contains no malicious or suspicious activity.",
