  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and its invocation in the main block.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints the CA bundle path, which is a trusted resource.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It performs no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The code's purpose is purely informational, to display the trusted CA bundle path. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code relies on a reputable library and does not contain any suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The existing reports are accurate and the scores are justified.",
