  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The import of the 'where' function from the certifi package; the print statement that calls 'where()'.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where()' function to stdout.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path, which is then printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code straightforwardly returns and prints a trusted CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known package 'certifi' and calls its 'where' function to output the location of the CA bundle. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code's purpose appears to be simply informational or configuration-related. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and has no malicious intent. It only outputs the CA bundle location, which is standard practice for managing SSL/TLS certificates in Python environments.",
