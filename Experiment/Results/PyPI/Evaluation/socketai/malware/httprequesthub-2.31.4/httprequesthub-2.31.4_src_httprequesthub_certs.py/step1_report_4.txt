{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the certifi package: 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The print statement in the main block that outputs the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() as input -> print output of where() to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code simply calls a well-known library function and prints its result.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the CA bundle. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved, and there are no suspicious side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely to output the default CA bundle location. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
