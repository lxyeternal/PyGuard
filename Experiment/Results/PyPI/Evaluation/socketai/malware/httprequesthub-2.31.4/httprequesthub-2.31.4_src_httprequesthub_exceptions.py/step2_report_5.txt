  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions.  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- The code imports external exceptions but does not process untrusted data or execute any code based on external input.  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard exception hierarchy for the Requests library.\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are apparent.  \n- The analysis appropriately notes the absence of data flows, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue.**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the lack of security concerns.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code structure.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \n- No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is purely class definitions with no runtime or dynamic behavior.  \n- The reports correctly assign low risk scores.\n\n**5. Pay attention to the malware score.**  \n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.  \n- No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.**  \n- The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.  \n- No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n**7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report.**  \n- The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard exception class module for the Requests library. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no external system interaction, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo changes needed; the current assessments are accurate.",
