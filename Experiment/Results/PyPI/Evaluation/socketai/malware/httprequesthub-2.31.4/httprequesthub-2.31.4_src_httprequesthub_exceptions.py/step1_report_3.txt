  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; exception class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no system command execution, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines exception classes without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard exception class definitions without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for a Python HTTP library. It imports dependencies, defines custom exception classes with inheritance, and provides docstrings. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external interactions that could indicate malicious intent. The code structure, import patterns, and class definitions are typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
