  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code defines classes and imports external exception types; no direct input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; no system interactions or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling within the requests library. It imports exceptions, defines custom exceptions, and adds docstrings for clarity. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure is standard for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definitions module for the Requests library with no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks detected.",
