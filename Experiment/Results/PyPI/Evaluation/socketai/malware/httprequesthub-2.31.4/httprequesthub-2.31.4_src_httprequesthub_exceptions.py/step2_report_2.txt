  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard exception definitions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; exception classes are standard, imported exceptions are from well-known modules, no dynamic or suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard class definitions, no dynamic operations, no external data processing, no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, typical error handling code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Class definitions with attribute initializations based on parameters and response objects. No external input processing or malicious logic.  \n- **Assessment:** Legitimate exception class code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, exception classes, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Standard error handling code, safe.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code contains no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no external data processing or dynamic code, the overall security risk is minimal, justified at 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0 for all reports.  \n- **Confidence:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
