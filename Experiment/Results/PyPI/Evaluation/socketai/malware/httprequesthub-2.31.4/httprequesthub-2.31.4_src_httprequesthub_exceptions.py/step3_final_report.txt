{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling request errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Class initializations and attribute access within exception constructors; import statements for external exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes without processing external input.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow, only class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for the Requests library, importing external exceptions and establishing custom exceptions. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, network interactions, or obfuscation. The code is static, well-structured, and standard for error handling modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes are typical and do not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
