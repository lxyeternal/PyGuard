  "purpose": "Dependency validation, version checks, SSL fallback setup, and environment configuration for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Version variables imported from dependencies, environment detection code, SSL module import, cryptography version check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; primarily version assertions and warnings.",
  "flows": "Dependency version variables are read and validated; warnings are issued based on these values; SSL fallback logic executes based on environment detection.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard dependency and environment setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency version checks, compatibility assertions, SSL fallback handling, and suppresses certain warnings. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations with untrusted sources, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The use of assertions and warnings is typical for dependency validation. SSL fallback via pyopenssl is a known compatibility measure. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured dependency and environment setup module for the requests library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to dependency validation routines, which are standard practice.",
