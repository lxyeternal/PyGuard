  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs dependency version checks, compatibility assertions, SSL fallback setup, and imports internal modules.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- Warnings are issued for dependency mismatches, and some suppression of warnings occurs.\n- No dynamic code execution, network-based malicious activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The code is standard for a library setup module.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Standard dependency validation, version checks, SSL fallback.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** Uses warnings/assertions based on dependency versions; SSL fallback via pyopenssl.\n\n**Anomalies:** No malicious code, just dependency checks and environment setup.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, standard setup code, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to dependency validation)\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence (0.9) is justified; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Similar dependency validation and compatibility checks.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; standard configuration.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious code; standard procedures.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup code, very low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Assessment:** Confidence 1 is justified; no malicious concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Dependency checks, version validation, SSL fallback.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input; standard warnings and imports.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; normal dependency validation.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup routines, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Assessment:** Confidence 0.9 is justified; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Dependency validation, environment setup.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; dependency checks.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious code; suppression of warnings is standard.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup code, very low security concern.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Confidence 0.9 justified; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Dependency management, compatibility, SSL configuration.\n\n**Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious sinks; standard dependency validation.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; normal environment setup.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine setup code, minimal security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Confidence 0.9 justified; no malicious concerns.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the dependency validation and environment configuration, which are standard but could, in theory, be exploited if dependencies are compromised.\n\n**Given the nature of the code, I would agree with the assigned scores.**\n\n---\n\n## Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate for dependency validation code)\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, well-structured setup module with no signs of malicious intent.",
