{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup procedures for a Python package, including dependency management, custom commands, and post-installation actions.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', fetching README.md, URL-encoded base64 string for remote URL and code execution, and potentially executing subprocesses.",
  "sinks": "Executing subprocesses with code decoded from base64, opening URLs, and potentially running arbitrary code received over the network.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded URL decoded and fetched during egg_info command → response read and executed via subprocess → potential remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obscure URLs and code, dynamic code execution via subprocess with decoded content, fetching and executing code from a remote server, hardcoded base64-encoded URL, and use of potentially unsafe subprocess creation flags.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations but contains suspicious elements such as decoding a base64 string which points to a remote URL and executing the fetched content via subprocess. This indicates potential remote code execution (RCE). The base64 string decodes to a URL 'https://gist.github.com/KarayevAlexei/bdf4f9e280714d87303d4909d19de3a7/raw/3163e9c9ff618c50a8d8a9f60053a3683895e351/mac.db64', and the code attempts to download and run it. Other parts of the code are benign, but the remote code fetch and execution are highly suspicious and could be malicious. The code also reads the version info and README files normally, with no evidence of obfuscation there.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior through fetching and executing remote code encoded in base64, which poses a significant security risk. This behavior indicates the presence of a backdoor or malicious remote code execution mechanism within the package setup process.",
