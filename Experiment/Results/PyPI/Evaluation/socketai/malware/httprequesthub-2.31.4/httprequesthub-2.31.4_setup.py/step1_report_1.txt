  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including custom commands and dependencies management.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', reading README.md, urllib.request.urlopen for fetching remote data, os.system calls for publishing.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen for remote code execution, subprocess.Popen for executing decoded remote content, os.system for publishing commands.",
  "flows": "Remote URL response decoded and executed via subprocess in PostEggInfoCommand; version info read from file; setup configuration uses version and author info.",
  "anomalies": "Base64 decoding and remote URL fetch in PostEggInfoCommand; execution of remote content; use of os.system for package publishing; reading version info from file with exec.",
  "analysis": "The script includes standard setup logic with dependency management and custom command classes. The PostEggInfoCommand decodes a base64 string, fetches data from a remote URL, decodes it, and executes the result via subprocess, which can be malicious if the remote content is harmful. The use of base64 and remote code execution indicates potential malicious intent or supply chain attack risk. The rest of the code is typical for a setup.py, but the remote code execution logic is suspicious. No other malicious behaviors such as data theft or backdoors are evident. The remote code fetch and execution represent a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious remote code fetch and execution in the PostEggInfoCommand class, which could be exploited to run arbitrary code during installation. The rest of the script is standard for package setup but is overshadowed by this suspicious activity.",
