  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, handling dependencies, version checks, and post-install actions.",
  "sources": "Python version info, urllib request responses, base64-encoded URLs, package data files, and potentially dynamic subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen call executing dynamically decoded code, urllib request fetching potentially remote content, execution of code via exec() on version file, system commands via os.system.",
  "flows": "Version check reads Python version; base64 URL fetch reads remote code; exec reads version info; subprocess executes decoded remote code; os.system runs shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding and executing remote code via base64 and urllib, using exec() on version file, dynamically launching processes based on remote content, no explicit hardcoded credentials but risky remote code execution points.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with version validation and dependency management. However, it includes a potentially malicious remote code fetch in PostEggInfoCommand class, where a base64-encoded URL is decoded and fetched, then executed in a subprocess with a dynamic command. The use of exec() to run code fetched over the network can be malicious if the remote server is compromised or malicious. The rest of the code appears to handle package configuration securely, with no other obvious malicious intent. The subprocess invocation with decoded content is a significant concern, as it could execute arbitrary remote code. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets or backdoors outside this remote fetch and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a potentially malicious remote code fetch and execution mechanism via base64-encoded URL and exec(), which could lead to remote code execution upon package installation. Other parts of the code are standard package setup code, with no further suspicious activity.",
