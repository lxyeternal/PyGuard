  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and sends it to a specified server endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), OS name via platform.system(), and IP address via socket.gethostbyname(hostname).",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to an external server using requests.post().",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, osname, ip) → Data dictionary → requests.post() endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded external server URL. No user input or environment variables involved. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details and transmits them to a specified server URL. The URL appears to be a Pipedream endpoint, which could be used for legitimate monitoring or potentially for malicious tracking if used without user consent. The code itself does not perform malicious actions such as system modification, data exfiltration beyond the info collected, or network connections to malicious domains. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected. The data transmission could be privacy-invasive if used maliciously, but the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to collect basic system info and send it to an external server. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. However, it could be used for unauthorized tracking or data collection if deployed without user consent. No security vulnerabilities are evident within this scope.",
