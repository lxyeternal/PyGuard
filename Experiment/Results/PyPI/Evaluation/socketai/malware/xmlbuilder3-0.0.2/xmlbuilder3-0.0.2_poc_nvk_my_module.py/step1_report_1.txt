  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and send it to a specified server endpoint.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), the 'server_url' variable",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function, which transmits data over the network to an external URL",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system calls and then sent directly via POST request to the specified server URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The server URL is hardcoded but appears to be a test endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system info—hostname, OS name, and IP address—using standard libraries. It then attempts to send this data via an HTTP POST request to a predefined server URL. The process includes basic error handling. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration of sensitive information, command execution, or malicious payloads. The server URL points to a test endpoint, likely for demonstration or testing purposes. The code's behavior could be considered privacy-sensitive if used without user consent, but technically, it only collects publicly accessible system info. Overall, the code performs straightforward data collection and transmission with no malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply collects basic system information and transmits it to an external server. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators. The network activity could be privacy-intrusive if used improperly, but there are no signs of malicious payloads or malicious intent in the code itself.",
