  "purpose": "Collects hostname, OS name, and IP address of the host and sends this information to a specified server URL.",

  "flows": "Sources (hostname, OS, IP) -> Data packaging -> POST request to server URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded server URL potentially for data exfiltration; no validation or obfuscation of data; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information such as hostname, OS name, and IP address without validation or user consent. It then sends this data to a fixed URL using an HTTP POST request. The server URL appears to be a public endpoint, possibly for malicious data collection or reconnaissance. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic is present. The code's intent seems to be passive data collection, which could be used maliciously if deployed without user knowledge. The absence of input validation, encryption, or user prompts indicates a focus on stealth data gathering.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple system information collection and transmits it to a fixed URL, which could be used for malicious surveillance or reconnaissance. No direct malware behavior or malicious backdoors are present, but the purpose and context could pose privacy concerns. The overall security risk is low but with potential privacy implications if used maliciously.",
