{
  "purpose": "Collects system hostname, OS name, and IP address, then sends this data via HTTP POST to a specified server URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "requests.post(server_url, json=data)",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows directly into the POST request to the server URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond the server URL; URL appears to be a test endpoint; no user consent prompts or validation; no obfuscation or malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly gathers basic system info and transmits it over HTTPS to a hardcoded URL. It uses standard libraries and handles exceptions minimally. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration of sensitive info, backdoors, or obfuscation. The server URL is a test endpoint, indicating likely purpose for testing or demonstration. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the privacy implications are noted but do not constitute malicious activity. The security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to privacy concerns, but no active threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple system info collection and transmission without malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary concern is privacy invasion if used without user consent, but this does not classify as malware. The assigned scores are consistent with the behavior, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2).",
