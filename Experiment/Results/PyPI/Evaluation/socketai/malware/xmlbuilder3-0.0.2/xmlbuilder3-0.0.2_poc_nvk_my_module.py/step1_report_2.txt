{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and sends it to a specified server URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "requests.post(server_url, json=data)",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources, then sent via POST request to the server URL.",
  "anomalies": "The server URL is hardcoded; data collection and transmission are straightforward with no encryption or user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information and sends it to a remote server without user consent or notification. The URL appears to be a test or proof-of-concept endpoint, but it could be used maliciously to exfiltrate host info. The data transmission uses HTTPS, which is secure in transit, but the purpose of the data collection and its potential misuse is unclear. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code functions as a data exfiltration tool, which could be used maliciously, but on its own, it does not contain malicious code or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to gather and transmit system information to a remote server, potentially for malicious data collection or reconnaissance. While it does not contain malicious code per se, its behavior is suspicious in contexts where user awareness and consent are absent. It has a low malware likelihood but warrants caution due to its potential misuse.",
