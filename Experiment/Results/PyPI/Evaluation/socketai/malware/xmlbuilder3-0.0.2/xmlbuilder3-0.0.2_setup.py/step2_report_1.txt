  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the key behavior: the setup script executes `subprocess.run([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"poc_nvk.my_module\"])` during installation.\n- The execution of an internal module (`poc_nvk.my_module`) during setup is unusual and potentially malicious.\n- The reports correctly highlight the risk of executing arbitrary code during install without validation or user consent.\n- The code snippets provided in the reports do not show the import of `sys`, which is necessary for `sys.executable` to work. This suggests the code might be incomplete or intentionally obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Execution of `poc_nvk.my_module` during installation** via subprocess, which could run malicious code if the module is harmful.\n- **Lack of validation or sandboxing** before executing the module.\n- **Potential incomplete or faulty code** (missing `import sys`) that would cause runtime errors, but this could be intentional or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports assume `poc_nvk.my_module` could be malicious, which is valid, but without inspecting the module's content, we cannot definitively label it malicious.\n- The mention of `sys.executable` without importing `sys` indicates the code might be incomplete or intentionally obfuscated. This should be clarified.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score**: Given the behavior (automatic execution of a module during install), a malware score of around **0.5 to 0.6** is reasonable if there's suspicion of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which seems appropriate as the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score**: The scores range from 0.6 to 0.75, which seem justified given the potential for malicious code execution.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should be **at least 0.5**, possibly higher if there's suspicion of malicious intent.\n- The **security risk** score should reflect the severity of executing arbitrary code during install; scores around **0.7** are justified.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains 0 unless there's evidence of obfuscation, which isn't indicated here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The core concern is the **automatic execution of `poc_nvk.my_module` during setup**, which can be exploited to run malicious code.\n- The code's missing `import sys` suggests possible obfuscation or incomplete code, which warrants caution.\n- Without access to the module's content, we cannot confirm maliciousness, but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant a high security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Reasoning                                                                                     | Final Value  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Malware Score    | Execution of arbitrary module during install, potential for malicious payloads             | **0.6**     |\n| Obfuscated Score | No evidence of obfuscation in the provided snippets, but code behavior is suspicious          | **0**       |\n| Risk Score       | High due to automatic execution of code during install, which can be exploited maliciously | **0.75**    |\n\n**Note:** The high risk score reflects the security concern of executing unvalidated code during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The behavior warrants caution, and further inspection of `poc_nvk.my_module` is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code.",
