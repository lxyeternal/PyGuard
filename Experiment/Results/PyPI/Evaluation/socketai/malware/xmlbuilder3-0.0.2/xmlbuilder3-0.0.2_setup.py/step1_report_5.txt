{
  "purpose": "The setup script installs a Python package named 'xmlbuilder3' and executes a custom post-install command that runs a module 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (implicitly used in subprocess), package data (not specified), and the module 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing 'poc_nvk.my_module', which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The install process runs 'poc_nvk.my_module' after installation, potentially executing untrusted code if the module contains malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically runs a module immediately after installation without any security checks or user confirmation. The module 'poc_nvk.my_module' is invoked via subprocess without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after completing the normal installation, runs a module 'poc_nvk.my_module' using subprocess. This behavior could be malicious if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains harmful code, as it executes automatically upon package installation. There are no checks or validations to prevent malicious code execution. The package setup appears standard, but the post-install behavior is suspicious. The code does not reveal hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, but the automatic execution of arbitrary modules during install is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes an external module immediately after installation, which could contain malicious code. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a security risk if 'poc_nvk.my_module' is malicious or compromised.",
