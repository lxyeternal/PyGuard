  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if the module contains malicious code. The missing 'import sys' suggests incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code, increasing suspicion. The pattern of executing arbitrary code during setup is a common supply chain attack vector. Scores reflect high potential for malicious activity and security concern, with malware score around 0.6 and risk score around 0.75. Further inspection of the module is recommended before use."
