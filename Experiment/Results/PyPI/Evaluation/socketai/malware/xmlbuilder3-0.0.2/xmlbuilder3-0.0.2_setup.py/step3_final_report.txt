{
  "purpose": "The setup script executes 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation via subprocess, which could run malicious code.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing [sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module'] after install.run(self).",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'poc_nvk.my_module' during setup, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "After standard installation, the code runs subprocess with the current Python interpreter to execute 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "anomalies": "Missing 'import sys' before using 'sys.executable', causing a runtime error; execution during install is suspicious; hardcoded module name.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to run 'poc_nvk.my_module' via subprocess during setup, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The absence of 'import sys' indicates incomplete or obfuscated code, likely causing errors. The pattern of executing external code during install is a common tactic for malicious packages. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.5-0.6, security risk 0.6-0.75) are appropriate given the behavior. The high risk stems from executing unvalidated code during install, which can be exploited. Without inspecting 'poc_nvk.my_module', we cannot confirm maliciousness, but the behavior warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if the module contains malicious code. The missing 'import sys' suggests incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code, increasing suspicion. The pattern of executing arbitrary code during setup is a common supply chain attack vector. Scores reflect high potential for malicious activity and security concern, with malware score around 0.6 and risk score around 0.75. Further inspection of the module is recommended before use.",
