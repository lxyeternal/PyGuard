{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'xmlbuilder3' and include a custom installation step that executes a module post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package metadata, and uses subprocess.run to execute a Python module after installation.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call can execute arbitrary code contained in 'poc_nvk.my_module', potentially leading to malicious behavior if that module is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code triggers subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module']), which executes the specified module, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The subprocess call executes a module immediately after installation without validation, which is unusual and could be malicious if the module is harmful. The code does not validate or restrict what 'poc_nvk.my_module' does.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports setuptools for package configuration and defines a custom install class that extends the standard install command. The run method in CustomInstall calls the standard run method and then executes a subprocess that runs 'poc_nvk.my_module'. This behavior is unusual because executing a module post-installation without user consent or explicit validation can be malicious. The module's code is not shown, so its contents and intent are unknown. There are no other suspicious elements such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The script could be used maliciously to execute harmful code on the user's system during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a standard package setup but includes a potentially malicious behavior: executing an internal module immediately after installation. Without validation or explicit user consent, this behavior poses a security risk, especially if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains malicious code.",
