{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the 'sys' module (via sys.executable) and subprocess module.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executes a command using Python interpreter with module 'poc_nvk.my_module', which is invoked during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, subprocess.run executes [sys.executable, '-m', 'poc_nvk.my_module'], potentially executing arbitrary code from 'poc_nvk.my_module'.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically executes a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') during install without validation or user consent; 'sys' module is used but not imported, indicating incomplete or faulty code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup and defines a custom install class that overrides 'run' to execute an external module during installation. The 'subprocess.run' command dynamically runs a module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter, which could be malicious if the module contains harmful code. The code lacks an import statement for 'sys', which would cause runtime errors, suggesting incomplete or potentially manipulated code. The execution of a module during install is suspicious because it could run malicious payloads automatically. No other suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main concern is the execution of an external module during installation, which could be malicious if 'poc_nvk.my_module' contains harmful code. The absence of 'import sys' indicates possible incomplete code or a potential security risk if modified. Overall, the script executes code during setup without validation, representing a security concern.",
