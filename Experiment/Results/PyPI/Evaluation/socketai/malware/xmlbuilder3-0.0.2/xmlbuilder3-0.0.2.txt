      "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'poc_nvk.my_module' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if the module contains malicious code. The missing 'import sys' suggests incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code, increasing suspicion. The pattern of executing arbitrary code during setup is a common supply chain attack vector. Scores reflect high potential for malicious activity and security concern, with malware score around 0.6 and risk score around 0.75. Further inspection of the module is recommended before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple system info collection and transmission without malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary concern is privacy invasion if used without user consent, but this does not classify as malware. The assigned scores are consistent with the behavior, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."
