  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines proxy connection classes with no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and standard socket handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, indicating minimal concern.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard proxy URL creation and socket handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, slightly higher but still low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy connector with configurable options, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy handling, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, standard proxy management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, standard for proxy handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting typical configuration complexity but no real security concern.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Consistency:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Could be marginally increased to 0.1–0.2 if desired, but current values are reasonable.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, well-structured proxy connector with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (current 0.2 is acceptable)\n\nThis review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
