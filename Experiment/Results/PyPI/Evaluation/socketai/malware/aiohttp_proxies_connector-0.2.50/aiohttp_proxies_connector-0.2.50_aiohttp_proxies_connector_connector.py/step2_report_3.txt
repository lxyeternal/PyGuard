  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a proxy connector with no suspicious behaviors, standard URL construction, and socket handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, URL construction, and socket creation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, considering the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of suspicious behaviors, with accurate reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy configuration, socket creation, and the NoResolver class. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is solid; no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard proxy connection handling, URL formation, and socket management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent purpose and implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, matching the code clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2) is reasonable given the code's functionality; no evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code does handle proxy URLs with embedded credentials, which could be sensitive if user input is untrusted. However, this is standard practice, and the code does not demonstrate any malicious handling or obfuscation.\n- The use of `NoResolver` could be exploited to bypass DNS checks, but in this context, it appears to be an intentional feature, not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.2, considering the potential for misuse if user input is untrusted, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no active threat present)\n\nThis concludes the review.",
