  "purpose": "Define a custom proxy connector class for aiohttp with support for different proxy types and custom DNS resolution.",
  "sources": "import socket; from .helpers import create_socket_wrapper, parse_proxy_url; from .proto import ProxyType",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily handles socket creation, URL formatting, and proxy connection management.",
  "flows": "Proxy configuration data (host, port, username, password) is used to construct proxy URLs and sockets; socket wrappers are created for proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors. Proxy URL construction and socket wrapping are standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NoResolver class for bypassing DNS resolution, a ProxyConnector class for managing proxy connections with support for HTTP and non-HTTP proxies, and URL construction methods. It uses helper functions for parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers, and handles connection setup based on proxy type. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for proxy management in an HTTP client context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a proxy connector with no evidence of malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It manages proxy URLs and socket connections securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows.",
