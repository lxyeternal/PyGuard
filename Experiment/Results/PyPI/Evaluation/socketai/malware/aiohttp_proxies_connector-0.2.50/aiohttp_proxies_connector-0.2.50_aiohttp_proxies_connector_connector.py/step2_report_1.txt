  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code behavior with the provided source code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a proxy connector with no suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report accurately describes the code's functionality: proxy URL construction, socket wrapping, and connection management.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code: dynamic proxy URL creation, socket handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still within reasonable bounds.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard proxy connection code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code's logic is straightforward: proxy URL parsing, socket creation, connection management.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- Risk score of 0.2 is acceptable for a network connection handler.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard proxy handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent with the code.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk score remains reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard proxy management, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The description matches the code's functionality.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to be a typical proxy connector implementation. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is evident.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all within reasonable bounds given the code's network connection handling nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (average, considering the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but no inherent vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** Since the code involves network connections and URL handling, a minimal risk score (0.2) is appropriate, but no higher, as there's no evidence of malicious or dangerous behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1, but 0.2 remains acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code and reports.",
