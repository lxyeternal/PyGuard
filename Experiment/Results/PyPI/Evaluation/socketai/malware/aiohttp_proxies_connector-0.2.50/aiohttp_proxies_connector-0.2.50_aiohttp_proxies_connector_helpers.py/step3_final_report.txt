{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create proxy socket wrappers, and establish network connections via asyncio, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url, user-supplied parameters for host, port, proxy URL, and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network connection establishment via asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection, socket connection via sock.connect.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters → parse_proxy_url or direct parameters → create_socket_wrapper → connect socket → open asyncio connection or create connection with socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Input validation is appropriate. No unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection handling, with proper validation, exception handling, and use of established libraries. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and potential misuse scenarios, which are typical for proxy client modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the potential for misuse via user-supplied inputs but does not indicate inherent vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
