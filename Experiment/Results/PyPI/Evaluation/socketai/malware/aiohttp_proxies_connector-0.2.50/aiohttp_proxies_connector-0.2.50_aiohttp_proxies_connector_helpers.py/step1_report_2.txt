{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous functions to create network connections via SOCKS proxy servers, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "URL parsing in parse_proxy_url, user input for host, port, and proxy URL parameters, environment variables indirectly via default proxy configurations.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection, socket connections, connect method on Socks wrapper objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (proxy URLs, host, port, credentials) flows through parse_proxy_url and create_socket_wrapper to establish a socket, then through connect methods to reach target hosts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. Proxy URL parsing and socket creation are standard. No evident data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for parsing proxy URLs, creating SOCKS proxy sockets, and establishing network connections through proxies asynchronously. It correctly handles input parameters, including optional credentials, and raises appropriate errors on invalid data. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are evident. The use of standard libraries and well-structured logic suggests typical utility code for network operations. No indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for establishing proxy-based network connections. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided content. The implementation follows standard practices without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
