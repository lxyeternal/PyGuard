{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers to establish network connections through proxies asynchronously, supporting different authentication methods and address types.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from network socket responses, user-supplied host and port, and data passed to send methods.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the proxy server, receives data from the proxy server, potentially untrusted address data, and user credentials during authentication.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, user credentials) flows into connection and authentication requests, which are sent to the proxy server; responses from the proxy server are received and processed, influencing further socket operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of socket APIs and address resolution appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed. No network exfiltration or malicious command execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based networking, including both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It handles address resolution, different authentication schemes, and socket management properly. No malicious or suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual data flows. The code adheres to expected socket and network communication patterns without evidence of tampering or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs typical network proxy operations securely and as intended.",
