{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for network communication, supporting connection establishment, negotiation, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets using sock_recv, and hostnames are resolved via getaddrinfo. Input data for requests is constructed internally from parameters such as hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets with sock_sendall. Potential untrusted data could be the host and port inputs, or user credentials used in authentication, which could lead to information leakage if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Host and port data from external input are used to resolve addresses, then incorporated into proxy request packets. Authentication credentials are included in request payloads, and responses from the proxy server are parsed to determine success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs request packets with explicit encoding, uses byte manipulations for protocol compliance, and performs local or remote DNS resolution. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The use of multiple protocols appears standard for SOCKS proxies.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical patterns for implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy communication. It performs address resolution, constructs protocol-specific request packets, manages authentication where applicable, and handles responses and errors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behavior are detected. The inclusion of user credentials is optional and handled securely. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns are observed. The structure is straightforward and consistent with common proxy implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with proper handling of connections, authentication, and address resolution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. It adheres to expected protocols and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
