  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic and behavior with the code snippet, and then evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Correctly describes the code as SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers, handling authentication, address resolution, and socket management. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, typical for proxy code)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's reasoning aligns well with the code. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- The scores seem reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard socket operations, hostname resolution, and proxy negotiation. No malicious indicators.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The logical reasoning matches the code. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the implementation, with proper handling of protocols, address resolution, and authentication. No malicious behavior or backdoors.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent with the code. No suspicious or malicious patterns.  \n- Scores are justified.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Describes the code as standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity. Addresses potential DNS leaks but notes this is typical for proxy code.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing correct protocol handling, optional credentials, and no obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis matches the code. No issues identified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting the inherent risks of proxy code (e.g., DNS leaks, credential handling), but nothing suspicious in the code itself.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers using asyncio.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content and the reports' reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard for proxy code, considering potential misuse or misconfiguration)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and justified. No changes necessary.",
