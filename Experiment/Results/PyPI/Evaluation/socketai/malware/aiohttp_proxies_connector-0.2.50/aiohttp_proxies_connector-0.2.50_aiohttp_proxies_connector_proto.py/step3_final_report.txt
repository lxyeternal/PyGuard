  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including address resolution, authentication, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy server and destination; socket send and receive functions; address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Socket data transmission functions; socket connection establishment; address resolution outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port) -> address resolution -> socket connection -> proxy negotiation -> data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows, no backdoors or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies using asyncio. It handles connection setup, authentication, and address resolution with appropriate error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are present. The data flows are typical for proxy clients, and no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or remote command execution are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is low, and the absence of obfuscation or malware is confirmed. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.",
