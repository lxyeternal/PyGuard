{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, facilitating connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network sockets using self._loop.sock_recv, input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and address resolution functions. Data is also obtained via socket operations and user-supplied parameters for connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for sending and receiving data, including sock_sendall and sock_recv, which could transmit or receive data. There are no evident data leaks or sensitive data transmission to untrusted external destinations within this code alone.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are processed, resolved, and used to build requests, which are then sent through network sockets. Responses are received and parsed, with control flow based on response validation, indicating standard proxy negotiation flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code uses standard network and socket APIs with proper exception handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is observed. The code performs standard proxy negotiation procedures without unusual or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously. It performs address resolution, manages proxy authentication (including username/password for SOCKS5), and establishes connections through proxies with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or remote command execution. All data flows appear consistent with typical proxy connection procedures. Usage of network functions and socket operations aligns with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asynchronous networking. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to expected patterns for such functionality and does not contain any covert or harmful features.",
