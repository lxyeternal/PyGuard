{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from socket responses, user credentials (if provided), and network address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from socket responses (e.g., proxy server replies), user credentials, and address inputs into socket communication and processing functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from socket responses and input parameters (host, port, credentials) through negotiation functions, influencing connection establishment and address handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; exception handling is standard. No signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network connections. The code adheres to typical proxy communication protocols and performs expected operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS proxy connections with detailed handling for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It utilizes standard socket and asyncio features, with proper exception handling and validation of protocol responses. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data theft, covert channels, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy socket wrappers, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy communication wrappers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors and follows protocol specifications properly.",
