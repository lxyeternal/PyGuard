{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous network communication through proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket connections (_loop.sock_recv, _loop.sock_sendall), hostnames and ports from method parameters, and internal data for proxy negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sockets (via _send, sendall), network connections, and resolves hostnames which could lead to DNS leaks if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, authentication info) flows into socket connection and proxy negotiation functions; socket data flows out during network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens present; use of standard library functions for DNS resolution; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Error handling is standard; no suspicious network behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. It handles socket connection, hostname resolution, and proxy negotiation following protocol specifications. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Error handling is routine, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code could potentially leak DNS information if misused, but that is typical for network proxy code and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected proxy negotiation and connection functions with no malicious signals detected.",
