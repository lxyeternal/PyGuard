  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the provided code and the report summaries.\n\n---\n\n### **General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are noted.\n- The data flows are typical for proxy clients: host/port resolution, request construction, socket communication.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- Error handling appears standard and appropriate.\n- The code seems to follow protocol specifications correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific issues and scoring considerations:**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious activity or code.\n- Given the code's nature—proxy wrappers—malicious activity would be unusual unless embedded with hidden backdoors or malicious payloads.\n- No such indicators are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, citing no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscation techniques.\n- No hidden or misleading code is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Score:**\n- The reports assign a low risk score (~0.2), indicating minimal security concerns.\n- Potential concerns could include DNS leaks, credential handling, or protocol misuse.\n- The code handles credentials securely (no hardcoded secrets), and error handling is routine.\n- No evident vulnerabilities or dangerous behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk score of **0.2** seems appropriate and should stay.\n\n---\n\n### **Any logical flaws or errors in the reports?**\n\n- The reports consistently state that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.\n- They acknowledge potential DNS leaks, which are typical for proxy code but not inherently malicious.\n- No report suggests any actual vulnerability or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- The reasoning in the reports appears sound.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score / Comment                                                  |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0** — No malicious activity detected                            |\n| Obfuscated        | **0** — Code is clear, no obfuscation present                     |\n| Security Risk     | **0.2** — Low, typical proxy operation risks, no evident vulnerabilities |\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\nThe provided code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers. It does not exhibit malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's characteristics.\n\n**I recommend keeping the scores as they are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized report or further analyze any specific aspect?**",
