  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrapper with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears standard and well-structured.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe report correctly identifies no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and a low security risk. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The risk score of 0.2 seems to reflect minor concerns about potential misconfigurations or misuse but is not overly high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it notes standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS proxies with proper handling, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's apparent functionality. No malicious activity detected, and the risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; the code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check and Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The code handles proxy negotiation, address resolution, and socket management as expected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** While DNS leaks are possible in proxy code, this is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (0.2). This is consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minor concerns like potential misuse or misconfiguration but not significant.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2**  \n\nThe provided reports are accurate and well-justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
