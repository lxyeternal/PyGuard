{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports components related to a proxy connection library, including error handling, connection helpers, and protocol definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present",
  "flows": "Imports load code components; no runtime data flow or user input handling is evident",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version declaration, and exporting symbols via __all__. No runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling occurs. All imported modules appear to be internal components related to proxy connections and error management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure follows standard Python module export patterns. No anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module initialization and export file for a proxy handling library. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is a straightforward and benign code fragment.",
