{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module for a SOCKS proxy client or connector, exposing classes and functions related to proxy connection handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; it imports modules and defines exported classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or file operations are directly performed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module version declaration, and defining the __all__ list for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations itself. All imported modules appear to be standard for a proxy-related library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. Therefore, there is no evidence of malware or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It only defines and exports classes and functions, without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
