{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python module providing SOCKS proxy functionality, including connection handling, error definitions, and proxy type enumeration.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; the code mainly imports and exports symbols",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input processing observed; it only defines and exposes components",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily responsible for defining and exporting classes, functions, and constants related to a proxy connection module. It imports local modules and sets up the module's public interface. There are no data handling, input processing, network connections, or code execution mechanisms within this fragment. The structure is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It serves as an interface and import/export setup for the package's internal components, with no active logic or data processing that could be exploited.",
