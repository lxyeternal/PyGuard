  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library.\n- They consistently find no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is primarily import/export boilerplate, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The malware scores are all zero, and the security risk scores are very low or zero.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating strong agreement among reviewers.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports internal modules related to proxy connection handling and error classes, then exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or code execution.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since all reviewers agree and the code is straightforward, there are no logical flaws or reasoning errors to challenge.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or near-zero) are appropriate given the code content.\n- The purpose of the code is purely to set up module exports, with no active logic that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard module initialization file for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The overall risk score should be very low, around 0 to 0.1, consistent with the reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (negligible, just because it's a module setup with no active logic)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a typical, benign module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
