  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup, mainly importing internal components and defining exports.\n   - No evidence of data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign module setup for a proxy library.\n   - No overstatements or unwarranted security concerns are present.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0 or very close to zero\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score.\n   - The code is purely import/export setup, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n   - Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make baseless assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns.\n   - Their reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Content:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks are evident in this module setup.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's nature, which is a standard module initialization for a proxy library, the risk is negligible. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard Python module that imports internal components and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
