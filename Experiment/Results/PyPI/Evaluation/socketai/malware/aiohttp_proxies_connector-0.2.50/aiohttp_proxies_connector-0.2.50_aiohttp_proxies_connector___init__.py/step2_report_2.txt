  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a standard Python module initialization script (`__init__.py`-like), importing internal modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, `.helpers`, `.proto`) and defining the module's public interface via `__all__`.\n   - There are no functions, network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The version string is straightforward (`\"0.1.2\"`).\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - No suspicious network activity, external data handling, or code obfuscation.\n   - The code appears to be a typical package setup for a SOCKS proxy client library.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Report Logic and Scores:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard module setup.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior or malicious intent that warrants higher scores.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely import/export declarations, the risk is minimal.\n   - Even if the internal modules (`.connector`, `.errors`, etc.) could contain vulnerabilities, this specific snippet does not provide evidence of that.\n   - Therefore, the overall risk and malware scores should remain very low or zero.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are accurate and justified based on the provided code and analysis.
