  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python module (likely an `__init__.py`) that imports various classes, functions, and constants from internal modules related to SOCKS proxy handling.\n- It defines the module version and explicitly sets the public API via `__all__`.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. This aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this is a benign module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Scores given (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and a very low security risk (mostly 0 or 0.1). These seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious logic, such as code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Security risk score (~0.1):**  \n  The minimal risk score reflects the fact that this code, by itself, poses no security threat. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly assume that the code is purely structural, with no hidden malicious intent.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made; only that the code is benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or similar very low value)\n\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard module setup)\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
