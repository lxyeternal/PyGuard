  "purpose": "This module provides proxy connection utilities, error classes, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections, likely for network communication or routing.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from within the same package (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data input or user-provided data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data, execute system commands, or perform network activity directly. It only defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; it mainly establishes module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The version string and exported names are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package module defining imports and exports. It imports classes and functions that likely handle network proxy connections and errors. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure appears standard for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious module file defining and exporting proxy connection utilities and error classes. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior based on the provided content.",
