{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file for a SOCKS proxy client library, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network activity present",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration establish source-to-export flow; no runtime data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing internal classes and functions related to SOCKS proxy handling, then exposing them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All review reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script for a SOCKS proxy library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
