{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy client library, setting up imports and module exports for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data handling is present; code primarily imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no input/output handling or data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious domain connections, or hidden backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection library, importing various classes and functions from internal modules and defining module exports. No input reading, data handling, or network activities are directly present. The code structure appears conventional, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization segment, importing components and exposing them for external use. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
