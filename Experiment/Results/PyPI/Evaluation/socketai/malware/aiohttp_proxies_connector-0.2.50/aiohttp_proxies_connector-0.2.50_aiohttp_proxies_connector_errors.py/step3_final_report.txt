  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no data input, output, or network operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy error exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, static, and standard for error handling modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
