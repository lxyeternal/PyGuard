  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard exceptions, serving as structured error indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high, justified)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n     - Malware: 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions for exception handling, the risk should remain at 0.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No overinterpretation or unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the code, with no security concerns.",
