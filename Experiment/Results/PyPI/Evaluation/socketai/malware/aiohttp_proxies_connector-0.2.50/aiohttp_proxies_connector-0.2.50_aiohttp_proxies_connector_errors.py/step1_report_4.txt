{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only establishes exception class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, primarily inheriting from built-in exception classes. These serve as error indicators for SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy issues. There are no external data sources, no use of input/output functions, no network operations, and no suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, with clear inheritance structures and no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be a benign, standard error class hierarchy implementation.",
