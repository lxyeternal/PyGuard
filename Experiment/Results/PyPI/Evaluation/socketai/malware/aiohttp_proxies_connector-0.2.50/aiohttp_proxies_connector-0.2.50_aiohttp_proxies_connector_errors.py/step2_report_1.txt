  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or executable logic are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code contains only class definitions for exceptions, with no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No flaws are apparent; the reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely declarative.\n- The consistent scoring of zero for malware and obfuscation is appropriate.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky patterns are evident.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The only potential concern could be if these exception classes were misused in a malicious context, but the code itself does not support this.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
