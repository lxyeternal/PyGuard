  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself, as it is purely declarative.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The purpose of each report aligns with the code's intent: defining exception classes for error handling.\n\n**Logical flaws or reasoning errors:**\n- No logical flaws are evident; the reports correctly interpret the code.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Challenge assumptions:**\n- Since the code is straightforward class definitions, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior that need challenging.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments are necessary.",
