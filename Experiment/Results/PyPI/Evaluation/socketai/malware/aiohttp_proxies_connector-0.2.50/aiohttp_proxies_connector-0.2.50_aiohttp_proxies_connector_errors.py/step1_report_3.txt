  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and related connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input data reading or external data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows as no data handling or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. All classes inherit from standard exceptions and contain no executable code, data handling, or network operations. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or covert data leaks. The structure and content are typical for a module providing error classes, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard, benign pattern for defining custom exceptions.",
