  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions do not read data",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; exception classes are purely declarative",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are used for exception handling and control flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class declarations for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple custom exception classes, mostly inheriting from SocksError, with one inheriting from OSError. These classes are standard in Python to handle specific error cases related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy issues. There is no logic, data processing, or unusual behavior present. The code appears to serve as an error handling framework. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS/proxy operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be purely declarative and safe.",
