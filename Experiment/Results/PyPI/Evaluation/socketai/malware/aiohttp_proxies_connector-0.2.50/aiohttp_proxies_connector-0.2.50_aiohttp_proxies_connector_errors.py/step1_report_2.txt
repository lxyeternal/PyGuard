{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions without data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; purely class inheritance definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. There are no data inputs, network operations, or data processing occurring. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The classes are standard Python custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exception types, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears benign and purely functional.",
