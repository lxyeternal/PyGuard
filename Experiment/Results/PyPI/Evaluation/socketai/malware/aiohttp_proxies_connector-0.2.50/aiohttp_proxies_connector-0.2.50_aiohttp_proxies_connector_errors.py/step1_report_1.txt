{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code only defines exception classes without data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. These classes inherit from built-in exceptions such as Exception, OSError, and specific SOCKS error classes. There are no functions, data handling, network interactions, or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, code execution, or data leakage. The structure and content are standard for defining exception hierarchies and show no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for handling SOCKS proxy errors. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks present. The code appears benign and intended for structured error handling within a larger application.",
