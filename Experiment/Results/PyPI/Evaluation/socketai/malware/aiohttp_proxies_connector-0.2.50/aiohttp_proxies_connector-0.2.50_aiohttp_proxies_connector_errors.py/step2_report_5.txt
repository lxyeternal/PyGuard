  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as structured error handling mechanisms.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; it is straightforward class inheritance without any hidden or malicious logic.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely declarative.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, appropriate for such benign class definitions.\n- Confidence is 1 in all cases, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are apparent.\n- The purpose and analysis align well with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The code is benign; no risks or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
