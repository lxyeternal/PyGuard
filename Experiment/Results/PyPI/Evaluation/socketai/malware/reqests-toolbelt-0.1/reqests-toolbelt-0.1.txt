The high malware score (1), obfuscation score (0.9), and security risk score (1) are justified. It should be considered malicious and handled accordingly."

Other reports are benign, with low scores (0 or 0.2). The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. Continued monitoring for obfuscation and dynamic code execution is recommended."
