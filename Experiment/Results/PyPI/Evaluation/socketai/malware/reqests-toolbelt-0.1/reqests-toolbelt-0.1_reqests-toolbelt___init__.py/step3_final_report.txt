  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, standard input, files, network connections, subprocess calls, and dynamic code execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, subprocess invocations, dynamic code execution, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into code execution, network transmission, or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious URLs, complex control flow, hardcoded secrets, or unusual data handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose was identified based on input sources and data flows. Suspicious patterns like obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or network activity were flagged as anomalies. Benign code lacked such indicators. The suspicious code (Report 2) shows obfuscation (score 0.75), dynamic eval/exec usage, and network activity, justifying a malware score of 0.6 and security risk of 0.65. Benign reports show no such patterns, with scores at 0 or 0.2. The confidence scores reflect the certainty based on available data. Overall, the scoring aligns with observed behaviors and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious activity, warranting a higher malware score (0.6) and obfuscation score (0.75). Other reports are benign, with low scores (0 or 0.2). The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. Continued monitoring for obfuscation and dynamic code execution is recommended.",
