  "conclusion": "The code exhibits extensive obfuscation and performs actions typical of malicious malware, including system modifications, privilege checks, and covert package installations. The high malware score (1), obfuscation score (0.9), and security risk score (1) are justified. It should be considered malicious and handled accordingly."
