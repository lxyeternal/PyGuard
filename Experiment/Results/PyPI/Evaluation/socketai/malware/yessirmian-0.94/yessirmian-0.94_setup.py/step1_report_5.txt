  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation command that sends system information via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "webhook.send()",
  "flows": "System hostname and IP address collected via socket functions are sent through the Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which could be malicious if used improperly. No user input is involved, but the webhook transmits system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install command. During installation, it constructs a Discord webhook object using a hardcoded URL and sends system hostname and IP address info to that webhook. This occurs without user awareness or consent. The webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, indicating potential malicious intent such as unauthorized data exfiltration. The package dependencies include 'discord.py' and 'requests', which are standard but used here for sending system data stealthily. No other suspicious or malicious code components are present. The overall behavior suggests data leakage or privacy violation rather than malware, but the use of hardcoded webhooks is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior by sending system information to an external Discord webhook without user consent, indicating a privacy breach. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious. No malware such as damaging system files or unauthorized access is evident, but data exfiltration constitutes a security risk.",
