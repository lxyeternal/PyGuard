  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation process that sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "webhook.send(content=...)",
  "flows": "During installation, system hostname and IP address are sent to the specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL embedded in the code; usage of socket module to retrieve hostname and IP address for reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the installation process by overriding the run method of setuptools' install class. It initializes a Discord webhook using a hardcoded URL and sends the current system's hostname and IP address to it upon installation. The webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, which is suspicious as it indicates potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The use of socket module is standard for gathering system info, but combined with the webhook reporting, this indicates a privacy concern or malicious intent. No other malicious code, such as backdoors or data theft beyond the reported system info, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to send system information to a specific Discord webhook during installation, with the webhook URL hardcoded. This behavior could be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration of system info without user consent. The overall behavior suggests a malicious or privacy-invasive intent.",
