  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname and IP address during package installation by sending this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "webhook.send(content=...)",
  "flows": "hostname/IP retrieval -> webhook.send() during install",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, data exfiltration during setup, unnecessary inclusion of 'socket' in install_requires",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, retrieves system hostname and IP address using socket, then sends this information via a Discord webhook embedded directly in the code. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating deliberate data exfiltration. The use of discord.py and socket modules for this purpose is unusual in a setup script. The data transmission occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious and privacy-invasive. No obfuscation or destructive code is present, but the covert exfiltration constitutes malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system hostname and IP address during installation via a hardcoded webhook, representing a significant security and privacy risk. The behavior is malicious, and the high scores reflect this. The code should be flagged for security review or removal.",
