{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, specifically to send system information via a Discord webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), Webhook.from_url()",
  "sinks": "webhook.send()",
  "flows": "system information (hostname and IP) is gathered and sent directly to a Discord webhook URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL in the code, which transmits system information to an external service upon package installation; inclusion of 'socket' in install_requires, which is a standard library and unnecessary here",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when executed, sends the system's hostname and IP address to a specific Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which is suspicious as it indicates data exfiltration. The webhook is used to transmit system info, which could be malicious if intended for malicious monitoring or data theft. The 'socket' module is listed as a requirement, but it is a standard library and does not need to be installed separately. The overall purpose appears to be covertly reporting system details during package installation, which is a malicious behavior. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as code execution, data theft beyond system info, or persistence mechanisms, but the data exfiltration via webhook during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information via a hardcoded Discord webhook during package installation. This indicates potential malicious intent related to spying or data theft. The overall security risk is high due to this covert data transmission.",
