{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, sends system hostname and IP address information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname and IP address using socket library; potentially relies on user input or environment during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook URL, which can potentially leak system info to an external service.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname and IP, then transmits this data via webhook during installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of a webhook URL in the code, automatically sending system info during install, which can be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers the system's hostname and IP address using socket functions. It then sends this information to a specified Discord webhook, potentially without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and this behavior occurs during package installation. This could be used for malicious surveillance or unauthorized data collection. The rest of the setup script is standard, with no other suspicious behaviors detected. The inclusion of network communication in the install process is unusual and potentially malicious if used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a malicious behavior where it exfiltrates system information during installation via a webhook. This indicates an intent to monitor or spy on users without their knowledge. The code's core malicious aspect is the automatic data transmission during package installation.",
