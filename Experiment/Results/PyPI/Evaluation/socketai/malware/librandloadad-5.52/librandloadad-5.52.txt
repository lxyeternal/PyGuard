      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup, with embedded malicious indicators such as URL and silent error handling. These factors strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially leading to remote code execution or data exfiltration. The package should be considered malicious or compromised pending decoding and analysis of the payload."
