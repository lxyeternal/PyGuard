      "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload in a stealthy manner. The presence of suspicious URL, silent execution, and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score to 1, and the security risk score to 1, reflecting the high severity and potential for harm."
