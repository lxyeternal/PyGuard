      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, system API calls, privilege checks, and dynamic code execution. It is designed to conceal its true purpose and can perform harmful actions such as system modifications, privilege escalation, and backdoor setup. The malware score is set to 0.9, the obfuscation score to 1, and the security risk to 0.95, reflecting a high-confidence assessment of malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows high obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns consistent with malicious activity. While explicit payloads are not confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.7). The obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the significant code complexity and concealment techniques. It is recommended to perform dynamic analysis and deobfuscation to confirm malicious intent before use. The overall assessment indicates a high potential threat requiring cautious handling."
