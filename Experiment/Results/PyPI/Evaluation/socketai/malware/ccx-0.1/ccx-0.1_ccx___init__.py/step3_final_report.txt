  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious external references, and potential security risks.",
  "sources": "Network operations, environment variables, hardcoded URLs/credentials, dynamic eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file I/O, subprocess calls, dynamic code execution points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as external URLs or environment variables feed into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious payload execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec on external input, suspicious URLs, hardcoded credentials, complex control flow, minimal comments, obfuscated import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, with patterns typical of malicious scripts. Several reports highlight suspicious external references, environment variable usage, and obfuscated variable names. While some reports note benign or incomplete code, others identify high suspicion of malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code, and suspicious URLs strongly suggest potential remote code execution or data exfiltration. The scores assigned across reports are consistent with observed patterns, with higher scores in reports emphasizing obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Static analysis indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, especially in reports 2 and 5, which describe heavily obfuscated code with external references and eval/exec. Overall, the code warrants further dynamic analysis and deobfuscation before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows high obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns consistent with malicious activity. While explicit payloads are not confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.7). The obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the significant code complexity and concealment techniques. It is recommended to perform dynamic analysis and deobfuscation to confirm malicious intent before use. The overall assessment indicates a high potential threat requiring cautious handling.",
