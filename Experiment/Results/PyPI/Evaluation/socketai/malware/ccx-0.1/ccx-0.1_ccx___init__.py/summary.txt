  "conclusion": "The dependency shows high obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns consistent with malicious activity. While explicit payloads are not confirmed, the suspicious patterns justify a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.7). The obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the significant code complexity and concealment techniques. It is recommended to perform dynamic analysis and deobfuscation to confirm malicious intent before use. The overall assessment indicates a high potential threat requiring cautious handling."
