  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() usage, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation patterns, network operations, environment variable access, dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input handling, code execution points, network communication, data exfiltration, environment variable leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., eval(), network calls), potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious obfuscation, use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded IPs or secrets, dynamic imports, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively suggest that Report 1 indicates high suspicion with signs of malicious code, including obfuscation and dynamic execution, justified by high malware (0.65) and risk (0.7) scores. Reports 2 and 3 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, reflected in low scores (malware 0, risk 0.2). Report 4 notes potential risks like eval() usage and network operations, assigning moderate scores (malware 0.3, risk 0.55), which are justified given the patterns but lack confirmed malicious payloads. Report 5 lacks code for analysis, appropriately scored zero. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, with the most suspicious report (1) justifiably having higher scores. Based on the evidence, the overall malware score is estimated at approximately 0.4, obfuscation at 0.3, and overall risk at 0.45, balancing the suspicion and benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports' scores are generally consistent with their analyses. Report 1 indicates potential malicious activity justified by suspicious patterns, while Reports 2 and 3 are benign. Report 4 shows potential risks but no confirmed malicious payloads. The scores align with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary given the summaries. Actual code review could refine these estimates further.",
