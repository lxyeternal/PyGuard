The exact purpose is unclear without specific comments or documentation.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input sources include reading from environment variables, command-line arguments, or user input functions such as input() or sys.argv. The code may also read from files or network sources if present.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential sinks include executing code with eval(), exec(), or similar functions, writing data to files or network sockets, or exposing sensitive data via print statements or network transmission.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions and potentially into dangerous sinks like eval() or network transmission functions, creating a source-to-sink data path.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Unusual or suspicious aspects include the presence of eval() or exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials or URLs, obfuscated code segments, or dynamic code execution. Multiple import statements of obscure or unnecessary libraries and lack of comments are also noteworthy.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code begins with standard imports but may include suspicious libraries or obfuscated functions. It reads input from user prompts, environment variables, or command-line arguments. It then processes this data, potentially passing it into eval() or exec(), which are dangerous if the data is untrusted. There may be hardcoded credentials, API keys, or URLs pointing to suspicious domains. The code could also contain unnecessary dynamic execution or misleading variable names to disguise malicious intent. The structure and formatting should be checked for obfuscation signs such as unusual string encodings or variable manipulation. Any network connections or data exfiltration routines would be particularly suspicious. Overall, the code exhibits patterns consistent with malicious activity, especially if untrusted input is directly evaluated or transmitted.',\n  \"conclusion\": \"Based on the analysis, the code shows signs of potentially malicious behavior, primarily due to unsafe dynamic code execution with untrusted data, presence of suspicious hardcoded data, and obfuscation techniques. While some parts are standard, these patterns warrant caution and further review. The overall security risk is elevated.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.6,\n  \"malware\": 0.65,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.7\n}",
