{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP request with encoded system info over an SSL socket to a remote server (d4d.one).",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes info -> constructs HTTP GET request -> establishes SSL connection -> transmits data.",
  "anomalies": "Code silently ignores exceptions, making detection of failures difficult. The hostname used as a fixed target domain ('d4d.one') could be malicious or suspicious. Data is encoded and transmitted automatically during installation, which is unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script, during installation, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It encodes this info and sends it via an SSL socket to a specific domain. This operation occurs transparently without user consent, indicating potential privacy violations. No user input validation or explicit user notice is present. The silent exception handling prevents detection of failures. The purpose seems to be data exfiltration or tracking, not typical setup behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious activity by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during package installation without user awareness. While it does not contain obvious malicious payloads like damaging files or reverse shells, the data exfiltration aspect is concerning and indicates malicious or tracking intent.",
