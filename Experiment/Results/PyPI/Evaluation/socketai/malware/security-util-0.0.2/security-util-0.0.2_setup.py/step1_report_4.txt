  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that includes a custom installation step which collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "s_sock.send() over a network socket to a remote server (d4d.one)",
  "flows": "Collect system info (hostname, cwd, username) -> encode in base64 -> embed in HTTP request -> send over SSL socket to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Embedded IP address and hostname transmission during installation without user consent; network activity during package installation; use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors; no user notifications or logs; sending data to a suspicious domain 'd4d.one'",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon package installation, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It encodes this data and sends it via an SSL-encrypted socket to a specific external domain. The use of silent exception handling and the immediate network transmission during installation suggest malicious intent. The code does not inform the user or obtain explicit consent. The target domain appears suspicious. There are no other potentially malicious or obfuscated elements, but the behavior indicates covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data collection and transmission during package installation, which constitutes malicious behavior. It likely aims to exfiltrate system info stealthily. The overall security risk is high due to this covert data exfiltration and external communication.",
