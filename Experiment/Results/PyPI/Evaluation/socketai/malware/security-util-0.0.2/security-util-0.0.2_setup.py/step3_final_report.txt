{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and covertly transmits this data to a remote server (d4d.one) over an SSL connection, without user consent or notification.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "sockets to d4d.one on port 443, sending an HTTP GET request with encoded data",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> JSON encoding -> base64 encoding -> embedded in HTTP GET request -> SSL socket connection -> data transmission to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Network activity during installation, silent exception handling, no user notification, hardcoded target domain, data sent over SSL without explicit certificate verification, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by collecting system info and transmitting it during package setup, with broad exception handling that suppresses errors. The SSL connection is established to a suspicious domain, and the data is embedded in an HTTP GET request. The code is simple, transparent, and lacks obfuscation. The activity is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious behavior, primarily privacy violation through covert data collection. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8-0.9, security risk 0.8-0.9) are justified; however, given the clear malicious intent, a maximum malware score of 1.0 and risk score of 1.0 would be appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during installation without user consent. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the activity is highly suspicious and potentially damaging. The high scores in malware and security risk are justified; I recommend setting malware and risk scores to 1.0 to reflect the severity.",
