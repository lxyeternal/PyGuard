{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() — data collection during install",
  "sinks": "socket connection to 'd4d.one' over SSL, sending an HTTP GET request with encoded payload",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, current working directory, and username is encoded in base64, embedded in an HTTP request, and sent over a secure socket connection to the target server",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network communication during package installation, which is unusual; use of broad exception handling suppresses errors; no validation or encryption of data beyond base64 encoding; presence of hardcoded target domain",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via a SSL-secured socket to a specified domain. The data transmission occurs without user consent, logging, or transparency. The broad except block suppresses all errors, potentially hiding malicious activity or errors. The communication pattern resembles data exfiltration or fingerprinting rather than legitimate setup procedures. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but facilitates silent data collection and transmission during package installation, which could be malicious or violate user privacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a covert data exfiltration mechanism embedded within a package's setup process. It collects sensitive system information and transmits it to a remote server without explicit user consent, indicating malicious intent. The overall behavior suggests potential privacy violations or malicious monitoring, classifying it as likely malicious with high security risk.",
