  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during installation without user consent. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the activity is highly suspicious and potentially damaging. The high scores in malware and security risk are justified; I recommend setting malware and risk scores to 1.0 to reflect the severity."
