{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes a custom installation class that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and sends an HTTP GET request over a SSL socket to a remote server with the collected data encoded in base64.",
  "flows": "The source data (hostname, cwd, username) is encoded in base64 and sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote domain (d4d.one) over SSL, potentially exfiltrating system information.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently catches all exceptions during network communication, hiding potential errors. The network request to a suspicious domain during package installation is unusual. No comments or documentation explain this behavior, which is suspicious. The code does not verify the server's certificate, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, although it does set up SSL context with TLSv1_2.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries to gather system info: hostname, current directory, and username. It encodes this data into JSON, then base64, and sends it as part of an HTTP GET request to a domain 'd4d.one'. The request is sent over a TLS socket without verifying the server's certificate, which is insecure. The network activity occurs during package installation, which is uncommon and suspicious. Exception handling is broad and silent, preventing detection of network failures. This behavior indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious tracking during installation. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating user and system information to a remote server during package installation. The use of network requests with encoded data during setup is suspicious, especially without clear documentation or user consent. This indicates a likely malicious behavior aimed at tracking or data theft.",
