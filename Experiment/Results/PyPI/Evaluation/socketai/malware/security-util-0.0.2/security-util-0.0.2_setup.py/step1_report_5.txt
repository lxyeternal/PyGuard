{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package, which collects system information and attempts to send it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The collected data is encoded and sent via a network socket connection to a specified external server (d4d.one) over SSL/TLS.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources, encoded in base64, embedded into an HTTP request string, and sent over a network socket to the remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during the install process without user consent, using hardcoded target domain and silent try-except block that suppresses errors. The network activity is hidden within the install routine, which is unusual. No user notification or configuration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a custom 'install' class that overrides the run method to execute additional code during package installation. It collects system info (hostname, current directory, username) and encodes this info in base64 within an HTTP GET request. The request is sent over a secure socket to a hardcoded external server (d4d.one). The network connection is established silently, and errors are suppressed with a broad except block, which could hide failures. This behavior suggests an attempt to covertly transmit user system data to an external entity, indicating malicious intent. There is no indication of legitimate functionality or user notification. The code does not contain obfuscation or other techniques to hide its purpose, but its behavior is highly suspicious given the context.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes code that covertly collects and transmits system information to a remote server during installation, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The silent network communication and data exfiltration during setup constitute a security risk.",
