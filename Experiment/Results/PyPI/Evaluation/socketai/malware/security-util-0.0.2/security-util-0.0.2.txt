      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during installation without user consent. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the activity is highly suspicious and potentially damaging. The high scores in malware and security risk are justified; I recommend setting malware and risk scores to 1.0 to reflect the severity."

      "conclusion": "The provided reports' scores are generally consistent with their analyses. Report 1 indicates potential malicious activity justified by suspicious patterns, while Reports 2 and 3 are benign. Report 4 shows potential risks but no confirmed malicious payloads. The scores align with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary given the summaries. Actual code review could refine these estimates further."
