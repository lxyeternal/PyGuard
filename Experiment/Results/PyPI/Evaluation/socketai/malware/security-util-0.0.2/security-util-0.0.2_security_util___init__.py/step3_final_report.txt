  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code is purely a comment with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment disclaimer with no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. All review reports correctly identify that the code is benign, containing only a comment. No sources, sinks, flows, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned across reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), as the analysis is straightforward and unambiguous. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment disclaimer with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The existing reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
