{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data from browsers, Discord, Telegram, wallets, and other applications. It collects tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and system information, then uploads this data to remote servers.",
  "sources": "Reads user data from browser storage, system files, Discord, Telegram directories, and local SQLite databases for passwords and cookies, as well as environment variables for paths and tokens.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data via HTTP POST requests to remote Telegram and anonymous file hosting servers, including sensitive tokens, passwords, cookies, and files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser/local storage and system files into in-memory variables (tokens, passwords, cookies). These are then formatted and sent to external servers via HTTP POST requests, often after being decrypted or extracted. The code also downloads and installs packages, and kills processes for certain applications during operation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, hardcoded list of keywords related to passwords and accounts, repeated process-killing commands, dynamic code execution attempts (via subprocess), and automated installation of dependencies. Use of functions like 'ZipThings' and 'GatherZips' to archive files suggest data exfiltration. The code extensively kills processes and manipulates files without user consent, indicative of malicious intent. Also, the code attempts to bypass security via environment variables and dynamic package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive stealer targeting multiple applications and data sources. It includes functions to decrypt stored passwords and cookies, gather tokens from browser and Discord files, and extract files based on keyword matching. It exfiltrates data via HTTP requests to Telegram and anonymous hosting services. Hardcoded credentials (Telegram token and chat ID), process-killing commands, and the absence of user prompts suggest malicious intent. The code also installs dependencies automatically, which could be used to hide or facilitate malicious activity. The use of threading, file archiving, and dynamic process management indicates an advanced, persistent data theft tool.",
  "conclusion": "This source code functions as a malicious information stealer, designed to extract sensitive user data, including browser credentials, Discord tokens, wallet files, and system info, then exfiltrate it covertly. The presence of hardcoded secrets, aggressive process management, and comprehensive data collection points to high malicious intent and security risk.",
