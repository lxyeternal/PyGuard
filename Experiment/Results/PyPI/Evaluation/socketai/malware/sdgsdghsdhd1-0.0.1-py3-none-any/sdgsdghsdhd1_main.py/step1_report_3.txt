{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious payload (possibly part of a stealer or malware) designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from the victim's system. It also attempts to gather browser data, extract wallet information, and upload collected data to external servers.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser storage files (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord local files, Telegram data, and local system files (e.g., login data, cookies, extensions). It also reads environment variables for paths and local state files for decryption keys.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (Gofile, anonfiles, Telegram API). Executes system commands to kill processes and create ZIP archives of files for exfiltration. Writes data to temporary files and deletes them after upload.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, passwords, cookies from local browser and application files → decrypts sensitive data using system APIs and custom functions → compiles data into formatted messages or files → uploads data to external servers via HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID for sending messages, potentially indicating command-and-control communication. Contains code to install missing Python modules automatically. Executes system commands to kill processes, which is suspicious. Uses threading to perform parallel data collection. Loads and decrypts sensitive data from local files in a way consistent with credential theft malware. The code structure is complex, and it employs techniques typical of malware to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including collecting sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser history, and wallet information. It decrypts stored data by leveraging Windows API functions and decrypts encrypted browser data. It performs process termination commands to kill related applications before ZIP archiving files for exfiltration. The hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID imply remote command and control capabilities. The code’s modular design with threading and functions for file collection, compression, and upload suggests an intent to maximize data exfiltration efficiency while avoiding detection. Its use of system APIs, decryption techniques, and external data uploading strongly points toward malicious intent, with no legitimate purpose apparent. The code avoids obfuscation but employs complex structures to facilitate stealth and efficiency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential and data stealer designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data from various applications and browser stores. It employs techniques consistent with malware, such as process termination, decryption of stored data, and external server communication for data exfiltration. Its use of hardcoded credentials for Telegram and the process-killing commands further confirms malicious intent. The overall security risk is high.",
