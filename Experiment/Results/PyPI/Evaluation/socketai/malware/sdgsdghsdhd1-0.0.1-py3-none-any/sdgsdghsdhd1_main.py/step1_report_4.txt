{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user information, including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal data, then exfiltrating it via Telegram and file upload services. It also includes functionality for zip archiving and uploading files, as well as searching user directories for specific keywords.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include reading files from browser and application directories (e.g., logs, login data, cookies, local state), regex matching for tokens in logs, environment variables for paths, and network requests to fetch IP and send data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests (e.g., Telegram webhook, file upload to anonfiles/gofile), file system operations (writing logs, zipping files), and subprocess commands (killing processes). Sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and user data is exfiltrated without user consent.",
  "flows": "Sources such as reading local files and regex matching feed into data extraction functions, which process and decrypt tokens, passwords, cookies, and other data. These are then passed to functions that upload data to remote servers (via requests or anonfiles). Network request responses are used to confirm successful exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which is suspicious. The code forcibly kills processes like browsers and Steam to access files. It installs missing Python modules silently via subprocess. It performs extensive directory searching and file zipping for exfiltration. Use of obfuscated regex and dynamic process termination indicate malicious intent. The presence of functions that gather passwords, cookies, and tokens suggests malicious data theft.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to gather user data from multiple browsers and applications, decrypt stored credentials, and identify sensitive tokens (including Discord). It uses threading for concurrent operations, indicating an attempt to maximize data collection speed. It installs necessary libraries if missing, then extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and account info. It performs file searches based on specific keywords and archives found files. Data is exfiltrated via Telegram and anonfiles URLs, with hardcoded credentials and process termination commands suggesting malicious sabotage. The code includes functions for ZIP archiving and uploading, further indicating data exfiltration intentions. The hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID are typical indicators of malicious remote control or data collection.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits multiple signs of malicious behavior typical of info-stealing malware: it collects and decrypts sensitive user data from browsers and applications, terminates processes to access files, and exfiltrates data via external services. The presence of hardcoded credentials, process killing, and extensive data gathering confirms malicious intent. Overall, it is a highly suspicious and dangerous piece of code designed to compromise user privacy and security.",
