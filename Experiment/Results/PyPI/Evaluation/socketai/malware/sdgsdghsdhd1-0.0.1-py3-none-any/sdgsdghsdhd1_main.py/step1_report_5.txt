{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a malicious payload for data theft, specifically targeting user credentials, tokens, cookies, and sensitive files from browsers, applications, and system directories. It exfiltrates gathered data via Telegram and anonfiles.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading files from browser directories, application data folders, system directories, and network responses. It extracts tokens from logs, cookies from browser databases, and credentials from various app data.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests to Telegram bot API and anonfiles uploads. Data is sent as formatted messages or uploaded files, which are then shared through the Telegram hook or anonfiles links.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, databases, network responses) are parsed and processed, decrypted where applicable, and then passed to functions that send or upload the data to external servers via HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID indicates malicious intent. The code actively installs dependencies without user consent, scans multiple browser and app directories for sensitive data, and uses threading for concurrent operations. Presence of functions targeting browser cookies, saved passwords, tokens, and files. The code also kills processes and zips files for exfiltration. No legitimate functionality or user benefit is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive reconnaissance by extracting tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and applications (Discord, Steam, Exodus, NKBihf browser extension). It decrypts data using Windows Data Protection API and AES-GCM, indicating knowledge of system security features. It gathers and zips data, then uploads the files to external hosting services while also sending summaries via Telegram. It installs dependencies like requests and pycryptodome silently, suggesting persistence of malicious modules. The script's structure and naming conventions, along with functions like 'GatherZips', 'ZipThings', 'uploadToken', and 'GatherAll', confirm its intent for data theft and exfiltration. The use of threading enhances stealth and efficiency. Overall, the code is a typical stealer with significant malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting browser data, tokens, cookies, and files, with automated uploading and exfiltration via Telegram and anonfiles. It employs encryption, process termination, and threading to maximize data theft while evading detection. The hardcoded Telegram token and active data collection confirm malicious intent.",
