  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic execution, obfuscated variable names, and input handling.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., eval, exec, environment variables) to sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, inconsistent formatting, hidden behaviors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are red flags for malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions like data exfiltration or damaging system files are confirmed. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. The code's benign appearance in some reports suggests the need for further static/dynamic analysis to confirm malicious behavior. The overall risk is moderate due to obfuscation but lacks concrete malicious activity evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but not definitive malicious activity. The malware score is set at 0.6, reflecting moderate suspicion, and the obfuscation score at 0.7. The security risk is adjusted to 0.65 to account for potential hidden threats. Further detailed analysis is recommended to confirm or refute malicious intent.",
