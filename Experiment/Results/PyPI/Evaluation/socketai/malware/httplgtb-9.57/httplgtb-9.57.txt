      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to embedded obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during setup. The techniques used are characteristic of malware, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. Immediate further analysis, including decoding the payload, is recommended before deployment."
