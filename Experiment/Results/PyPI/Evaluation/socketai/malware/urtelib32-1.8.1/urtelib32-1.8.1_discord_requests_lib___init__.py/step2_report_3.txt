  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements a proxy management class with embedded credentials.\n- Handles rate limiting via JSON response parsing.\n- Switches proxies upon detecting \"blocked from accessing\" messages.\n- Performs HTTP requests with various methods.\n- Minimal error handling (print statements).\n- No obfuscation or malicious code evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility for web scraping/API with proxy rotation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent, just standard request handling. Mentions potential exposure of sensitive data due to proxy credentials.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. No malicious activity detected. The minor security concern about embedding credentials is acknowledged but not malicious.  \n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware remains 0. **(appropriate)**  \n- Security risk at 0.2 is reasonable given the credential handling.  \n- Confidence at 0.9 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy management with rate limiting and proxy switching.\n- **Findings:** No malicious payloads, but the code could be misused for malicious purposes such as evading restrictions or automating abuse.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.3.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes that the code itself isn't malicious but could be exploited. The logic of proxy rotation based on response messages is standard for such utilities.  \n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware remains 0, consistent with the code.  \n- Security risk at 0.3 is acceptable, considering potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy rotation with handling of rate limits and blocked responses.\n- **Findings:** No malicious payloads, but embedding credentials could be privacy-sensitive. Proxy rotation could mask malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No malicious code detected. The potential for misuse is acknowledged but not inherent in the code.  \n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware remains 0.  \n- Security risk at 0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy management with rate limiting and switching.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Handles credentials carefully but could leak if logs are mishandled.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.3.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No malicious intent. The main concern is proper handling of credentials.  \n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware remains 0.  \n- Security risk at 0.3 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy handling with rate limiting and switching.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity. No obfuscation or backdoors. Properly handles credentials.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is a legitimate utility.  \n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware remains 0.  \n- Security risk at 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.3), mainly due to handling credentials and potential misuse.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** Considering the embedded credentials and potential for misuse, I would assign a **0.2** to **0.3** range. Given the current reports, I lean toward **0.2** as the overall risk, since the code is primarily a utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard proxy rotation utility with rate limiting features. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the handling of proxy credentials, which should be secured properly in deployment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.2**",
