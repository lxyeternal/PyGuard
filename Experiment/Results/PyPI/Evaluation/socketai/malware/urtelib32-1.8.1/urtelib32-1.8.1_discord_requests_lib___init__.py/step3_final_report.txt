  "purpose": "A utility class for managing HTTP requests via proxies with embedded credentials, rate limiting, and proxy rotation upon detection of access blocks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxies, response JSON parsing for rate limits and block messages.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL construction with embedded credentials, response handling that triggers proxy change.",
  "flows": "Proxy list initialization -> request execution -> response JSON parsing -> detection of block or rate limit -> proxy switch if needed.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding credentials directly into proxy URLs; minimal error handling with print statements; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs proxies with embedded username and password, manages rate limits by parsing JSON responses, and switches proxies when a 'blocked' message is detected. It supports multiple HTTP methods with straightforward request execution. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The primary security concern is exposure of credentials if logs are mishandled, but this is a common practice in proxy management. The code's behavior aligns with standard proxy rotation utilities used in scraping or automation, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard proxy request handler with rate limiting and proxy rotation features. It does not contain malware or malicious payloads. The main security consideration is the handling of embedded credentials, which should be secured but does not indicate malicious activity. The existing reports correctly assess the code as non-malicious, with low to moderate security risk primarily due to credential handling. I concur with the provided scores and assessments.",
