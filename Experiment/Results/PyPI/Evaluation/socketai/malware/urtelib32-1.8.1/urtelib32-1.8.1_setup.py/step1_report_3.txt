{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that elevates privileges, downloads an image file from a remote server, executes its contents, and then proceeds with standard package installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to remote URL for image.png; reading the file image.png; sys.argv during privilege elevation",
  "sinks": "exec(b64decode(open('image.png', 'rb').read())) - executes decoded content from the downloaded file",
  "flows": "Remote HTTP response -> saved to 'image.png' -> read from 'image.png' -> decoded and executed",
  "anomalies": "Download of executable code disguised as an image file; use of exec to run decoded content; privilege escalation loop; no validation of downloaded content",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that elevates privileges on Windows by looping until admin rights are obtained. It then downloads a file from a specified URL, saving it as 'image.png'. Instead of handling image data, the code immediately executes the contents of this file after decoding it from base64. The downloaded file is presumed to contain executable code, which is a significant security concern. After execution, it waits 15 seconds before proceeding with the regular installation process. The code's structure and the use of exec on remote data indicate malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, persistence, or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains clear malicious behavior: privilege escalation, downloading and executing remote code without validation, and obfuscation via base64. It poses a high security risk and is likely malicious.",
