{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'urtelib32' with specific dependencies and a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL to download an image file, reads local files (image.png), and accesses system functions via ctypes.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded base64 data from the downloaded image, and elevation to administrator privileges via shell32 functions.",
  "flows": "Code fetches content from a remote URL, saves it as 'image.png', then decodes and executes it, potentially running malicious code. The elevation check is used to gain admin rights before executing further actions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes forcing admin privileges, downloading and executing code from an external server, and using 'exec' on decoded data, which is highly suspicious. The repeated sleep and recursive install call could be obfuscation or malicious persistence behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method to perform several suspicious actions. It elevates to admin rights without user consent, downloads a file from a specified URL, writes it as 'image.png', and then executes its decoded content. This pattern is indicative of malicious payload delivery. The use of 'exec' on external content is dangerous, potentially allowing remote code execution. The code is designed to run during package installation, potentially hiding malicious activities under legitimate setup routines. The inclusion of system privilege escalation and remote code execution points to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior aimed at executing remote code with elevated privileges. It downloads a potentially harmful script from an external source, executes it locally, and runs as part of the package installation. These actions strongly suggest malware activity intended for system compromise.",
