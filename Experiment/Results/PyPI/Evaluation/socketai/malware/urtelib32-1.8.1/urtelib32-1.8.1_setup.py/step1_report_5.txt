  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to elevate privileges, download, decode, and execute a remote image file, then delay and continue installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the installation script, requests.get() for remote content, reading 'image.png' from disk.",
  "sinks": "exec() on decoded content from 'image.png', potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "During run(), check admin rights -> download 'image.png' from remote server -> decode and execute content -> sleep -> continue installation.",
  "anomalies": "Elevating to admin privileges unconditionally, downloading and executing remote code via 'exec' on base64-decoded data, hardcoded URL and headers, no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to request admin privileges using ctypes, which can be suspicious. It downloads a file from a hardcoded URL, writes it as 'image.png', and executes its decoded content. The use of exec() on external content is highly risky, indicating potential malicious behavior. The delay with sleep appears unnecessary and could be used to obfuscate or delay detection. No obfuscation in code structure, but the behavior is dangerous due to remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs privilege escalation, downloads a remote payload, and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and it should be considered malicious behavior. The malware score is 1, security risk is 0.9, with high confidence.",
