  "purpose": "Fetch and execute code from a remote server, potentially for dynamic behavior control.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/' with custom headers.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code retrieved from the network response.",
  "flows": "Request data from remote server -> receive JSON -> extract 'code' -> execute code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on remote content is highly suspicious; hardcoded URL and header values; unusual header key 'auth' with a non-standard value; the URL and context suggest possible data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script makes a network request to a potentially malicious domain, retrieves a code snippet in JSON format, and executes it directly without validation. The use of exec() on fetched code is a major security risk, allowing remote command execution. The headers and URL pattern suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity or bypass security controls. Overall, the pattern indicates an intentional malicious behavior or backdoor setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively fetches and executes remote code, which is a classic indicator of malicious intent. It can be used for remote command execution, data theft, or establishing a backdoor. High suspicion of malicious behavior due to direct code execution from network source.",
