  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command in a silent manner, combined with suspicious package naming and infrastructure comments. The high scores are justified by these indicators, and further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended for confirmation."
