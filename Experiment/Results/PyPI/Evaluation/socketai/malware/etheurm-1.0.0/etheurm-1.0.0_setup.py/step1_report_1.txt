{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'etheurm', with a custom installation class that executes potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, package metadata, and the import of modules such as os, requests, and fernet.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), dynamic import of requests and fernet modules, and potential network requests or code execution within the run() method.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code checks for Windows OS, then decrypts and executes embedded code using Fernet, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted code that is decrypted and executed at runtime, and inclusion of suspicious modules like requests and fernet solely for malicious activity. The long description and version info appear nonsensical or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes an obfuscated class with an intentionally complex name, which during installation decrypts and executes encrypted code using Fernet. This encrypted payload could contain malicious instructions such as system commands, network activity, or backdoors. The import of requests and fernet, combined with runtime execution of decrypted code, strongly suggests malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate setup-related activities with this payload; instead, it appears designed to hide malicious actions during install. The package metadata appears superficial or intentionally obfuscated, further raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains deliberately obfuscated code that decrypts and executes potentially malicious code during installation, likely to perform malicious actions or establish backdoors. The structure and behavior are characteristic of supply chain attacks aiming to compromise systems during package installation.",
