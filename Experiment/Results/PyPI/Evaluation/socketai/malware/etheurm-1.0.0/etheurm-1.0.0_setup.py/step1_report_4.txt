{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'etheurm', which includes custom installation behavior that conditionally executes code on Windows.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports modules ('requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code via 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decrypted content is malicious, especially since it is executed unconditionally on Windows.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) -> importing 'requests' and 'Fernet' -> decrypting data with 'Fernet' -> executing decrypted code with 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' with decrypted code is highly suspicious. The decryption key is embedded directly in the source code ('b'--9G3bILo1ra6Ba_S06NXomRrbBtyyWlMxP4TqOIE20='), which indicates potential malicious intent. The code conditionally executes on Windows only, which could be an attempt to target specific systems.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, during installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography' (though 'Fernet' is imported from 'fernet', which may be an alias or a placeholder). It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This pattern is typical of malicious code attempting to run hidden payloads at install time. The use of 'exec' on decrypted code introduces a high security risk, especially since no validation or sandboxing is performed. The code does not seem to perform any legitimate setup functions related to the package, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: it decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems. The presence of a hardcoded decryption key and use of 'exec' to run potentially malicious code indicates high malicious intent and security risk. This code should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
