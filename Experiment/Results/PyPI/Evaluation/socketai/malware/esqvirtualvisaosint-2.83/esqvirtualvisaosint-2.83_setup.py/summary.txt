  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The behavior suggests malicious activity, such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The embedded URL and obfuscation techniques reinforce this assessment. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as malicious until further verified."
