  "conclusion": "The script contains a high likelihood of malicious activity through obfuscated PowerShell execution during package installation. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Decoding the payload is recommended for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating the package as malicious."
