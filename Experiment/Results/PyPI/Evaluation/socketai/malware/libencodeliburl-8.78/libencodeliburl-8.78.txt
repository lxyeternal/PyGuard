      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious indicators, including obfuscated PowerShell execution, suspicious URL, and stealthy execution tactics. The setup function appears legitimate but is likely used as a cover. The scores assigned are appropriate; the package should be treated as malicious or compromised. Further analysis of the encoded command is recommended before deployment."
