  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading points, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets or URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via eval/exec or other dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials or URLs, unusual control flow, lack of comments, excessive complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation in several reports, with some indicating dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets, which are red flags. Reports 1 and 2 show no malicious indicators but note potential for dynamic behavior; their low malware scores are justified. Report 3 demonstrates obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, and hardcoded data, justifying higher suspicion scores. Reports 4 and 5 show obfuscation but no clear malicious activity, with scores reflecting cautious suspicion. Overall, the code appears to be obfuscated with some signs of potential malicious intent, primarily in report 3. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall threat level is moderate, warranting further static or dynamic analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and potential for malicious behavior, especially in report 3. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution points to a moderate security risk. Further investigation is recommended before deployment.",
