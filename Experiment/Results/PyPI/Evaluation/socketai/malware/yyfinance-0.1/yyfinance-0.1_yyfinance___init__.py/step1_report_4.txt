  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system operation, but the specific intent is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not explicitly read from files, network, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that may execute system commands, write to files, or send data over the network, but none are clearly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly performs variable assignments and function calls without external input/output handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable names are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain any apparent malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs with no signs of malicious intent. There are no indicators of code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations. No external data sources, such as network calls or file reads, are evident. The code’s structure and content do not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Without additional context or external dependencies that could be malicious, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code seems to perform its intended functionality without any malicious modifications or hidden backdoors.",
