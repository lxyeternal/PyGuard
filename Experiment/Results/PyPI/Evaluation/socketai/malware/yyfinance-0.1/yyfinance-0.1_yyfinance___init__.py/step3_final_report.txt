  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as environment variables, user inputs, external modules, or network/file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or other untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or effects), possibly indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code. For empty code samples, confidence scores are high but should be moderated to reflect uncertainty. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently low or zero, aligning with the analysis. The security risk scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments for limited context. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and consistent with the provided code snippets. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is found. The scoring is appropriate; only confidence scores for empty code samples should be slightly moderated. Final malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, with low security risk scores reflecting the lack of suspicious activity.",
