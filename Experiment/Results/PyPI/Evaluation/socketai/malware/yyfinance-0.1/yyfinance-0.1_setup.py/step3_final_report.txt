{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'yyfinance' package, but it is heavily obfuscated with complex string manipulations, large numeric calculations, and dynamic attribute access. It performs system modifications such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, manipulating files, and executing system commands, which are suspicious behaviors embedded within an obfuscated structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from command-line arguments (sys.argv), environment variables (os.getenv), and filesystem paths (os.path, os.walk). It also dynamically constructs strings for commands and paths using complex calculations and string operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to pip.main() for package installation, creating shortcuts via win32com.client.Dispatch, executing system commands with os.system(), manipulating files and directories, and interacting with environment variables and system APIs (ctypes).",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line arguments and environment variables into conditional logic that triggers package installation, shortcut creation, file operations, and system API calls. These actions are often obscured by dynamically generated strings and complex calculations, making the control flow intentionally difficult to analyze.",
  "anomalies": "The code features heavy obfuscation through complex bitwise and arithmetic operations, meaningless large calculations, dynamic string assembly, and nested conditional logic based on obscure constants. Variable names are in Asian characters, and the code performs system modifications under the guise of a setup script, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a heavily obfuscated setup file that, despite its superficial purpose, contains multiple indicators of malicious activity. It dynamically constructs commands and paths, installs packages, creates shortcuts, manipulates files, and interacts with system APIs—all hidden behind complex calculations and string manipulations designed to evade static detection. The presence of privilege escalation checks and system modifications suggests intent to compromise or control the host system. The high level of obfuscation and system interaction points strongly toward malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its obfuscation, system modifications, package installations, and API calls indicate intent to perform unauthorized or harmful actions. It should be considered a high security risk and treated as malware or sabotage.",
