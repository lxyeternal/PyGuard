  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The embedded command and its execution context are suspicious, warranting classification as malicious or compromised. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified; decoding the payload would confirm malicious activity, but current evidence strongly suggests malicious behavior."
