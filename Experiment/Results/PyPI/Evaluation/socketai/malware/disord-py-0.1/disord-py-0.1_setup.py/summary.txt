  "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated and performs system-level actions that are characteristic of malware. Its use of indirect system calls, dynamic string manipulation, and conditional execution based on obscure calculations point to malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (close to 1), malware score (~0.9), and risk score (~0.9) are justified. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, warranting further analysis and caution against deployment."
