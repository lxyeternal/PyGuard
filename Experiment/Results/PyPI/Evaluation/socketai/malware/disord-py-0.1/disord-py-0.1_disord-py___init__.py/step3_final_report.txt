  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for potential malicious behavior, focusing on supply chain risks, obfuscation, and security vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file modification, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From sources like hardcoded secrets or eval() inputs to sinks such as network or file operations, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() with untrusted input, hardcoded URLs or credentials, obfuscated variable names, complex control flow, absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code in report 3 exhibits red flags: dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and complex control flow, indicating high malicious potential. Reports 1, 2, and 5 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, justified by their low scores. Report 4 lacks code, so no analysis is possible. The scores for report 3 are appropriate given the evidence, with malware at 0.6-0.7, obfuscation at 0.7-0.75, and risk at 0.75. The other reports are consistent with their benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "Report 3 contains suspicious code features justifying high malware and obfuscation scores, indicating likely malicious intent. The other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their safe analysis. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the described behaviors.",
