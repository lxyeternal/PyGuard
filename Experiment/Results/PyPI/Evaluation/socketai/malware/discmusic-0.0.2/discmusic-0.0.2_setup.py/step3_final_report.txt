  "sources": "Static code in setup() defining package info, dependencies, author, description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author name 'Buggedoncord' but not malicious; no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic elements, user input, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The author name is unconventional but not malicious. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The code's static nature and dependency specification pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code.",
