  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, data handling functions, network interactions, and any code execution points.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network transmissions, data storage, or output functions where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) passing through processing functions to sinks like system calls or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution; none detected in the provided code.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or incomplete code with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious patterns. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting typical concerns with untrusted input handling but no concrete threats. Confidence levels vary based on information completeness, but overall reasoning is sound. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are cautious and justified given the limited data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions. No adjustments are necessary; the code is considered safe based on current evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
