  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input, environment variables, or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks, external communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that outputs a static message. It contains no external dependencies, data inputs, or network activity. All reviews confirm its benign nature. No malicious or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The reasoning across reports is consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
