{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, with custom commands that execute a function after installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc' function is invoked during custom 'develop' and 'install' commands, which calls 'b64d' to decode a base64-encoded string that contains a shell command.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 string is executed via 'os.system', which can run arbitrary shell commands, representing a potential sink for malicious code.",
  "flows": "The custom 'run' methods trigger 'notmalfunc', which decodes and executes the base64-encoded string, leading to execution of the embedded command during package installation or development setup.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 encoding for the command suggests an attempt to obfuscate the command. The command itself opens a URL ('https://ac9c-554-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app') in the default web browser or attempts to execute a shell command that likely involves network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup modules and defines a decoding function 'b64d' that converts a base64 string into ASCII code. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, is a shell command to open a URL. This function is called in custom setup commands ('AfterDevelop' and 'AfterInstall'), which execute the command during installation or development setup. The use of base64 encoding appears to obfuscate the command's intent, which is to open an external URL, potentially for tracking, C2 communication, or other malicious purposes. No other suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious system modifications are evident outside this obfuscation. The overall behavior indicates a potential for malicious activity during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes a URL-opening command during installation or development setup, indicating malicious intent for tracking or malicious communication. This behavior poses a security risk and should be flagged for review before use.",
