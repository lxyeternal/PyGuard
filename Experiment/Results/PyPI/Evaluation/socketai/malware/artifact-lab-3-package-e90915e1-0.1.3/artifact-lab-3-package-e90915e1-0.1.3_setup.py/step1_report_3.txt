  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that modifies installation and development commands to execute additional code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded in the notmalfunc() function, which is executed during install and develop commands.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the decoded command, which makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "flows": "The setup commands trigger notmalfunc(), which decodes and executes the command via os.system, leading to an HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a command that makes an HTTP request during package installation/development. The code structure is typical of setup scripts but includes obfuscated remote communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines a function to decode base64-encoded code. The function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string which, when decoded, is a shell command that opens a URL in a browser (or makes an HTTP request). The setup class overrides 'develop' and 'install' commands to run notmalfunc() after the standard procedure. This behavior occurs during package installation or development setup, potentially executing arbitrary code or communicating with a remote server. The use of base64 to hide this behavior indicates an intent to conceal malicious or undesired remote communication, which could be used for tracking, command and control, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to execute a remote HTTP request during package installation or development setup, using obfuscation via base64 encoding. This behavior can be malicious, potentially tracking or exfiltrating data, or contacting a command and control server. The obfuscation and execution during setup raise significant security concerns.",
