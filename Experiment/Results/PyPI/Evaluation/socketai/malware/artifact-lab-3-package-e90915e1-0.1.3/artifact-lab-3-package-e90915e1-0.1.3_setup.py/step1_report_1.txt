{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including custom commands for 'develop' and 'install' that execute additional code after the standard procedures.",
  "sources": "The 'notmalfunc' function, called during the custom command runs, reads a base64-encoded string and decodes it to execute a system command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a command decoded from base64, which can run arbitrary code or network operations.",
  "flows": "The custom command classes invoke 'notmalfunc', which decodes base64 string to obtain and execute a shell command, establishing a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The base64-encoded string decodes to a command that performs an HTTP request to a suspicious domain. Use of base64 for obfuscation and the dynamic execution of decoded code are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a helper function 'b64d' to decode base64 strings. Two custom command classes ('AfterDevelop' and 'AfterInstall') extend setuptools commands and override 'run' to call 'notmalfunc'. The 'notmalfunc' function decodes a base64 string, which represents a shell command that performs an HTTP request to 'ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app'. This command is executed via 'os.system', which can run arbitrary code. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent. The overall setup appears to be designed to execute this network request upon installation or development setup, which could be used for malicious purposes such as command-and-control communication, data exfiltration, or establishing backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution of a network request during package installation or development setup, indicating malicious behavior. The use of base64 encoding and execution of decoded code is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
