{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that execute a function upon installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The b64d function decoding a base64-encoded string which is then executed via os.system in notmalfunc().",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code; the base64-encoded string is a potential sink if it contains malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 string and executes it immediately during package installation or development setup, creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with os.system to execute arbitrary code. The encoded string decodes to a command that makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain. This indicates obfuscated execution of potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for base64 decoding and executes a command decoded from base64 when the package is installed or set up for development. The decoded string is a cURL command to an external domain, which could be malicious or used for tracking. The use of base64 and dynamic execution through os.system is suspicious as it obfuscates behavior. There are no other suspicious or malicious code components, but the execution of external code at install time is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an obfuscated command that makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain during package setup, which could be malicious or tracking behavior. The use of base64 encoding to hide this behavior suggests malicious intent. This code should be flagged for security review.",
