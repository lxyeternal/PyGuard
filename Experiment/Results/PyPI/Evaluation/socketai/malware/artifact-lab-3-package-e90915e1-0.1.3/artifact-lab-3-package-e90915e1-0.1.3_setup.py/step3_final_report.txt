{
  "purpose": "The code executes a base64-encoded shell command during package setup, which makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain, indicating potential malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "sources": "The base64 string decoded in 'notmalfunc()', executed via os.system during 'develop' and 'install' commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded shell command that performs a network request.",
  "flows": "Decode base64 string -> execute shell command via os.system -> HTTP request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a remote network request during package setup; no other malicious code or credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides setup commands to run 'notmalfunc()', which decodes a base64 string that, when executed, contacts a suspicious URL. The obfuscation via base64 and the remote contact during install/develop are suspicious behaviors. The code contains no other malicious payloads or hardcoded secrets. The remote URL contact during setup is indicative of potential command-and-control or data exfiltration activities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, risk ~0.75-0.9) are consistent with this behavior. Given the active remote contact during package installation and obfuscation, the overall security risk is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by executing obfuscated remote commands during setup, indicating a high likelihood of sabotage or malicious intent. The scores are justified and should lead to the package being flagged as malicious or requiring further scrutiny.",
