  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that modifies the install and develop commands to execute additional code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded by b64d function, which is executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which makes an HTTP request to a specific URL.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string in notmalfunc, then calls os.system with the decoded command, resulting in a network request to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obscure command execution, execution of external URL, no explicit hardcoded credentials but obfuscation suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to decode base64-encoded strings and executes them via os.system in the custom develop and install commands. The base64 string decodes to a curl command that fetches from 'https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app'. This indicates an attempt to execute remote code or contact a remote server during installation or development setup, which is suspicious. The obfuscation via base64 encoding is commonly used to hide malicious behavior. No other malicious code or hardcoded secrets are evident, but the behavior itself poses a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a remote request during package installation or development setup, indicating potentially malicious behavior. The obfuscation and network contact are suspicious and should be reviewed further. It is likely malicious, representing a security threat.",
