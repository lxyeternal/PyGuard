  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, author details, description, and empty URL/license fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or external data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static package metadata definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Empty URL and license fields, which may indicate incomplete configuration but are not malicious. No code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It includes static package metadata such as name, version, author info, and description. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or dynamic behaviors. The absence of URL and license details is a concern for completeness but not malicious. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The package metadata appears incomplete but benign.",
