      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics justify a malware score of approximately 0.9, obfuscated score of 0.9, and overall security risk around 0.9. It should not be trusted or deployed without decoding and analyzing the payload to confirm its behavior."
