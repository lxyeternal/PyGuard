{
  "purpose": "This code executes a reverse shell payload during package setup, establishing a backdoor for remote access.",
  "sources": "The os.system() call within the post_install() function, executed immediately after setup()",
  "sinks": "The reverse shell command connects to an external IP, providing remote control over the host system",
  "flows": "The code calls post_install() right after setup(), which then runs os.system() executing the reverse shell command",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of malicious reverse shell during package installation; hardcoded IP and port; no benign explanation for this behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a post_install() function that runs a reverse shell command via os.system(). This function is called directly after setup(), causing the malicious payload to execute during installation. The reverse shell command connects to an external IP, allowing remote control. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and explicitly contains malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1) are justified given the high severity of the payload. The high confidence scores reflect the clarity of the malicious intent. No false positives or assumptions are present; the behavior is unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear and explicit malicious backdoor via a reverse shell payload executed during package setup. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. This represents a severe supply chain security threat and should be considered malicious.",
