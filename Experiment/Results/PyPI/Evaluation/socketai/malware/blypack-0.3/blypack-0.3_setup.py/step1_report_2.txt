{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'blypack' and executes a function 'post_install' immediately after the setup script runs.",
  "sources": "The 'post_install' function uses 'os.system' to execute a command that opens a reverse shell connection to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call is a sink where untrusted command execution occurs, leading to remote access or control.",
  "flows": "The script runs 'post_install' immediately after the setup process, which then executes a network connection command, creating a flow from script execution to establishing a reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing a reverse shell command immediately after setup, which is atypical for legitimate package setup scripts. The code executes potentially malicious network activity without user consent or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', typical for Python package setup. However, the 'post_install' function contains a command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address. This function is called directly after the setup process, meaning every installation of this package would trigger this malicious behavior. The setup parameters are standard, but the execution of a reverse shell in 'post_install' is suspicious and likely malicious, as it allows remote control of the system where the package is installed. The code does not perform any validation or checks before executing this command, indicating malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation or benign explanation for this network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell command executed immediately after installation, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. This package is potentially harmful, designed to establish unauthorized remote access upon installation.",
