{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack'. It installs dependencies and then executes a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "The post_install() function executes a system command via os.system, which runs a Bash command to establish a reverse TCP shell connection to a remote IP address and port.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call with the reverse shell command is a sink that executes untrusted code on the host system, potentially leading to remote control of the system.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with the script execution, proceeds to the setup() call, and after that, directly calls post_install(), which executes the reverse shell command.",
  "anomalies": "The immediate execution of a reverse shell command after setup() is highly unusual and suspicious. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs, and runs a network connection designed to give remote access.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package and immediately calls post_install(). The post_install() function runs a Bash reverse shell to an external IP address, which is a typical malicious behavior indicating remote control or backdoor access. The code structure suggests an intent to gain unauthorized access upon installation. The rest of the setup code is benign, but the inclusion and immediate execution of the reverse shell is malicious. The script does not perform any other security checks or validation, making this a high-risk supply chain threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell connection upon installation, representing a significant security threat. The suspicious immediate execution of network access commands classifies this as malware with high confidence. The overall security risk is very high due to the embedded reverse shell.",
