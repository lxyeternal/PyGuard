{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'blypack' and execute a post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The 'post_install()' function, which executes a system command using os.system() that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call that runs a bash command to establish a reverse TCP connection to an external IP address (81.46.246.181:4444).",
  "flows": "The code executes post_install() after setup(), which in turn runs the malicious system command, creating a network connection to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run a potentially malicious bash reverse shell command; calling post_install() directly after setup() rather than through standard install hooks; no safeguards or checks around the execution of this command.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools' for package setup. The 'post_install()' function uses os.system() to run a bash command that opens a reverse shell connection to an external IP address, which is a common malicious behavior. The setup() function defines package metadata but does not include custom commands or hooks. After setup(), the script immediately calls post_install(), executing the malicious command. This flow indicates intent to establish unauthorized remote access when the package is installed. No other dependencies or code sections mitigate or restrict this behavior. The code explicitly contains a reverse shell payload, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious reverse shell payload that connects to an external IP address upon installation. This is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The script is designed to compromise the system that installs the package by opening a remote backdoor.",
