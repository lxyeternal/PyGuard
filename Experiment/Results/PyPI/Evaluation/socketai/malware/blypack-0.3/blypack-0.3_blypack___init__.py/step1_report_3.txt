  "sources": "No explicit input sources; potential import statements or code might be elsewhere",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows observable in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only a comment line with no executable code, which is unusual for an init file, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment indicating the filename. There are no variables, functions, imports, or executable statements present. As an __init__.py file, it typically initializes a package but currently lacks any code to do so. No suspicious or malicious activity is detectable based on this minimal content.",
  "conclusion": "The file contains no executable code or suspicious elements; it appears to be a placeholder or minimal init file. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
