  "purpose": "Initialization of the mi_paquete package, likely to set up namespace and imports.",
  "sources": "No input reading sources detected in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output points present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Empty init file; no code, no secrets, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a filename indicating an __init__.py file within a package. No executable code, imports, or logic are present. This makes the file inert and unlikely to contain malicious behavior or security issues. The absence of code also implies no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal package initializer with no executable content. It poses no security risk or malicious intent based on the available information.",
