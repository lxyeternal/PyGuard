  "anomalies": "None; the file is a standard, minimal __init__.py with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is an empty or minimal __init__.py file, serving as a package marker. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable code, data handling, or malicious patterns. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the file. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its harmlessness. No anomalies or issues are detected, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, minimal package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores or further analysis are necessary.",
