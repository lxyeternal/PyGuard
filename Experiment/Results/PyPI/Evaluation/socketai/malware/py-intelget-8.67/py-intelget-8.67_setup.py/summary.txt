  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup, representing a high security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.8, security risk 0.85) are appropriate and justified given the evidence."
