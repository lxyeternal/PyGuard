  "conclusion": "The code contains a stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed prior to package setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The techniques employed are typical of malware, and the silent error handling conceals potential failures. While the payload is not decoded, the suspicious behavior warrants classifying this as highly malicious with high security risk."
