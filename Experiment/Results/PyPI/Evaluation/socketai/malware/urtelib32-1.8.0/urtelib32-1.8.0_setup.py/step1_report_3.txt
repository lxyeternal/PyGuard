  "purpose": "Custom installation process that attempts to elevate privileges and download an image from a remote server, then decode and display it.",
  "sources": "Remote URL request to 'http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png'; reading local file 'image.png'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to local file 'image.png'; decoding and printing content from 'image.png'.",
  "flows": "Requests data from remote server -> saves to 'image.png' -> reads 'image.png' -> attempts to decode and print.",
  "anomalies": "Elevates privileges without user consent; downloads and processes remote content; decodes base64 content from an image file; hardcoded URL and headers; use of 'ShellExecuteW' with 'runas' for privilege escalation; no clear legitimate purpose for image download and decode.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process by introducing a custom installation class. It checks for administrator privileges, attempts to elevate if not already admin, then downloads a file from a remote server using 'requests'. It saves this data as 'image.png', then reads and attempts to decode the file's content with base64, printing the result. This behavior is suspicious because it involves privilege escalation, downloading remote content, and decoding/displaying it without explanation, potentially indicating malicious activity such as secret data exfiltration, backdoor setup, or malware delivery. The code does not use the downloaded content for any apparent legitimate purpose. The use of 'ctypes' for privilege escalation and the hardcoded URL are typical indicators of malicious or intrusive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, including privilege escalation, remote code/data retrieval, and hidden decoding. These actions are performed without user consent and lack legitimate justification, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
