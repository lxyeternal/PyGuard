  "purpose": "Custom installation process that attempts to elevate privileges, download an image from a remote server, and decode its contents.",
  "sources": "HTTP request to 'http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png', reading from 'image.png' file",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'image.png', decoding and printing base64 content from the downloaded image",
  "flows": "HTTP request -> save image as 'image.png' -> read 'image.png' -> decode base64 content and print",
  "anomalies": "Attempts to escalate privileges unconditionally; downloads and processes data from a remote server; decodes base64 data from an image file; no validation or sanitization; presence of hardcoded URL and headers; no clear purpose for decoding image content; use of ctypes to check admin rights and escalate privileges",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. It checks for administrator rights on Windows; if not admin, it attempts to relaunch with elevated privileges. It then makes a request to a remote URL, downloads content into 'image.png', and attempts to decode and print the base64 data read from the image. The code does not validate the downloaded content, and the purpose of decoding the image is unclear. The remote server URL and headers are hardcoded, which could be malicious. The privilege escalation attempt and remote code download are typical signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The code does not contain obfuscated code or typical malware indicators beyond these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits potentially malicious behavior by attempting privilege escalation, downloading and processing remote data, and decoding content without validation. It appears designed to run with elevated privileges and fetch remote data, which could be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary code. Overall, this code is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
