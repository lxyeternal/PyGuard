  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to elevate privileges and download an image file, then decode and display its content.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL to download an image, reading and writing 'image.png', and decoding its content.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'image.png', decoding and printing base64 data, executing system privilege elevation.",
  "flows": "Code retrieves data from external server, writes to disk, reads back, decodes, and prints it; also attempts to elevate privileges.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URL with potentially malicious content, privilege escalation via ShellExecuteW, decoding and printing arbitrary data, dynamic code execution pattern, and lack of clear purpose for downloaded data.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the installation process by defining a custom install class. It checks for administrative rights and attempts to elevate privileges if not already admin. It then downloads data from a specified URL, saves it as 'image.png', and tries to decode its content as base64 and print it. This behavior is suspicious as it involves retrieving external data and executing privilege escalation, which could be used for malicious activities like executing arbitrary code or exfiltrating data. The URL and headers are unusual, and the purpose of decoding and printing the data is unclear, potentially serving as a covert data exfiltration or backdoor mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behaviors such as privilege escalation, downloading external content, and decoding unknown data, which may be malicious or a backdoor. Its purpose is unclear, and it exhibits techniques that are common in malicious code. Caution is advised before using or trusting this package.",
