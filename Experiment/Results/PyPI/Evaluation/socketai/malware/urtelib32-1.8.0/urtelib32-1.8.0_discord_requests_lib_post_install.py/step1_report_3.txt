  "purpose": "Fetch and execute code from a remote server.",
  "sources": "requests.get call to remote URL, response.json() to retrieve 'code'.",
  "sinks": "exec(code) executes the retrieved code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "requests.get -> response.json() -> exec(code).",
  "anomalies": "Fetching code from an external source and executing it directly without validation or sanitization; hardcoded URL and header; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL with hardcoded headers. It retrieves a JSON response and extracts the 'code' field. If 'code' exists, it executes it directly using exec(), which is highly dangerous as it allows remote code execution. The lack of validation, error handling, or sandboxing indicates malicious intent or at least a high security risk. The hardcoded 'auth' header and the remote fetch pattern are typical indicators of malicious or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches executable code from a remote server and runs it without validation, representing a high security risk and potential backdoor or malware activity.",
