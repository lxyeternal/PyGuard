  "purpose": "Fetch and execute code from a remote server based on API response.",
  "sources": "requests.get to URL 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/'",
  "sinks": "exec(code) - executes dynamically fetched code, potentially untrusted.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data -> response.json().get('code') extracts code -> exec(code) executes the code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() on code received over network; hardcoded header 'auth' with suspicious value; external URL is non-standard and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to a remote URL with a specific header. It then extracts a 'code' field from the JSON response. If 'code' exists, it executes this code dynamically using exec(). This pattern is highly suspicious because executing code fetched over the network can lead to malicious behavior, such as system compromise, data theft, or persistence mechanisms. The 'auth' header has a placeholder-like value '&&CD&&ON', which might be an attempt to obfuscate or encode intent. The URL domain appears non-standard and potentially malicious. Overall, the code's intent is to run remote code, which is a common technique for malware deployment or backdoor establishment.",
  "conclusion": "The script fetches code from a suspicious external source and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent. It could be used for remote command execution, malware delivery, or other malicious activities. The use of exec() with remote data significantly raises security concerns.",
