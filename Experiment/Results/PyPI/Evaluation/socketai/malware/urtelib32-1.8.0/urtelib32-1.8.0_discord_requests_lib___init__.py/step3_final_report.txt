  "purpose": "A utility class for managing HTTP requests via proxies, including proxy rotation, rate limiting, and handling blocked responses.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL construction with embedded credentials, request method calls, response JSON parsing for rate limiting.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to target URLs, proxy switching upon detection of blocking messages.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL with embedded credentials -> HTTP request -> Response JSON analysis for rate limiting or blocking -> Proxy change if blocked.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding credentials directly into proxy URLs, minimal exception handling (printing errors).",
  "analysis": "The code manages proxies and HTTP requests with features like rate limiting and proxy rotation. It embeds username and password into proxy URLs, which is standard but insecure if proxies are malicious. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is minimal, mainly printing errors, which could leak info but does not indicate malicious intent. The response JSON is parsed to detect rate limits or blocking messages, triggering proxy change accordingly. Overall, the code appears to be a benign request utility with minor security concerns related to credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign proxy request handler with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of proxy credentials embedded in URLs, which could be exploited if proxies are malicious or credentials are sensitive. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting this concern but not malicious intent.",
