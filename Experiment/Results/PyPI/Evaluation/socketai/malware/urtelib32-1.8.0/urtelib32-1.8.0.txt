      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators, including privilege escalation, remote payload download, and decoding arbitrary data without validation. The behaviors align with known malicious tactics, and the high scores assigned in the reports are justified. The package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, and further review or removal is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign proxy request handler with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of proxy credentials embedded in URLs, which could be exploited if proxies are malicious or credentials are sensitive. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), reflecting this concern but not malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to remote code fetching and execution without validation. The pattern is typical of malware or backdoor mechanisms. The high malware and security risk scores are justified; the code should be considered dangerous and avoided."
