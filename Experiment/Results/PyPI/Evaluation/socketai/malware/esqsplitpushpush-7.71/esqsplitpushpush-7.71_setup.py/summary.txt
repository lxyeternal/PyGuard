  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command embedded within a setup script, strongly indicating malicious activity such as payload download, backdoor, or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation and execution context justify assigning a malware score of 0.8, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.85. Immediate further analysis and caution are recommended before use or distribution."
