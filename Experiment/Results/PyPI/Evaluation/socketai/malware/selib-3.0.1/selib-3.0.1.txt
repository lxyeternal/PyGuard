All evidence supports a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be flagged and avoided."

While the remaining code appears to be a terminal UI library, the initial obfuscated code execution is a red flag for malicious activity. It should be treated as malicious and thoroughly analyzed before any deployment or use."
