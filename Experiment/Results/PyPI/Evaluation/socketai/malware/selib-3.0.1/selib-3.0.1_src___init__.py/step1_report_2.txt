  "purpose": "This code provides various terminal and color management utilities, including text coloring, cursor control, window sizing, and animated text effects for terminal-based interfaces.",
  "sources": "Decodes a base64-encoded script at startup; reads environment variables (_name); reads terminal size (_terminal_size); reads user input via input(); reads terminal cursor size and info on Windows; reads system commands and executes them via _system().",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands via _system() which could be exploited if malicious input is passed; takes user input without validation in Error() and _input(), potentially enabling injection if misused; outputs text with user-supplied content in various formatting functions, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "flows": "User input in Error() and _input() functions can flow into the console; system commands in System.Command() flow into the OS; text and color parameters flow into terminal output functions.",
  "anomalies": "Decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically using exec() and compile() without any validation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The decoded code appears to import modules, access URLs, and perform requests, which could be malicious or sabotage code. The use of exec() with decoded code is a significant anomaly indicating possible hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically, which is an immediate red flag for malicious intent. The payload imports modules and performs network requests (e.g., to 'https://rentry.co/7nqxxy/raw'), which could be used for data exfiltration, command and control, or other malicious actions. The rest of the code defines terminal manipulation, color, animation, and UI functions, which are benign by themselves, but the initial dynamic execution introduces a strong suspicion of malicious intent. No other parts of the code contain evident malicious behavior, but the initial obfuscated code execution is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a critical malicious anomaly in its initial base64 decoding and dynamic execution, indicating malicious behavior. This suggests an attempt to hide or obfuscate malicious code, which could be used for data theft, remote command execution, or other harmful actions. The remaining code appears to be UI/UX utilities for terminal interfaces, but they are likely included to mask or support malicious activities.",
