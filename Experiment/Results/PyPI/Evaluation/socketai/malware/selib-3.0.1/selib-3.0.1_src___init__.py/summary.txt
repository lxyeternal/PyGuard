  "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload that executes dynamically at startup, representing a high security threat. While the remaining code appears to be a terminal UI library, the initial obfuscated code execution is a red flag for malicious activity. It should be treated as malicious and thoroughly analyzed before any deployment or use."
