{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'selib' package, primarily for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec() at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call executes dynamically decoded code, which could potentially lead to malicious activity if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "Base64 decode -> compile -> exec; the decoded code imports modules, possibly downloads or executes additional code, and performs other actions.",
  "anomalies": "The use of dynamic execution with base64 decoding and compilation is unusual and potentially malicious, especially in a setup script. This pattern is often used to obfuscate malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a base64-encoded string that is decoded, compiled, and executed dynamically. This decoded code imports 'tempfile', 'sys', and 'os' modules, and performs a request to a suspicious URL ('https://pst.k-lgtrg.io/paste/hhzzp/r...') which suggests malicious intent such as retrieving external code or data. The rest of the setup code appears legitimate, configuring package details. The initial obfuscated code poses a significant security risk because it can execute arbitrary code, potentially harmful, without clear visibility.",
  "conclusion": "The presence of obfuscated, dynamically executed code that contacts a suspicious external URL indicates malicious intent. The setup script contains a hidden payload that could compromise systems. This package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
