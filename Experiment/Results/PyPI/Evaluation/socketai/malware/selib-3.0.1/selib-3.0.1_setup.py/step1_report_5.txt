  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'selib' Python package, intended to facilitate colorful console output.",
  "sources": "The embedded base64-encoded string which is decoded and executed dynamically at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decoded code that could lead to malicious actions if the decoded content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded code is executed directly via exec, which could lead to malicious payloads being run at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding and dynamic execution (exec) to run embedded code. The code appears intentionally obfuscated to hide its behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a minimal setup for a Python package using setuptools, which is standard. However, it then imports 'base64' and executes a base64-encoded string after decoding. The decoded code imports 'tempfile' and 'webrequest', and attempts to fetch content from a suspicious URL ('https://pst.kgtrg.io/paste/hzzzp/ray') and write it to a temporary file, then read and execute it. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it downloads and runs remote code during package installation, which is a supply chain attack vector. The use of __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(__import__('base64').b64decode(...))) is a clear obfuscation technique intended to hide malicious code. No other benign or expected behavior is visible outside this malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an embedded, obfuscated payload that, when executed, downloads and runs code from a remote server, indicating malicious behavior. This is a high-risk supply chain attack embedded within a seemingly benign setup script.",
