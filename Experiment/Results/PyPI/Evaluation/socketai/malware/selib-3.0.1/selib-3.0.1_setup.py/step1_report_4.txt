{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'selib' Python package, intended to provide console coloring features.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data in the setup parameters; also, it imports standard libraries and executes decoded base64 code dynamically.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic execution of decoded code via exec() can lead to executing malicious code if the base64 payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoded code executes immediately upon import, which may lead to malicious payload execution before setup completes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code using base64 decoding and exec(). The initial import includes a heavily obfuscated segment that decodes and executes code, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a standard setup configuration for a Python package but then immediately imports 'builtins' and executes dynamically decoded code. The base64 string decodes to code that imports 'tempfile', 'web', 'http', and performs network requests and file operations, including writing to 'HZZZz.zip'. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing remote payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The rest of the script appears to be legitimate setup parameters, but the initial obfuscated code is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic execution that decodes and runs potentially malicious code, representing a high security risk. This is indicative of malicious behavior intended to execute unknown payloads upon package import. The setup configuration itself is standard but overshadowed by the malicious obfuscation.",
