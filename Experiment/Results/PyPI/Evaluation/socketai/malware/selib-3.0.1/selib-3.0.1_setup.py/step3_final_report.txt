{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload, compiles, and executes it dynamically during setup, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which contains code that contacts external URLs and performs network requests.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code that contacts external domains, downloads or executes remote payloads, and manipulates files or system resources.",
  "flows": "Decode base64 -> compile -> execute during import; the decoded code then contacts external URLs and performs actions based on remote responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with dynamic compile and exec(), obfuscation of payload, network requests to suspicious domains, and code execution during package setup.",
  "analysis": "The initial code employs obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding, dynamic execution) to hide malicious payloads. The decoded code contacts external URLs, likely to download or execute malicious remote code, representing a supply chain attack vector. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload is malicious. All reports correctly identify this pattern, assigning high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The behavior aligns with known malicious tactics to hide remote code execution during package installation, posing a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly obfuscated malicious code that contacts external servers and executes remote payloads, indicating a supply chain attack. All evidence supports a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be flagged and avoided.",
