{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'selib' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the base64-encoded string within the __import__('builtins').exec() call, and from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially execute decoded code dynamically, which may execute malicious payloads if the encoded string is malicious. No other untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded, compiled, and executed via exec(). This is a source-to-sink flow, as it executes arbitrary code at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of __import__('builtins').exec() with dynamically decoded base64 data is highly unusual and suspicious in a setup script. This pattern can be used to hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then executes a hidden code segment decoded from base64. This decoded code, upon decoding, imports modules, and runs a request to an external URL, then closes the stream. The decoded code appears to be obfuscated, executing network activity which could be malicious. The setup() function appears normal, but the initial code execution is suspicious, as it can run arbitrary code. The rest of the code is a typical setup script with package metadata and dependencies, but the initial obfuscated code raises concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated code executed at runtime, which could be malicious. It may perform malicious network activity or other harmful actions hidden behind the obfuscation. The rest of the setup code seems standard but is overshadowed by the malicious code execution. Overall, high suspicion of malicious intent.",
