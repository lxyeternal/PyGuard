{
  "purpose": "The function getuserinfo is intended to retrieve information about a logged-in user.",
  "sources": "The code imports the requests library, which can be used to perform HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the function body is empty and does not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the function is unimplemented and contains no code.",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation, which may be suspicious in some contexts but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library but does not use it. The function getuserinfo is a placeholder with no logic, parameters, or operations. There are no data reads, data processing, or network operations within the code snippet. The absence of implementation makes it difficult to assess malicious intent, but nothing in the code suggests malicious behavior or malicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a stub for a user info retrieval function, with no active logic or potential security risks. It does not contain malware or security issues as-is.",
