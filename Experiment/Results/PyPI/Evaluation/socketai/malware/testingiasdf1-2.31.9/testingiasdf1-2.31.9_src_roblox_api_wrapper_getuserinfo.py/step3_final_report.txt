{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to retrieve user information, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "None, as the function body is empty; the only import 'requests' is unused.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flow present; function does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in the current code.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'requests'; function is a stub with no logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no active logic, data flow, or network activity. The import of 'requests' is unused, indicating incomplete implementation. No malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in previous reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the code's inert state. The overall assessment confirms the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete stub with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (0) being appropriate. The current scores are consistent with the code's state, and no modifications are necessary.",
