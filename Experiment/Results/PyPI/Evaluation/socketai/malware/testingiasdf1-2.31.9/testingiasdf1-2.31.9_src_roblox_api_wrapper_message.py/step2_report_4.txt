  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets are simple placeholder functions with no implementation (`pass` or empty body).\n- There are no data flows, external calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports correctly identify the lack of logic and malicious activity.\n- Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, which is appropriate given the absence of actual functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all snippets are placeholders with no operational code.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports:** No significant flaws; the reports are accurate in describing the code as a stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justifications:**\n  - Malware scores are zero, consistent with no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - Risk scores are minimal, reflecting the lack of active code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a placeholder with no security issues.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are noted.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  Given the code's nature, the current scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n- **Risk scoring justification:**  \n  Since there's no active code, no external calls, and no data processing, the risk score should remain very low (close to 0). The current scores reflect this accurately.\n\n- **Malware scoring:**  \n  Confirmed as zero; no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero (current scores are appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a non-functional placeholder with no malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, placeholder nature of the code snippets provided.",
