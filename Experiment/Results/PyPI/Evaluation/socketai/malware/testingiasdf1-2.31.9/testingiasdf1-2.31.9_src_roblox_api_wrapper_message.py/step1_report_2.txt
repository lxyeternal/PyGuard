{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' that may contain input data",
  "sinks": "The function body is empty; potential sinks would be any implementation that sends data over network or writes to files",
  "flows": "Input parameters are received; no further flow occurs as the function body is empty",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' with three parameters but does not implement any logic. There are no data reads, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The lack of implementation makes it impossible to determine malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and does not suggest hidden malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder with no active logic or suspicious behavior. It does not pose any security risk in its current form.",
