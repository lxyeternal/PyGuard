{
  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are input sources.",
  "sinks": "The function body is empty ('pass'), so no sinks are currently present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs since the function does nothing.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a placeholder with no implementation; no anomalies are evident in this minimal code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' that accepts user, recipient, and message parameters but performs no actions. There are no data processing, no data transmission, and no external interactions. The absence of logic or data handling prevents any malicious activity. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal placeholder with no operational behavior and no signs of malicious intent. It does not perform any actions that could pose security risks.",
