  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a User object to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function potentially sends or processes the 'message' data; actual send mechanism is not implemented, but the parameters could be exploited if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('user', 'recipient', 'message') flow into the function; however, since the function is empty, no actual data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation; no anomalies or malicious code are present in the current snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code defines a placeholder function intended for message transmission between users. It does not contain any logic, data processing, or external calls. The absence of implementation means there are no security issues, suspicious behavior, or malicious activity in this snippet. The code itself is minimal and does not execute any operations that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or unsafe patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder with no functional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be a part of a larger system, and without further implementation details, it poses no security threat.",
