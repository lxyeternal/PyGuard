{
  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a User object to a recipient with a specified message.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as parameters; no data reading beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function body is empty; no sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the function but no processing occurs; no data flow to sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation, no code execution, no data handling, no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but does not implement any logic. It appears as a placeholder or interface rather than actual functionality. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows, nor any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Without further implementation details, it is impossible to determine malicious intent. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.",
  "conclusion": "This is an empty placeholder function with no operational code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code alone is harmless but incomplete.",
