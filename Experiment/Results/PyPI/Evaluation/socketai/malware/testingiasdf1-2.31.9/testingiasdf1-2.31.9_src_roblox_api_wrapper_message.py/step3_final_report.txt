  "purpose": "The code defines a placeholder function 'send' intended to send messages from a User to a recipient, but it currently contains no implementation.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are inputs to the function; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the function does not process or transmit data; it merely passes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing steps within the function; it is an empty stub.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function definition with no implementation, external calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as a placeholder. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of malicious or risky behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as a stub without malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
