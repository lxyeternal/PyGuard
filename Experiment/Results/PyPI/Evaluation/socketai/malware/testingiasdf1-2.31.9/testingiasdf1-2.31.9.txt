      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through remote code fetching, extraction, and execution without validation, representing a severe security threat. The high malware and risk scores are justified. It should be flagged as highly malicious and removed or sandboxed to prevent potential system compromise."

      "conclusion": "The supply chain security risk in these dependencies is generally low, with some caution advised for code exhibiting dynamic execution patterns. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 4 to reflect potential risks. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal malicious activity detected."

The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (0) being appropriate. The current scores are consistent with the code's state, and no modifications are necessary."
