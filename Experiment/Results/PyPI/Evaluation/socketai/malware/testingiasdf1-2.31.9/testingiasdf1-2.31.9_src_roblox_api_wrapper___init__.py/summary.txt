  "conclusion": "The supply chain security risk in these dependencies is generally low, with some caution advised for code exhibiting dynamic execution patterns. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 4 to reflect potential risks. Overall, the dependency appears safe with minimal malicious activity detected."
