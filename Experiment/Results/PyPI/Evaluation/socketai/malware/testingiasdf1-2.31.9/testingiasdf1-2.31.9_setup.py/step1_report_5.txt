  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading multiple zip files from potentially suspicious URLs",
    "Immediate extraction of zip files without validation or integrity checks",
    "Execution of remote code via exec() after base64 decoding, which is inherently risky",
    "Lack of validation or sanitization for the downloaded code",
    "No authentication or verification of remote server content"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script sets up a package configuration with setuptools, then proceeds to download multiple zip files from a suspicious domain and extracts them directly, which could contain malicious payloads. It then fetches additional code from the server, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically with exec(), which is a common tactic for executing malicious code received from remote sources. The process lacks validation, checksums, or signatures, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads. The code behavior indicates high malicious potential, especially due to remote code execution without safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to downloading, extracting, and executing remote code without validation. The use of exec() on code fetched from a remote URL is especially concerning. Overall, this script is likely malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
