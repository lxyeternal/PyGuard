    "No validation or verification of downloaded files or code.",
    "Use of 'exec' on decoded data from URL, which is a high-risk activity."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard setup code, then proceeds to download multiple zip files from a suspicious external domain, extracting their contents without any validation. It also downloads additional code and executes it directly after base64 decoding. The direct execution of remote code via 'exec' after fetching from an untrusted URL is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The repeated downloading and extraction of files from untrusted sources, combined with dynamic code execution, pose significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by fetching, extracting, and executing remote code without validation, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. It appears designed to run arbitrary code from external sources, which is a critical security threat.",
