  "purpose": "Setup Python package and dynamically download, extract, and execute remote code modules.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, retrieving files via URL, reading remote package data",
  "sinks": "exec with decoded base64 content, file downloads/extractions",
  "flows": "Readme read -> download zip files -> extract -> delete zips -> fetch package URL -> read data -> decode base64 -> execute",
  "anomalies": "Downloading executable content from external URLs and executing without validation; use of exec on remote data; no verification of content; potential for malicious code execution",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools. However, it then proceeds to download multiple zip files from remote URLs, extracts them, and deletes the zip files. Critically, it retrieves a package name from a URL, reads its content, base64-decodes it, and executes it via eval(). This remote execution of arbitrary code is a major security risk, especially without any validation, signature verification, or checksums. The code thus potentially executes malicious payloads delivered from the specified URLs. The downloading and extraction of modules might be for obfuscation or concealment, but the key concern is the remote execution of code fetched over the network, which is inherently dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code execution via eval on unverified content. It downloads multiple modules dynamically, which could be benign or malicious, but the direct execution of remote content without validation strongly indicates malicious intent or security risk. The overall security risk is high.",
