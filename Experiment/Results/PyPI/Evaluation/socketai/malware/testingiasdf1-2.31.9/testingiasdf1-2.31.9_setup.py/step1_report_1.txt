  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing code from untrusted external URLs without validation",
    "Use of exec() on code fetched from remote server, potentially malicious",
    "Repeated extraction of zip files without validation or checksums",
    "No verification of the downloaded content's integrity or source"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple downloads from a suspicious domain, extracting the contents without validation, and then executes code directly from a remote source via base64 decoding and exec(). This pattern indicates potential malicious behavior, as it could allow remote code execution and installation of harmful payloads. The use of external sources and immediate execution poses high security risks. No checksums, signatures, or validation mechanisms are implemented, increasing the danger.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading, extracting, and executing remote code without validation, which is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. It indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent or compromise.",
