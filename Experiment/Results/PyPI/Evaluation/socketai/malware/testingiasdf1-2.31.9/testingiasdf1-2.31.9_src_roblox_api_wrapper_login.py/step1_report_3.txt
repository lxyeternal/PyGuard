  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox login via cookie or username/password",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks or data processing implemented",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no data handling or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for login purposes but does not implement any logic or data handling. There are no inputs being processed, no outputs, and no side effects. This appears to be a scaffold or stub code, not functional or malicious. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic scaffold with no operational logic or malicious intent. It does not pose any security risk as-is but does not perform any actual login or data handling. It appears to be placeholder code, not malicious malware or security risk.",
