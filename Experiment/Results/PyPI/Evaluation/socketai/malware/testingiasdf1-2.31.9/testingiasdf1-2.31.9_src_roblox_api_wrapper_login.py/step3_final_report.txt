  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function definitions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin' with 'pass' statements.",
  "sinks": "None, as functions do nothing; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are empty and inert.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty placeholders with no implementation; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two stub functions with no logic, data processing, or network activity. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The functions are inert, serving as scaffolds for future development. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the current benign state, though the risk could be lowered to 0. as there is no active security concern. The high confidence scores reflect the certainty that the code is harmless in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely placeholder functions with no operational logic or malicious activity. The current security risk is minimal, and the code poses no threat. The scores are consistent with this assessment, though the risk score could be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
