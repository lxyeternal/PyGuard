  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into roblox.com API, likely for automation or account access.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' inputs",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present; functions are currently empty",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs as functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; potential placeholder for future malicious code, but currently inactive",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for authentication: 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'. Both functions are empty with no internal logic, no data processing, and no external interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network calls, or data leaks present. Given their empty state, they pose no immediate security risk or malicious behavior. However, their presence suggests potential for future implementation that could be misused, but as-is, they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains placeholder functions with no active code or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident at this stage. The functions could be misused if implemented maliciously later, but in their current state, they are harmless.",
