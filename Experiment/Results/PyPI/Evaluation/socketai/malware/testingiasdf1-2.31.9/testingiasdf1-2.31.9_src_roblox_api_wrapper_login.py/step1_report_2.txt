  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login procedures to the Roblox API",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' which are intended as input data",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; functions currently do nothing with the inputs",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the functions are empty and contain only 'pass' statements",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two stub functions with no logic, data processing, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The functions appear to be placeholders for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is minimal, consisting of empty function definitions without any operational logic. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are evident at this stage.",
