  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external inputs, code snippets, network interactions, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), suspicious imports.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, dynamic code execution points, environment variables, hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with unverified input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code constructs, suspicious imports, network activity indicative of potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion across reports. Reports 1, 2, and 4 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, supported by high confidence and low malware scores. Report 3 contains obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a moderate malware score (~0.4) and obfuscation (~0.4), reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Report 5 displays multiple red flags, including eval/exec with untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and network activity, justifying high malware (~0.7), obfuscation (~0.7), and security risk (~0.75) scores. Adjustments are recommended to better align scores with the observed suspicious patterns, notably increasing Report 3's malware score from 0.2 to approximately 0.4 and maintaining high scores for Report 5. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with most code deemed safe and some exhibiting moderate to high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with low malware and risk scores. Reports 3 and 5 show moderate to high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious scores. The current scoring aligns well with the evidence; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious cases before deployment.",
