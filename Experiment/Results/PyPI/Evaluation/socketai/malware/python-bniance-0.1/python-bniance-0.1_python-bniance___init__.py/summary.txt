  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with low malware and risk scores. Reports 3 and 5 show moderate to high suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious scores. The current scoring aligns well with the evidence; minor adjustments improve accuracy. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious cases before deployment."
