      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior through obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell payload, indicating potential malicious activity. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload warrants further analysis. Scores of malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.9 are justified given the stealthy, obfuscated execution and potential for malicious intent."
