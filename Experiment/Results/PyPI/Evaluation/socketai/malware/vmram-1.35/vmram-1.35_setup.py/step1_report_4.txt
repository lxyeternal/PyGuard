  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'vmram' Python package, intended to install the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of the 'tahg' directory; importing modules; subprocess invocation; setup function call.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call that executes encoded PowerShell command, potentially executing malicious code; no other evident sinks.",
  "flows": "The script checks for 'tahg' directory, then potentially executes encoded PowerShell command if it does not exist, then runs setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess, which is unusual for a standard setup script. Use of try-except blocks that silently pass without logging errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup for a Python package named 'vmram' with standard metadata. However, it contains a suspicious subprocess call executing a hidden, encoded PowerShell command if a directory does not exist. The command is encoded, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, which can hide issues or malicious failures. The rest of the code appears benign, focusing on package installation details.",
  "conclusion": "While most of the code appears standard for a setup script, the encoded PowerShell command executed without logging is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. This command could perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The rest of the code does not show further malicious intent or security risks.",
