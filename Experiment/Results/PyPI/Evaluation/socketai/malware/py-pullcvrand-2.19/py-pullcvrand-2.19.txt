      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-confidence malicious activity through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, likely intended for malicious payload delivery or backdoor establishment. The high scores (malware: 0.9, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified by the evidence. The package should be considered compromised or malicious, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for full analysis."
