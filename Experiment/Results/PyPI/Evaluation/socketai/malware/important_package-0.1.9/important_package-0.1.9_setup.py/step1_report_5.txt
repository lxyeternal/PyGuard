  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'important_package' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing 'setuptools', defining package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "Read file -> assign to 'long_description' -> pass to 'setuptools.setup' as parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard 'setuptools' for packaging. No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations for a Python package. It reads a README file for documentation, specifies dependencies ('dnspython'), and provides package metadata. All code follows standard packaging conventions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The dependencies are publicly available and widely used. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, nor any dynamic or external code execution. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
