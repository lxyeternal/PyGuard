  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading README.md for long description, and defining package metadata with a single dependency 'dnspython'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, file modifications, or external output; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as input; static data used in setup parameters; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static, legitimate metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code. Dependencies are standard, and URLs are legitimate. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
