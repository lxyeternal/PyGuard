  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python packaging script.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The code only reads a README file and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static, legitimate parameters.\n- No external or untrusted data flows, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only dependency is `dnspython`, which is a well-known, legitimate library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues are present in the code itself.** The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **None identified.** All reports correctly identify the code as standard and non-malicious.\n\n### Scores assigned to each issue:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which is justified.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, network activity, or backdoors.\n- The only dependency is `dnspython`, which is legitimate.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports are cautious and correct, assuming no hidden malicious intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup script.\n- No untrusted data or external malicious code is involved.\n- The dependencies and URLs are legitimate.\n- The code follows standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided setup script is safe, legitimate, and carries no security risks. All reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
