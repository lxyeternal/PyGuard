{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation step that executes embedded code.",
  "sources": "Input data from os.name, embedded encrypted data in Fernet decryption, and external requests library.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec, network requests if os.name == 'nt'.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> requests and Fernet import -> Fernet decryption -> exec -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed during install, no visible validation or checks, suspicious long description and author info, non-descriptive package name 'Matpliotlib'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a package, with a highly obfuscated class name executing code only on Windows systems. The code imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography', decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload, and executes it via 'exec'. The encrypted data likely contains malicious code or a backdoor, executed during installation. The purpose of this execution appears to be malicious, as it is hidden and only triggered on Windows, which could be used to install malware or perform malicious actions without user awareness. The long description and author info seem intentionally obfuscated or placeholder, possibly for concealment. Overall, the malicious code is embedded directly in the install process, representing a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior via code execution of decrypted payload during installation, only on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and obfuscated structure strongly indicate malicious intent, making this package highly dangerous for use.",
