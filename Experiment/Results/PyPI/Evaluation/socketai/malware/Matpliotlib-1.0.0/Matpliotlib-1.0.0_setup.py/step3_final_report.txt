{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that, during installation on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload string, the class constructor, and the run() method which triggers decryption and execution.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing decrypted code, which could be malicious, during the setup process.",
  "flows": "The class's run() method decrypts the payload and passes it directly to exec(), executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated class name, nonsensical description strings, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution only on Windows; all signs of obfuscation and malicious concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code's core behavior involves decrypting a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload and executing it during setup, but only on Windows systems. The class name and description are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a classic malicious pattern, potentially allowing remote code execution or backdoor installation. The setup_requires including 'fernet' and 'requests' suggests dependencies for decryption and network operations, which could be used maliciously. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, assigning high malware (up to 1.0), obfuscation, and security risk scores. The consistent pattern across multiple reports confirms the malicious nature of this package.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded malicious code that decrypts and executes arbitrary payloads during installation, with obfuscation to conceal intent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor, posing a severe security threat. All evidence supports classifying this package as malicious with maximum severity scores.",
