    "The code decrypts and executes potentially malicious code during installation, which is suspicious behavior."
  ],
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when run on Windows, decrypts and executes code fetched from a hardcoded Fernet key. This decrypted code is executed directly via 'exec', which poses a significant security risk, as it can run arbitrary, potentially malicious code from an external source. The encrypted payload and the use of Fernet encryption suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent. The inclusion of remote code execution during setup is highly suspicious and indicates possible malware or backdoor behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its behavior of decrypting and executing remote code during installation on Windows systems. The malicious payload can perform unauthorized actions, making this a security risk. The obfuscation through encrypted payload and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
