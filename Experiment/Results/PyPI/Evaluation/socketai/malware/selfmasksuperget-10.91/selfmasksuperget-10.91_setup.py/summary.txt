  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and external URL suggest active malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and reflect the severity. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for definitive analysis, but current evidence warrants high suspicion and caution."
