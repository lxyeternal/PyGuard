  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, triggered by the absence of a specific file. Silent error handling and obfuscation tactics further support this. While the actual payload remains unverified without decoding, the pattern aligns with malicious supply chain behavior. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
