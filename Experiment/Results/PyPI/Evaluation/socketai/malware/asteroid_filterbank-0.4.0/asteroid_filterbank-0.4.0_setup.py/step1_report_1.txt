{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script that also performs a post-installation network request and writes to a file.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads __file__ for current path, makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org).",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), writing to 'bykotko.txt' file, base64 encoding of IP and system info.",
  "flows": "After installation, _post_install() is called, which retrieves the system's public IP, system hostname, and current path; encodes this info and sends it via GET request to an external domain, and writes 'kotko' into 'bykotko.txt'.",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated in purpose; the network requests send encoded system info to an external domain without clear user consent; the _post_install() is registered to run at exit, possibly to hide malicious activity; the use of requests.get with URL parameters containing base64-encoded data can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules, including requests for network activity. The custom install class registers _post_install() to run at program exit. The _post_install() function retrieves external IP, hostname, and current directory, encodes them, and sends them to a suspicious domain (kotko.org). It also appends 'kotko' to a file named 'bykotko.txt'. The network communication occurs during installation, which could be malicious if used for data exfiltration. The code does not contain backdoors or destructive actions, but the behavior of sending system info to an external site without user knowledge is suspicious and indicates potential data leakage or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information to an external domain during package installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. The overall structure suggests intentional data exfiltration without user awareness. It is advised to treat this package with caution.",
