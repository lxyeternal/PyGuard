{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external domains ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org') during the custom installation process.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, potentially transmitting system information (IP address, hostname, path) to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script retrieves the system's public IP, hostname, and path, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "The custom '_post_install' function collects and transmits system data to an external domain without user consent or notification. The code has commented out or redundant imports, but notably performs network requests during install.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with additional code in the '_post_install' function that sends system information to an external server. This behavior is unusual for a package installation script and suggests potential data exfiltration. The use of 'requests' during installation is a red flag. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code that directly damages the system is present. The network requests to 'api.ipify.org' and 'kotko.org' could be used for tracking or data theft. The code does not appear obfuscated but includes potentially malicious data collection routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions primarily as a package setup script but includes suspicious behavior by collecting system data and transmitting it to an external domain during installation. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent related to privacy invasion or data theft, warranting caution.",
