{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes custom installation behavior and performs network requests during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the README file, system environment (hostname, current path), and external URLs (api.ipify.org, kotko.org). It also reads and writes to a local file 'bykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends encoded data to a suspicious domain ('kotko.org') via an HTTP GET request, which could be used for data exfiltration. It also writes to a local file.",
  "flows": "Input sources include README content, system hostname, current path, and external IP. Data is encoded in base64 and sent to 'kotko.org'. Local file 'bykotko.txt' is appended with 'kotko'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests during installation, including retrieving the public IP and sending encoded data to an external domain. The URL 'kotko.org' is suspicious, and the purpose of the data exfiltration is unclear. The code also writes to a local file without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup.py configuration for a Python package, but it includes a custom install class that registers a post-installation function. This function ('_post_install') executes during package installation, performing two actions: writing 'kotko' to 'bykotko.txt' and sending the public IP, hostname, and path (encoded in base64) to 'kotko.org'. These behaviors are unusual for a standard setup script. The external request to retrieve the IP address and the subsequent transmission of this data to a suspicious domain suggest malicious intent or data exfiltration. The code does not appear to have any legitimate purpose related to package installation or configuration beyond these network actions. The use of base64 encoding may be an attempt to obfuscate the data. No other malicious behaviors such as executing system commands, installing backdoors, or damaging files are present. The code's primary suspicious aspect is the automated transmission of environment and system data to an external domain during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably sending encoded system and environment information to a suspicious external domain during installation. This suggests an intent to exfiltrate user data or perform unauthorized tracking. It is highly recommended to avoid using this package.",
