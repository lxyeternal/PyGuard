{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, primarily used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation behavior, with some custom post-install actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for description, reads the current file's path, and makes HTTP requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org) during post-install.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (IP fetching and data exfiltration), writing to a local file ('bykotko.txt'), base64 encoding data, and sending encoded data to a suspicious domain (kotko.org).",
  "flows": "During package installation (via 'new_install'), the _post_install function executes, which fetches the system's public IP, gathers hostname and path, encodes this info, and transmits it to 'kotko.org'. It also writes 'kotko' to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install function performs network requests to fetch IP and send data to an external server without user consent, writes to a local file, and encodes data in base64 before transmission. The code is designed to run during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard modules for package configuration and includes a custom install class that registers a post-install function. The post-install function (_post_install) retrieves the system's public IP address, hostname, and current directory path, encodes this information, and sends it to a suspicious domain 'kotko.org'. It also appends the string 'kotko' to a local file named 'bykotko.txt'. These actions are executed automatically during package installation, without any user intervention or obvious necessity. The external network activity and data exfiltration are indicative of malicious behavior, potentially used for tracking, system fingerprinting, or unauthorized data collection. The code does not appear to be obfuscated, but the malicious intent is evident in the data harvesting and communication to a suspicious domain.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, with automatic data exfiltration to a suspicious domain during package installation. This indicates an intentional attempt to collect system information and transmit it covertly. The package's main purpose appears to be legitimate packaging, but it is compromised with malicious post-install actions.",
