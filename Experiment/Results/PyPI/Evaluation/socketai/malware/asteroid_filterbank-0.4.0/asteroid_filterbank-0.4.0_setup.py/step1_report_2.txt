{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and distribute a Python package named 'asteroid_filterbank' via setuptools, with custom installation behavior that includes performing network requests and writing to a file during post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and within the _post_install() function, it makes HTTP GET requests to external services (https://api.ipify.org and https://kotko.org), reads system information (os.uname()), and reads the current file path.",
  "sinks": "The code performs network requests that send data (IP address, hostname, path) to an external server (kotko.org), which could be used to exfiltrate information. It writes to a local file 'bykotko.txt' and encodes data in base64 before transmission.",
  "flows": "Source: reading README.md and system info; Destination: network request to kotko.org with base64-encoded data; File write operation to 'bykotko.txt'; Embedded within the custom install class's post-install hook.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install() function is registered during the custom installation process and performs network communication to an external domain, sending system information and encoding it in base64. The URL 'https://kotko.org' appears suspicious and could be malicious or tracking. The 'bykotko.txt' file is created and appended to without clear purpose. These behaviors are unusual for a typical package setup.",
  "analysis": "The setup script primarily configures package metadata and dependencies. The notable suspicious behavior is in the _post_install() function, which executes during installation via the custom 'install' command. It collects system info (public IP, hostname, path), encodes this data, and sends it to an external server. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking, which is malicious. No other malicious code, such as backdoors, code injection, or harmful payloads, is evident. The use of external requests and data encoding during setup is a significant security concern, especially since it operates automatically during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup procedures but includes a hidden and malicious-looking data exfiltration mechanism within the post-install hook. The external communication to an untrusted domain and collection of system info without user consent indicates malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to this behavior, and the package should be considered unsafe for installation.",
