  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'toolproof' Python package, including an obfuscated subprocess call.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call with encoded command executed if 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that executes a PowerShell command with encoded payload.",
  "flows": "Check if 'tahg' exists -> If not, run encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command in subprocess call, conditional execution based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing setup utilities and then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists; if not, it executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The PowerShell command is encoded, likely to conceal malicious intent or payload. Following that, it runs a setup function to install 'modlib' with metadata, wrapped in a try-except block, suppressing errors. The obfuscated PowerShell command and the conditional execution strongly suggest an attempt to run hidden, potentially malicious code without user awareness. The setup portion appears standard but is obscured by the prior code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, which indicates malicious intent or sabotage. The setup process itself looks legitimate but is preceded by covert code execution, raising security concerns.",
