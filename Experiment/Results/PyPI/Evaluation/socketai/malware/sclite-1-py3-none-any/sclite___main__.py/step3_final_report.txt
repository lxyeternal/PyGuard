{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Discord, browsers, and Roblox, with capabilities for injecting scripts, disabling protections, self-hiding, and exfiltrating data via webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser storage files (leveldb, sqlite), registry entries, environment variables, local storage, and system info endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhook, writing to files, executing scripts, process termination, self-hiding via Windows API, zipping and uploading data.",
  "flows": "Reads tokens/passwords/cookies from local files and registry, decrypts data, injects scripts into Discord directories, kills processes, exfiltrates data via webhook, and self-hides.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook and injection URLs, use of string replacements for obfuscation, minimal comments, broad exception suppression, self-hiding, process killing, disabling protections.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive malicious activities including credential theft, process termination, script injection, data exfiltration, and self-hiding. It employs obfuscation tactics such as string replacements and minimal comments, but not heavy encryption or complex obfuscation. It interacts with system files, registry, and network to gather and exfiltrate sensitive data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, risk: 1, obfuscation: ~0.3-0.8) are consistent with these behaviors. The code's intent and actions are clearly malicious, with high confidence in these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious, multi-faceted info stealer with injection, persistence, and evasion techniques. All reports accurately identify its malicious nature and assign appropriate high scores. The overall threat level is maximum, and the code should be considered dangerous malware.",
