{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for harvesting sensitive user information including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox credentials, then exfiltrating this data via a webhook. It also manipulates Discord and browser data, potentially injecting malicious scripts into Discord clients and disabling security protections.",
  "sources": "Reads from local app data directories for Discord, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and other browsers; reads environment variables; reads local State files for encrypted data; reads files with extension .log, .ldb, and .sqlite; accesses registry for Roblox cookies; makes network requests to Discord API and IP info service.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data through HTTP POST requests to a specified Discord webhook; writes data to local files; executes injected JavaScript files; kills processes; copies itself to startup folder; deletes files and directories; creates ZIP archives for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Collects tokens, cookies, passwords from browser databases; decrypts data using master keys; collects environment info; assembles data into formatted messages; exfiltrates via webhook; injects malicious scripts into Discord installations; deletes local artifacts; archives data and uploads it.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; presence of multiple methods for stealing tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox credentials; code injection into Discord; self-hiding and startup persistence; disabling security measures; extensive use of try/except blocks to avoid detection; suspicious file and directory manipulations; obfuscated or unusual strings (e.g., replacing spaces with special characters in output); unprompted self-deletion of temporary files and directories; complex, non-standard flow for data collection and exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Discord, browsers, and Roblox. It decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens from leveldb files, cookies, and other data, then sends all information to a remote webhook. It injects scripts into Discord clients, disables security measures like DiscordTokenProtector and BetterDiscord, and can hide itself and persist across reboots. It also collects system info and location data for contextual information. The code uses multiple techniques to avoid detection, including exception handling, self-deletion, and hiding. Overall, the behavior aligns with typical malware, specifically info-stealing malware, with additional functionalities to disable security tools and inject malicious scripts into legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info for malicious purposes. It also disables security protections and injects malicious scripts into Discord clients, indicating intent to maintain persistence and maximize data extraction. The presence of hardcoded webhook, self-hiding, and process-killing routines further confirm its harmful nature.",
