{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies from the user's system, and then send this data along with system information to a specified webhook. It also injects code into Discord processes, terminates Discord-related processes, and hides itself from the system, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "File reads for Local Storage and leveldb files, SQLite database queries for Chrome passwords and cookies, environment variables, process enumerations, and network requests for IP info and Discord API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to webhook URLs for data exfiltration, file write operations for storing extracted credentials, process termination commands, and self-modification/hiding actions such as setting file attributes and copying itself to startup folders.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, cookies, passwords -> stores in local files -> reads system info and IP details -> constructs a detailed report -> exfiltrates data via HTTP POST to webhook, including zipping collected files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded webhook URL, code injecting scripts into Discord, terminating Discord processes, disabling protections, and self-hiding behavior. The code also attempts to disable Discord protections, injects code into Discord, and automatically runs at startup, all typical of malware.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a credential stealer and system info logger, combining multiple data extraction methods targeting browsers, Discord, Roblox, and system details. It performs self-concealment, disables security features, and exfiltrates data to an external server. The presence of hardcoded webhook, code injection, process termination, and self-hiding behaviors are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code operates stealthily, combining credential theft, process manipulation, and data exfiltration, consistent with malicious malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, primarily aimed at stealing user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information, then exfiltrating this data to an attacker-controlled webhook. Its self-concealment, code injection, and process-killing functionalities confirm its malicious purpose. Overall, it poses a high security threat and should be considered malware.",
