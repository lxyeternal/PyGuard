{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract various sensitive information from the user's system, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, Roblox cookies, and system information, and then exfiltrate this data to a specified Discord webhook. It also injects scripts into Discord installations and can kill Discord processes, hide itself, and set itself to run on startup, indicating malicious intent aimed at data theft and persistence.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading local files such as Chrome's 'Local State', 'Login Data', 'Cookies', leveldb files from browsers and Discord, as well as environment variables and system commands (PowerShell, subprocess). It also reads process lists and system info from APIs and the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via HTTP POST requests to the configured Discord webhook, including sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and files (zipped logs and data). The script writes decrypted passwords and cookies to local files before exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (browser files, system environment, process info, network states), is decrypted or extracted, collected into reports, and then exfiltrated through HTTP requests to the webhook. Files are zipped locally before sending. Injection scripts are fetched from a remote URL and written into Discord directories.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated strings, such as replacing spaces with Unicode characters, and uses 'replace' on strings to hide the nature of messages. It writes self-attributes like 'Grabber By' signatures in files and reports. The presence of injection and process-killing routines, self-hiding, persistence mechanisms, and extensive data exfiltration routines strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also modifies system files (BetterDiscord, Discord processes) and disables security tools (DiscordTokenProtector). It attempts to hide itself using Windows API and sets itself to run at startup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Discord and browser credentials. It reads sensitive data from local files, decrypts passwords and cookies, extracts tokens via regex and decryption, and also attempts to extract Roblox cookies via registry queries. It performs process manipulation such as killing Discord processes, injecting scripts into Discord installations, and hiding itself. It collects system info, geolocation, and user data, then packages and exfiltrates the data to a webhook. It also modifies Discord-related files and attempts persistence. The code obfuscates some strings and uses indirect string replacements to hide intent. All behaviors align with typical malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at stealing user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information, injecting malicious scripts into Discord, disabling security measures, and maintaining persistence. Its actions are consistent with a malicious data exfiltration and system compromise tool, indicating high malicious intent.",
