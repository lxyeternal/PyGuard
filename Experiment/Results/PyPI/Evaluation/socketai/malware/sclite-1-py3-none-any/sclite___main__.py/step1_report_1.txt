{
  "purpose": "The code is designed as a malicious token and password stealer targeting Discord, Roblox, and browser credentials, with capabilities for self-hiding, persistence, injecting scripts into Discord, and exfiltrating data to a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from browser storage (leveldb, sqlite files), Discord local storage, environment variables, and Windows registry via PowerShell commands; reads process info and system data; fetches injection scripts over HTTP.",
  "sinks": "Sends exfiltrated tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info via HTTP POST to a webhook; writes malicious injection scripts to Discord directories; creates ZIP archives of stolen data; kills Discord processes.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens and credentials from local files and registry → decrypts sensitive data → stores and formats data → exfiltrates via webhook → injects malicious scripts into Discord → terminates processes if configured → self-hides and persists → zips and sends all collected data.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded webhook URL, injection URL, and base64-encoded encrypted data. Implements self-hiding, persistence, process termination, and script injection. Uses cryptographic and system-specific techniques to steal data covertly. The code structure is obfuscated with misleading variable names and complex logic. Has no comments and employs aggressive exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive info stealer and malware dropper. It gathers Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, browser passwords and cookies, and system info. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows cryptography APIs. It injects JavaScript into Discord processes, potentially for malicious overlays or remote control. It self-hides by setting file attributes and copies itself to startup directories. It kills Discord processes to disable security or debugging tools. It archives all collected data into a ZIP and sends it via a webhook, including system info and IP geolocation. The code structure, obfuscation tactics, and malicious behaviors strongly suggest intent to compromise user data and privacy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to harvest sensitive data from users and exfiltrate it stealthily. It uses several techniques for persistence, obfuscation, and evasion. Given its capabilities and intent, it poses a high security risk and should not be used or trusted.",
