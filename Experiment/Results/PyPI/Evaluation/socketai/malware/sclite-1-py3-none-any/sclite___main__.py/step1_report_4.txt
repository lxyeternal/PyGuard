{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to extract sensitive data such as Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, passwords, and cookies from browsers and other applications, then exfiltrate the collected information along with system details to a specified webhook, while also injecting malicious code into Discord-related applications.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local storage files, SQLite databases, and Windows registry entries for tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, writes files to disk, executes system commands, and injects code into Discord application directories.",
  "flows": "Collects tokens, cookies, passwords, system info → exfiltrates data via webhook and file uploads → injects malicious script into Discord applications → deletes traces and self-hides.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded webhook URL, injection URL, and other configuration parameters. Uses obfuscated strings and comments. Performs malicious activities such as killing processes, injecting code, stealing credentials, and exfiltrating system info. The code structure is complex and includes functions that bypass protections, hide files, and run in the background without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: it extracts tokens from various applications, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, and collects system information. It also injects JavaScript into Discord processes and attempts to hide its presence by hiding files and copying itself to startup directories. The code exfiltrates all gathered data through a webhook, including files zipped together. It bypasses Discord protections and modifies Discord's internal files, indicating malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded webhook and injection URLs, along with system modification tactics, confirms malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscation tactics like string replacement and minimal comments, making analysis challenging. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious intent with multiple dangerous actions, including data theft, process manipulation, and system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive malicious payload designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data, manipulate system and application files, and maintain persistence. It demonstrates clear malicious intent through data theft, process killing, code injection, and self-hiding techniques, posing a significant security threat.",
