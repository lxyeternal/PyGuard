{
  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function that prints a static message, serving as a non-malicious example.",
  "sources": "The function 'hello()' which outputs a fixed string; no external data inputs or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "The function executes directly, with no data flow from external sources to sinks; it simply prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a static message. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security concerns. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static demonstration with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
