{
  "purpose": "Collect and send system and package information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname() - these functions read system environment, user info, current working directory, and hostname.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() - sends data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (user, cwd, hostname) -> data packaged in JSON -> sink (requests.post).",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally posts system information to an external server without any user consent prompts, and the target URL (https://0v0.in/pypi/) appears suspicious and potentially malicious, possibly used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules to gather user name, current directory, and hostname. It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a potentially suspicious domain. There are no obfuscations, no hidden code, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose seems to be gathering system info for unknown reasons, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection. The URL domain looks suspicious and untrusted, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information to a remote server without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be part of a tracking or data theft activity.",
