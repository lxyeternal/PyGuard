  "purpose": "Collects environment information (user, current working directory, hostname) and sends it via POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL",
  "flows": "Source functions provide data that flows into the JSON payload sent by requests.post()",
  "anomalies": "No user prompt before data exfiltration, URL is suspicious, no obfuscation or malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects environment data and transmits it to an external server without obfuscation or malicious payloads. It does not perform code injection, system modification, or malicious actions. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential privacy invasion. The code is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent beyond data collection. The behavior is privacy-invasive but not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unprompted collection and exfiltration of environment data to a suspicious URL, raising privacy concerns. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or malicious intent. The malware score should be zero, but the privacy invasion warrants a moderate to high security risk score. Overall, the code is not malicious but should be treated with caution due to privacy implications.",
