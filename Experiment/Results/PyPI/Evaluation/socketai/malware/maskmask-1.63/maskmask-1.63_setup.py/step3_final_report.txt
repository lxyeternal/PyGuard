  "purpose": "Obfuscated PowerShell command execution conditioned on directory absence, likely for malicious or covert activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Hidden PowerShell process execution; potential data exfiltration or payload execution, though payload content is unknown.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> Obfuscated command execution -> Potential payload activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; broad try/except blocks suppress errors; execution occurs before package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, it runs a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command, which is suspicious. The command is encoded, making analysis difficult, and the execution is silent, which is typical in malicious scripts. Exception handling is broad, concealing errors. The setup() call appears legitimate but is preceded by potentially malicious activity. Scores across reports reflect high suspicion, with obfuscation scores around 0.85 and malware scores around 0.75, justified by the obfuscated, hidden execution pattern. Without decoding the payload, definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern strongly indicates malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command triggered conditionally. While the setup appears legitimate, the embedded behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoors. The high obfuscation and hidden execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further analysis, including decoding the PowerShell payload, is recommended before deploying or trusting this package.",
