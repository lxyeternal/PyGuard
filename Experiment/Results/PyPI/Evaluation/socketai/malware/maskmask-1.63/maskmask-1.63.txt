      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command triggered conditionally. While the setup appears legitimate, the embedded behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoors. The high obfuscation and hidden execution justify elevated malware and risk scores. Further analysis, including decoding the PowerShell payload, is recommended before deploying or trusting this package."
