{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts and executes a payload during installation on Windows, employing obfuscation and encrypted code to conceal malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Encrypted payload string, os.name check, import statements for requests and Fernet, hardcoded decryption key.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code.",
  "flows": "On Windows, import requests and Fernet -> decrypt payload with hardcoded key -> execute decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload, obfuscated variable names, nonsensical long strings, code execution during setup, conditional on OS.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with a static key and executes it via exec(). The code employs obfuscation through nonsensical variable names and encrypted strings, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The payload is not visible, but its decryption and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious activity, such as installing backdoors, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The high reliance on obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and runtime code execution are classic indicators of malware. The package metadata and name appear nonsensical, further supporting suspicion. Given these factors, the overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware likelihood is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, employing obfuscation to hide its intent. This pattern aligns with known malicious package tactics, indicating a high probability of malicious activity and system risk.",
