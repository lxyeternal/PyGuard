{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that executes encrypted code during installation, specifically on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from environment variables, import statements, and decrypts data for execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code using exec(), importing modules like requests and fernet, and potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Decrypted Fernet data is executed directly via exec() during install on Windows, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; the code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical variable names and long strings; the long description appears as random data; the setup class modifies install behavior to run potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it via exec(). This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code during installation can lead to arbitrary malicious activity. The encrypted payload is not shown plainly, but its use indicates potential malicious intent. The code employs obfuscation through nonsensical variable names, long strings, and indirect execution. The presence of encrypted payloads that are decrypted and executed at install time strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or malware. Overall, the code's structure, decryption and execution pattern, and obfuscation indicate a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows systems, which can lead to malicious activities such as backdoor installation or system compromise. The obfuscation and execution patterns are typical of malicious packages designed to hide harmful intent.",
