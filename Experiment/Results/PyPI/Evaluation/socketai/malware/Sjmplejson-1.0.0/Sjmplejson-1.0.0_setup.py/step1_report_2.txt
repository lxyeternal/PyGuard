  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports (setuptools, os), environment checks (os.name), embedded encrypted payload, package metadata.",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decrypted code execution.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypts payload -> executes code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted payload, encrypted embedded code, obfuscated variable names, unusual long description content, and a suspicious setup class method name that resembles random string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a package named 'Sjmplejson' with non-descriptive, obfuscated metadata. It contains a custom install class that, on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded encrypted code via Fernet. The payload is hidden, and executing arbitrary code through exec() with decrypted content is highly suspicious, potentially malicious. The code's obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution constitute significant security risks. The inclusion of remote requests and cryptography without clear purpose further raises concerns about malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes encrypted code during installation on Windows, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior or backdoor functionality. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical of malicious packages aiming to hide harmful actions.",
