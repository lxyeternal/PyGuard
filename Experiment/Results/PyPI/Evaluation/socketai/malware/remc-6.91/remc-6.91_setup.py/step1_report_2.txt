  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'remc' Python package, including some obfuscated code execution.",

  "flows": "os.path.exists check -> subprocess.Popen executes encoded command if condition met",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated encoded PowerShell command, conditional execution, silent subprocess launch",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup functions and then attempts to run an encoded PowerShell command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist. The command is encoded in base64, likely to obscure its intent, and is executed with a hidden window. The setup function defines package metadata for 'remc'. The use of obfuscated code and silent process execution are suspicious, indicating possible malicious intent, such as covert data exfiltration or remote control, although the payload's specific behavior cannot be directly determined from the encoding alone. The script is designed to silently execute potentially malicious code without raising suspicion. No other suspicious library usage or hardcoded credentials are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated PowerShell code that executes silently, which is suspicious. It appears intended to perform covert actions during setup, raising security concerns. The overall behavior suggests possible malicious intent, although the exact payload is not clear without decoding.",
