      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression suggest malicious intent, warranting high security concern. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms its purpose."
