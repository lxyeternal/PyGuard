      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of malicious intent primarily due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command and suspicious URL comment. While the setup process appears legitimate, the pre-setup payload behavior is highly suspicious and warrants further decoding and analysis to confirm malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and should be treated with caution."
