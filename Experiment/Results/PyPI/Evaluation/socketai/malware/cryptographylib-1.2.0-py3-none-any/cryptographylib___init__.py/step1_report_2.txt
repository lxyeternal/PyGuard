{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration, including stealing browser data, cookies, passwords, tokens, screenshots, system info, and potentially other sensitive data, then uploading it to external servers. It also includes functions for collecting various user information and injecting or modifying browser data and Discord client behavior.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., COMUPTERNAME, APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP), clipboard data, browser data files (e.g., Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), system commands, and external requests to IP info and Discord APIs. It reads files from browser directories, registry entries, and local system files.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to specified webhook URLs, and files are uploaded to external sites (transfer.sh, anonfiles). There are functions that send system info, tokens, passwords, cookies, and collected files to remote servers. There are also file creation, deletion, and zipping operations, often followed by uploads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, clipboard content, browser databases, and system info are collected; then, data is decrypted, formatted, and uploaded via HTTP POST to external URLs, often after being saved temporarily in files or ZIP archives. This includes the collection of browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and screenshots, which are then exfiltrated through webhook posts or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes webhook URLs, includes extensive data collection from multiple browsers, Discord tokens, and system info, and employs obfuscated or convoluted functions for decryption and process termination. It kills processes related to debugging or analysis, forcibly terminates processes like Chrome, and deletes or manipulates browser data. Also, the code makes suspicious requests to external IP info and pastebin-like services, and it attempts to hide or restart itself via startup folder modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious data stealer, targeting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and screenshots, then exfiltrating them via webhooks and file uploads. It uses multiple techniques to decrypt stored passwords and cookies, gather system identifiers, and intercept clipboard data for cryptocurrency addresses. It actively kills security or debugging processes, manipulates browser data files, and uploads sensitive information, indicating malicious intent. The code's complexity, process termination methods, and data exfiltration mechanisms strongly suggest malicious behavior. No legitimate security or maintenance purpose is evident; all operations are aligned with stealthy information theft and potential sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior focused on stealing sensitive user data, system info, and tokens, then exfiltrating this data to external servers. It also includes anti-debugging measures, process killing, and file manipulation, confirming its intent for unauthorized surveillance and data theft. It is clearly malicious with high confidence and poses a significant security threat.",
