{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activities such as data theft, credential extraction, token harvesting, system information gathering, and exfiltration via webhooks and file uploads. It collects sensitive data from browsers, Discord tokens, system info, screenshots, and more, then reports it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), reading local browser storage and configuration files, clipboard content, process enumeration, registry queries, and system commands.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs (e.g., kekwltd.ru, transfer.sh), file writes, ZIP file creation, clipboard manipulation, and process termination commands. Data exfiltration occurs through network requests and file uploads.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as system info, browser data, clipboard, tokens, and files are collected by various functions. Data is then decrypted, processed, and sent via HTTP requests or uploaded files. The code kills processes, modifies registry entries, and runs background threads to persist and operate stealthily.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive obfuscation-like structure, multiple system and browser data extraction routines, process-killing commands, suspicious URL patterns, and extensive use of threading for stealth. Also, presence of functions that delete or modify system files, registry entries, and registry keys suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured with multiple classes and functions that gather system data, browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and screenshots. It exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads. The presence of hardcoded URLs, registry queries for VM detection, process termination of security tools, and extensive data collection routines are typical in malware or spyware designed for credential theft, privacy invasion, and system sabotage. The code’s logic strongly indicates malicious intent due to data theft, persistence techniques, and obfuscation of network endpoints and functions.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious, performing comprehensive system and browser data extraction, credential harvesting, and information exfiltration. It contains indicators of malware such as hardcoded C2 URLs, process termination, system info gathering, and extensive data collection routines. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should not be used.",
