{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, and system information from the user's machine, and then exfiltrate this data via webhooks or upload to file hosting services. It also appears to include functionalities for collecting browser and system info, capturing screenshots, and searching for specific files related to passwords or wallets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from various browser storage locations (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Edge), system environment variables, process lists, and user files in common directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. It also reads local state files for decryption keys and configuration files for tokens and other secrets.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a specified webhook URL or uploaded to external file hosting services. It also writes to local files, deletes and manipulates system processes, and terminates security or anti-malware processes.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from browser databases, system info, user files, and environment variables are collected (sources), then decrypted if necessary, stored temporarily, and finally sent over network requests or uploaded as files (sinks). The flow includes decryption of stored credentials, gathering tokens, and exfiltration through webhooks or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive data collection including system info, browser data, and credentials, and process termination commands targeting security tools. It bypasses certain protections and disables or deletes files related to security or anti-debugging. Use of obfuscated or misleading variable names, inclusion of many suspicious browser and process names, and malicious file searches in user directories further indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code performs environment reconnaissance, including system and network info collection, decrypts stored browser passwords and cookies, collects tokens from various browsers and potentially Discord, Roblox, and other applications, and exfiltrates all gathered data via webhooks or uploads files to external servers. It terminates security-related processes, modifies or disables security tools, and creates startup entries for persistence. The code also searches user directories for specific files indicative of sensitive information, and zips up collected data before uploading. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, active process killing, and extensive data theft functions strongly suggest malicious intent. The code is well-structured but obfuscated with multiple layers of nested functions and redundant error handling, indicating attempts to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through extensive data theft, system manipulation, process termination, and exfiltration techniques. It is designed to compromise user privacy and security by stealing credentials, tokens, and system info, and then sending this data to attacker-controlled endpoints. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score indicates a high probability of malicious intent.",
