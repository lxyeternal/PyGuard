      "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious, potentially malicious behavior through hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during package setup. The embedded URL and stealthy execution reinforce high malware and security risk scores. While definitive confirmation requires decoding the payload, current evidence strongly suggests malicious intent, aligning with the high scores and warnings in the reports."
