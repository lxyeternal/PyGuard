  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration and potentially execute hidden malicious commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of the 'tahg' directory; executing subprocess with encoded command if directory does not exist.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call with encoded PowerShell command, which could be malicious; no other clear untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> If absent, execute encoded PowerShell command -> Proceed with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command with hidden window; attempt to run potentially malicious code silently; lack of error handling transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to check for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is hidden from the user and runs with a hidden window. This is suspicious, as such behavior can be used to conceal malicious activity. The setup() function is called afterward to define package parameters, which is normal. The use of try-except blocks without handling errors further obscures the behavior, making it difficult to detect failures or issues. The encoded PowerShell command could be used to download, execute, or perform malicious actions stealthily. No other obvious malicious code or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command triggered if a directory does not exist. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious activity or backdoor setup. The package setup appears normal but is potentially used as a vector for executing concealed malicious payloads.",
