  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload silently during package setup, likely to download or run malicious code. The suspicious URL, obfuscation, and silent error handling strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and flagged for further review or removal."
