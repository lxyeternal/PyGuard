{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pymaniac' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within setup() (package name, version, author, email, description, URL, license, dependencies, classifiers). No input or external data sources are read during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines static metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard package setup code. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads the long description from 'README.md', which is typical for Python package setup scripts. All data are static and intended for package distribution. There are no code execution, data input, or external network interactions. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It merely declares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
