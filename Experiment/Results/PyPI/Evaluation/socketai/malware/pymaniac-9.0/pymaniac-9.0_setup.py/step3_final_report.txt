  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports from setuptools; no untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that declares package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a local README file for description, which is standard. Dependencies are common libraries with no signs of malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input are present. The code structure is simple and transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The use of open('README.md').read() is standard practice and not inherently risky. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 (negligible). No further action is necessary.",
