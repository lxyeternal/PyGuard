  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing a Python module named 'pymaniac'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; reads static package information for setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The dependencies listed are common packages without suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, and then defines package metadata including name, version, author info, description, long description from a local file, URL, license, packages, required dependencies, and classifiers. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input. All dependencies are typical and do not appear malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard and benign setup configuration for a Python package with no detectable malicious intent or security risks.",
