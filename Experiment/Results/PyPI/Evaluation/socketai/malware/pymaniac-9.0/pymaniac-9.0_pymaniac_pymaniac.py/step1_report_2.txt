    "Extensive exfiltration of potentially sensitive data (wallets, session files, screenshots) without user consent",
    "Use of broad exception handling (try/except: pass) which suppresses errors and could hide malicious intent",
    "Automated data collection and upload process triggered on script execution without user interaction",

    "Capturing and uploading Telegram session files, potentially allowing session hijacking",
    "Gathering system info and user activity screenshots for surveillance"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple actions indicative of malicious behavior: it collects system and user data, including geolocation, IP, wallet info, and screenshots; compresses and exfiltrates sensitive files such as Telegram sessions and wallet configurations to a Telegram bot-controlled chat. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the focus on cryptocurrency wallets suggest targeted credential theft. The code is structured to run autonomously, silently exfiltrating data. No obfuscation is present, but the purposeful collection and transmission of sensitive information point toward malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential and data exfiltration malware targeting cryptocurrency wallet data, session files, and system info, sending this data to a Telegram chat. The presence of hardcoded tokens, collection of session files, and stealthy upload mechanisms confirm malicious intent.",
