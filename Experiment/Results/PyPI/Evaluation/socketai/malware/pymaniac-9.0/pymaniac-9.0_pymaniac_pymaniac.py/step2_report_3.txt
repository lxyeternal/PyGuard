  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Collects user info, system details, wallet data, session files, and exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Identifies malicious intent, exfiltration of sensitive data, hardcoded token, stealthy operation.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report accurately captures the core malicious behavior. The code indeed collects wallet files, session data, system info, and exfiltrates via Telegram with a hardcoded token. No obfuscation is present. The reasoning aligns with the code. The high malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data collection, including IP, geolocation, wallet extensions, session files, screenshots.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms malicious intent, targeted data theft, stealthy operation, hardcoded credentials.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report also correctly identifies the malicious pattern: collection of wallet/session data, geolocation, and exfiltration via Telegram. The code's behavior matches the description. The high scores are justified. No obfuscation is observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Collects user info, wallet files, browser extensions, session data, and exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Malicious behavior, stealthy data theft, hardcoded tokens, targeted data collection.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, securityRisk=0.9, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly notes the targeted collection of wallet/session data, geolocation, and Telegram exfiltration. The code operates covertly, with no obfuscation, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar collection of sensitive data, including wallet files, session files, screenshots, IP info.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Malicious behavior, stealthy exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, targeted data theft.\n- **Scores:** malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly interprets the code's behavior: stealthy collection and exfiltration of wallet/session data, system info, with hardcoded Telegram credentials. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Collects wallet data, session files, screenshots, geolocation, and exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Malicious, covert data theft, no obfuscation, high security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.9, securityRisk=0.9, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile the behavior is clearly malicious, the malware score is slightly below 1. Given the code's clear exfiltration and targeted data collection, I believe a malware score of 0.9 is slightly conservative but acceptable considering no advanced obfuscation or reverse shell techniques are present. The security risk is high due to the sensitive data involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** The code is unequivocally malicious—stealthy data collection, exfiltration of wallet/session data, use of hardcoded credentials, and automation suggest malicious intent. I would assign a **malware score of 1** for the overall assessment.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques observed. I agree with a **0** here.\n  \n- **Security Risk Score:** The behavior poses a severe security threat—exfiltration of sensitive wallet and session data, system info, and screenshots. I would rate this as **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 1            | Clear exfiltration, hardcoded tokens, targeted data theft  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | No obfuscation techniques present                            |\n| Security Risk    | 1            | High risk due to sensitive data exfiltration and stealthiness |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. My estimates align with their reasoning, with the exception of slightly raising the malware score to 1 for the overall malicious nature.",
