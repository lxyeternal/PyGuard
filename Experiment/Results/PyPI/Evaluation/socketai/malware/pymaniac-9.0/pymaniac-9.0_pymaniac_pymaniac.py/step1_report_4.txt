{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect sensitive user data, including wallet information, browser extension data, IP address, country, and Telegram session data, then exfiltrate this data via Telegram's API.",
  "sources": "User input includes the IP address retrieved from 'https://api.ipify.org' and the system username from getpass.getuser(). Data is read from the filesystem (Exodus wallet files, Telegram session data, browser extensions).",
  "sinks": "The data is sent through HTTP POST requests to Telegram's API endpoints, uploading files (wallet info, session data, screenshots). Files are created locally in temp directories before transfer.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data (IP, country, ISP, wallet files, session files, screenshot) is collected from sources, stored temporarily, then transmitted via HTTP POST to Telegram's API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs automatic data collection without user consent, including cryptocurrency wallet files, browser session data, and screenshots containing user information. The use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID indicates command and control. The code attempts to hide its operations via obfuscation-like patterns and uses multiple libraries for automation (pyautogui), file manipulation, and network requests.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for specific browser extensions and wallet files, then zips and sends these files to a Telegram chat. It captures a screenshot with user details and system info. The code uses hardcoded credentials and API keys, and automates sensitive data exfiltration. No user interaction or warning prompts are present. The structure indicates an intent to stealthily gather and transmit user data, including cryptocurrency wallets and session info, which can be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by stealthily collecting sensitive user data, including wallet files, session data, and system info, then exfiltrating this data via Telegram. The use of hardcoded API tokens, unsolicited screenshots, and automated file uploads strongly suggests intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
