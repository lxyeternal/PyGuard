{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect user information, including IP address, country, ISP, and specific files related to cryptocurrency wallets (Exodus, MetaMask, Ledger). It then uploads this data and screenshots to a Telegram chat, possibly for malicious surveillance or data theft.",
  "sources": "Reads user environment variables, file system directories (Exodus, Telegram, Ledger, Chrome extensions), user input via getpass, external IP and geolocation via HTTP requests, and screenshots via pyautogui.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data, screenshots, and session files to a Telegram chat via HTTP POST requests, and deletes local files afterward. It also copies and zips potentially sensitive wallet files.",
  "flows": "Sources of user data and wallet files flow into compression, screenshot capture, and session file zipping functions, then flow into HTTP requests to send data to Telegram, followed by cleanup actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID embedded in code. The script collects and uploads sensitive wallet data, session files, and screenshots without user consent. Uses broad exception handling which masks errors, and automatically exits after execution, indicating stealthy operation. The code reads specific wallet extensions and directories, indicating targeted data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules and setting paths to user directories. It collects environment info (IP, country, ISP) and checks for specific browser extensions and wallet files, suggesting targeted data harvesting. It then defines functions to zip wallet data, capture screenshots, and send these via Telegram. The main function, 'pymaniac', orchestrates these steps, automating the collection and exfiltration process. The hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID, along with the targeted directories, indicate malicious intent to stealthily extract and transmit user data, including wallet information, session files, and screenshots. The code's structure, with broad exception handling and automated exit, supports covert data exfiltration without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior, primarily aimed at clandestine data theft of cryptocurrency wallet files, session data, and user information, exfiltrated via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded credentials, targeted data collection, and automated data transmission strongly suggest it is malicious malware designed for surveillance and theft.",
