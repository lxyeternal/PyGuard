{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, wallet files, session data, and screenshots, then exfiltrates this sensitive information via Telegram API, aiming at cryptocurrency wallet theft and session hijacking.",
  "sources": "IP address fetch from api.ipify.org, geolocation via ip-api.com, wallet extension directories, session files in Telegram tdata, user input via getpass, environment variables, and filesystem checks for wallet and ledger files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Telegram's sendDocument and sendPhoto endpoints, filesystem operations including copying, zipping, and deleting wallet/session files and screenshots.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources (IP, geolocation, wallet/session files, screenshots), stored temporarily, then transmitted via Telegram API calls, followed by cleanup of local files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, broad exception handling suppressing errors, silent exfiltration without user consent, targeted detection of wallet extensions and files, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: collecting IP, geolocation, wallet extension presence, session files, and screenshots; then exfiltrates this data covertly via Telegram API. It uses hardcoded credentials, operates silently, and targets sensitive user data, indicating clear malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or evasion techniques. The broad exception handling could hide failures but does not affect the malicious nature. The exfiltration of wallet and session files, along with system info, confirms its role as a credential and data theft trojan.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for covert data theft and exfiltration of sensitive cryptocurrency wallet and session data via Telegram. It operates stealthily, with hardcoded credentials and targeted data collection, posing a high security risk. The scores are consistent with its behavior, warranting a malware score of 1, a security risk of 1, and an obfuscation score of 0.",
