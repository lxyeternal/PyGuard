  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims, the logic, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code **collects IP, geolocation, ISP info** — clearly data gathering.\n- It **checks for specific wallet extensions and files** (MetaMask, Exodus, Ledger).\n- It **captures screenshots**.\n- It **zips and exfiltrates wallet/session files** via Telegram API.\n- It **uses a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID**.\n- It **performs automated, silent exfiltration** without user consent.\n- The **behavior is stealthy, targeting sensitive data**.\n- No obfuscation is present; code is relatively straightforward.\n- The code is **malicious**, aiming at data theft.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes data collection, including IP, geolocation, wallet extensions, and session files.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly identifies Telegram API POST requests and filesystem modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded token, broad exception handling, silent operation, and targeted wallet detection.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately labels this as a **malicious data-stealing trojan**.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.** The behavior is clearly malicious, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes IP, geolocation, wallet detection, and session files.\n- **Sinks:** Accurate identification of data transmission via Telegram API.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions hardcoded token, broad exception handling, stealthy exfiltration, targeted wallet data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies as **malicious credential/data exfiltration malware**.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.** The analysis matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes collection of IP, country, ISP, wallet files, session data, and screenshots.\n- **Sinks:** Properly notes the data sent via Telegram API.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded token, targeted data collection, stealthy operation, and session file exfiltration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies malicious intent, targeting cryptocurrency data.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are justified and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes collection of user data, wallet info, browser extensions, and session files.\n- **Sinks:** Accurate about data exfiltration via Telegram API.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions hardcoded token, stealthy collection, and targeted wallet/session data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies as malicious, targeting sensitive data.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are consistent with the behavior.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes collection of wallet data, system info, screenshots.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly notes data sent via Telegram API.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights hardcoded token, silent exfiltration, and targeted data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies malicious data theft.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.9, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Note:** Slightly lower malware score (0.9) perhaps due to the absence of more advanced obfuscation or network manipulation techniques, but still very malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- The **behavior across all reports is consistently malicious**, with data collection, exfiltration, and targeted wallet/session files.\n- The **scores are generally appropriate**: malware at 1 or 0.9, security risk at 1 or 0.9, obfuscation at 0.\n- The **confidence levels (0.9)** are justified given the code's clear malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **1.0** — the code is unequivocally malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk:** **1.0** — high risk due to exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and well-justified.\n- The code is a **classic credential and data exfiltration malware** targeting cryptocurrency wallets, session files, and system info.\n- The use of hardcoded tokens and silent operation underscores malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the malicious nature of the code. The scores are appropriate; I would assign a **malware score of 1.0**, **obfuscated at 0**, and **security risk at 1.0** for an overall high-severity threat.",
