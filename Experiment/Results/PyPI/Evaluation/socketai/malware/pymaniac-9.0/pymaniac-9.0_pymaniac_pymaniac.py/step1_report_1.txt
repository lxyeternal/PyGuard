  "purpose": "The script collects user information, including system details, browser extensions, wallet data, and session files, then exfiltrates this data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org', 'http://ip-api.com/json/', and filesystem checks for wallet extensions, browser data, and Telegram session files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Telegram's API to send files and screenshots, and filesystem modifications (copying, zipping, deleting files).",
  "flows": "System info and files are collected from sources, compressed, and sent through Telegram API endpoints; data flows from system input to network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token, hardcoded file paths, and potential collection of sensitive wallet/session files without user consent. Use of pyautogui for screenshots and automatic exfiltration without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple data collection tasks: retrieves IP, geolocation, checks for cryptocurrency wallet extensions, and accesses Telegram session data. It then compresses and sends this data via Telegram, indicating malicious intent for unauthorized data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded Telegram bot token, combined with the automated collection and transmission of potentially sensitive data (wallets, session files, screenshots), confirms malicious behavior. The script operates covertly, gathering user information and exfiltrating it without user knowledge or permission.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data-stealing trojan, exfiltrating personal, financial, and session data via Telegram. Its behavior aligns with malicious intent, aiming to harvest sensitive information stealthily.",
