{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect user data, including files, screenshots, and system information, and exfiltrate it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Requests to external IP geolocation API, file system accesses for specific directories, reading user input via getpass, and taking screenshots with pyautogui.",
  "sinks": "Uploading files and screenshots to Telegram API endpoints, reading sensitive directories (Exodus, Ledger, Telegram tdata), and requesting IP info from external services.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, files, screenshot) is gathered and stored temporarily; then sent via HTTP POST requests to Telegram. Data flows from filesystem/API calls into the send functions which exfiltrate to Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "Code collects potentially sensitive files (Exodus wallet data, Telegram session files, browser extensions). Uses hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID. Exfiltration functions are embedded without user consent, and the code exits after execution without user notification. No input validation for file existence, and broad exception handling masks errors.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses user directories related to cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and messaging apps. It gathers IP and geolocation data, then captures a screenshot with system info and exfiltrates these via Telegram API. Functions for zipping, copying, and removing files are included, with no apparent user interaction. Hardcoded Telegram credentials facilitate covert data transmission. The overall behavior suggests data theft and unauthorized exfiltration. No obfuscation or malware signatures like reverse shells, network tunnels, or code injection are present. The code is structured straightforwardly, with clear intent to collect and transmit data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious, designed to steal wallet data, session files, and system information, then send it over Telegram. It operates covertly without user consent and exfiltrates sensitive data, representing a serious security risk.",
