  "purpose": "Import the 'pymaniac' module or object from the local package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'pymaniac' module or object from the current package.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data processing or external data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; no data flow occurs beyond module importation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs or secrets. The module name 'pymaniac' could be suspicious if it relates to malicious activity, but based solely on this code, no anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a relative import of 'pymaniac' from the current package. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior. Without additional context about what 'pymaniac' does, the import itself is benign. No hardcoded secrets, external network activity, or suspicious logic are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It is benign based on this fragment alone.",
