{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'pymaniac' from the same package directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading the 'pymaniac' module from local package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems observed",
  "flows": "Import statement itself does not define data flows; it merely loads a module",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; potential concern is whether 'pymaniac' module itself contains malicious code, but not in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a relative import of a module named 'pymaniac'. This by itself is benign and typical in Python package structures. Without inspecting the 'pymaniac' module contents, there is no indication of malicious activity in this line. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or network activity. The minimal code makes it impossible to evaluate for malware or security risks definitively, but based solely on this snippet, there are no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected at this level. Further analysis of the 'pymaniac' module would be necessary to confirm safety.",
