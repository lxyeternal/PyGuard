  "purpose": "Importing the 'pymaniac' class or function from the local module '.pymaniac'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code performs a simple import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a local import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and there are no suspicious or unusual patterns. The import statement is standard.",
  "analysis": "This code imports 'pymaniac' from a relative module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The minimal nature of the code makes it unlikely to contain malicious payloads or malicious intentions. Since only an import statement is present, it is not possible to assess any malicious activity without examining the 'pymaniac' module itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears benign.",
