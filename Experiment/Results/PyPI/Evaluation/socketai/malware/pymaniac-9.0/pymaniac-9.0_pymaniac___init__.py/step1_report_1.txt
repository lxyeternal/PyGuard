  "purpose": "Import the 'pymaniac' module from the local package",
  "sources": "The local import statement from the current package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, simple import statement; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a module named 'pymaniac' from the current package. There are no data inputs, no execution logic, and no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The import suggests reliance on a local module, which could be benign or malicious depending on the package contents, but this cannot be determined from this single line alone. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though full assessment depends on the contents of 'pymaniac'.",
