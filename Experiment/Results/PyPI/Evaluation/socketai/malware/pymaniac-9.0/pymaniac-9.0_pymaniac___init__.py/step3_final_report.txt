{
  "purpose": "Import 'pymaniac' from a local package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import loads a module but does not execute code or transfer data at this point.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward relative import with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is benign in isolation. No data inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The security implications depend entirely on the contents of the 'pymaniac' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence between 0.6 and 1.0) are consistent with the minimal code and its benign appearance. No logical errors or flaws are evident. The import statement itself does not pose a security risk, but further inspection of the 'pymaniac' module is recommended to confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The risk is minimal, and the scores are appropriate given the limited context. The overall security posture depends on the module's contents, which should be reviewed separately.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
