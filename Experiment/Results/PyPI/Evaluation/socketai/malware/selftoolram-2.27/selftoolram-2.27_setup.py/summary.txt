  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden and silent operation, and embedded malicious URL, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package setup code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious activity. It should be treated as malicious and avoided; further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended for definitive analysis."
