  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command triggered during package setup, combined with suspicious comments. The setup script itself appears benign but is exploited as a vector for malicious payload execution. The high scores are justified given the evidence, and the package should be flagged for further review or removal from distribution channels."
