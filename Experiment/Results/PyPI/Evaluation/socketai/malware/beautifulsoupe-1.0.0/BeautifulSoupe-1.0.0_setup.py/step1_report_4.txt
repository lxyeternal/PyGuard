{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that appears to be intentionally obfuscated and includes code that decrypts and executes embedded malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment (os.name), and the embedded encrypted data within the Fernet decrypt function.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which can be malicious. Also, the import of requests and Fernet occurs conditionally, potentially for network or cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "The code checks OS type, then decrypts data with Fernet, and executes it via exec(), leading to potential malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and function name; encrypted payload with Fernet, executed via exec(), which is a common obfuscation and malicious technique. Use of hardcoded key in code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated setup process, importing modules, and conditionally executing decrypted code on Windows systems. The presence of encrypted data and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it allows remote or hidden code execution. The use of Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key, and the execution of decrypted code without validation, indicates malicious behavior, potentially for malware delivery, backdoors, or unauthorized code execution. The rest of the setup configuration appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious payload mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains suspicious obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and dynamic code execution, indicating malicious intent. It likely functions as a backdoor or malicious installer when run on Windows systems. High confidence in malicious behavior due to encrypted payload and exec() usage.",
