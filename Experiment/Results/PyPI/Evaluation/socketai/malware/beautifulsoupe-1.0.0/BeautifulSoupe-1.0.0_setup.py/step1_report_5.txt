{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'BeautifulSoupe', with an embedded malicious run method in a custom install command class that decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, the encrypted Fernet key and ciphertext within the run method, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec, which can run arbitrary code with system privileges during package installation.",
  "flows": "Encrypted data in the run method is decrypted and executed, creating a source-to-sink flow that executes malicious code upon package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class contains a highly obfuscated method that decrypts and runs code at install time, which is suspicious. The code includes encrypted payload, misleading variable names, and a non-standard class name, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The setup script contains no meaningful description or author information, and the long description appears as random text.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. Inside run, it checks if the OS is Windows and then decrypts and executes code using Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext, which is malicious behavior. The setup function references the custom install class, ensuring this malicious code runs during package installation. The encrypted payload is likely malicious code intended to be executed in the target environment. The code also includes suspicious obfuscation techniques, such as encrypted payload and misleading variable/class names, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code embedded within an obfuscated custom install command that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated code strongly suggests malicious intent, including potential system compromise or remote code execution. The package is highly suspicious and should not be used.",
