{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'BeautifulSoupe' with obfuscated and potentially malicious code that decrypts and executes hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, embedded encrypted data, import statements (requests, Fernet), exec() call with decrypted code",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, import of requests and Fernet modules",
  "flows": "os.name condition → decryption of embedded data → execution of code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted code embedded directly in script, execution of decrypted code at install time, use of Fernet encryption with hardcoded key",
  "analysis": "The script defines an obfuscated setup process, including a custom install command that checks the operating system, then decrypts and executes code embedded as a Fernet-encrypted string. The encrypted payload, when decrypted, could contain malicious instructions. The presence of hardcoded encryption keys and execution of dynamic code indicates potential malicious intent. The code is designed to run during installation, which could allow malicious actions without user knowledge. The usage of third-party modules (requests, Fernet) is standard but combined with the obfuscation and decryption, suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime code execution, indicating malicious intent and potential backdoor behavior. The setup process is intentionally concealed, and the decrypted code could perform harmful actions. This is highly suspicious for a package, especially considering the context of supply chain risks.",
