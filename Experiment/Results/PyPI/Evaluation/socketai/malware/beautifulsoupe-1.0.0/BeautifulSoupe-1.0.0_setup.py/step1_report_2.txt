{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'BeautifulSoupe' with custom install behavior that decrypts and executes hidden code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment checks, and the embedded encrypted code within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts data using Fernet and executes it via exec(), creating a direct source-to-sink flow for potentially malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and function names appear obfuscated or intentionally complex, and the code decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload at runtime, which is suspicious. The description and long_description are nonsensical strings, possibly placeholders or obfuscation. Usage of exec() on decrypted data is inherently risky.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports requests and Fernet modules, decrypts a payload with Fernet, and executes it via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows execution of arbitrary code during package installation. The obfuscated class name and the encrypted payload indicate possible malicious intent or an attempt to hide malicious activity. The code does not perform any benign or transparent function beyond installing the package and executing hidden code. The dependencies listed ('fernet', 'requests') are standard libraries but are used here in a potentially malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows. The obfuscation, use of exec(), and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage. This package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
