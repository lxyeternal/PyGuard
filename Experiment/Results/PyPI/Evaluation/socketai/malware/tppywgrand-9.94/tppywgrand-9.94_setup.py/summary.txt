  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during package setup if a specific directory is missing. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious comment point toward malicious intent. The package should be flagged for further analysis, and decoding the PowerShell command is recommended to understand its payload. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
