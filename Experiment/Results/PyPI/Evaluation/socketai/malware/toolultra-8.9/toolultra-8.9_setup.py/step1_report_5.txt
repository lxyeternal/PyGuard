{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'toolultra' with associated metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists), imports modules (subprocess, os), and executes a subprocess command with encoded PowerShell instructions.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded payload, which could potentially be malicious or perform unwanted actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file/directory, then if absent, runs a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, possibly executing hidden code, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The embedded PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The command is executed with 'creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' to hide execution, and it runs asynchronously without proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs a standard setup routine for a Python package, importing necessary modules and defining package metadata. However, it contains an obfuscated PowerShell command that is triggered if a certain path does not exist. The encoded command appears to be a base64 string, which is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads. The execution is performed silently and asynchronously, without verification or logging, indicating suspicious behavior. The rest of the code seems benign, but the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell invocation raises a high concern for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script combines typical setup procedures with a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command that executes silently. This behavior suggests potential malicious activity, such as downloading or executing harmful payloads. The overall security risk is high, and the code warrants further investigation before use.",
