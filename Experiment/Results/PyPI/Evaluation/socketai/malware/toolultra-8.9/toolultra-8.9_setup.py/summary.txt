  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating malicious intent. The high obfuscation and covert execution justify high malware and risk scores. The package should be considered potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign behavior."
