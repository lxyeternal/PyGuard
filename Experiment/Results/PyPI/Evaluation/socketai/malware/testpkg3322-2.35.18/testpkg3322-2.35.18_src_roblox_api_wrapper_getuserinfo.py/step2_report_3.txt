  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a stub with no implementation.\n- The 'requests' library is imported but unused in all cases.\n- No actual data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code is incomplete or a placeholder, not actively performing any operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is minimal and does not perform any actions. The import of 'requests' is unnecessary but not malicious. The functions are empty.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a stub with no active logic.\n- They note the potential for future network activity due to the 'requests' import, but as it stands, there's no evidence of any security issue.\n- The reasoning that the code could be malicious based solely on the import is unfounded; the import alone is benign.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, also appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 or 0.2 in some reports, justified by the potential future use of network requests, but currently, no active risk exists.\n\n### Risk score justification:\n- Since the code is a placeholder with no active behavior, a risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, perhaps slightly conservative. No active security risk exists at this point.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- Some reports mention the 'requests' import as suspicious, but this is unwarranted without further context.\n- The reports do not challenge the fact that the code is incomplete; they accept it as benign, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the potential future network activity, but no current threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, incomplete stub with no malicious activity. The import of 'requests' is unnecessary but not suspicious. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's current state.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Note:** No evidence supports higher scores at this stage.",
