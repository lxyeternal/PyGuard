  "purpose": "The code is intended to provide functions for logging into the Roblox API using either cookie or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie' in cookielogin; 'username' and 'password' in userpasslogin.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the functions do not perform any operations or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since functions are placeholders with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; they are essentially stubs. No suspicious or malicious code, code injection, or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two function definitions intended for login operations but currently do nothing (pass statements). No data processing, network activity, or handling of sensitive information occurs. The presence of empty functions alone does not indicate malicious intent or security issues. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and appears to be a placeholder for future implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation at this stage.",
