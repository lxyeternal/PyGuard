{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for logging into the Roblox API using either cookies or username and password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' provided to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Currently, there are no sink operations such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks; the functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the functions do not contain any executable code or logic.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are defined but contain only 'pass' statements, indicating they do nothing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code defines two functions intended for login purposes but lacks any implementation. No external data is read or written, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior is present. The structure suggests placeholders rather than malicious intent. There are no anomalies or indicators of malware or security issues within this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-functional stub with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves as a template or placeholder for login functions but does not perform any actions. Based on the provided code, the security risk is negligible.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
