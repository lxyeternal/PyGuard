{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for logging into the Roblox API using either cookies or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password', which are inputs for login credentials.",
  "sinks": "There are no actual data processing or output operations present; the functions currently do nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur since the functions are empty and do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Both functions are placeholders with no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code, secrets, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists of two stub functions intended for login purposes, but they contain no actual logic or data handling. There are no sources that process untrusted input into vulnerable sinks. The code does not perform any operations, data transmission, or security-sensitive actions. The absence of implementation means there is no malicious activity or security risk currently present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional and contains only placeholders with no active logic or suspicious behavior. It poses no security threats or malware risk in its current form.",
