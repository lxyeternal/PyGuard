  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into Roblox API using cookie or username/password.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or external calls are implemented; functions are currently empty.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions are unimplemented and contain only 'pass'.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but do not perform any operations; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for login purposes but currently lack implementation. There are no data processing, external network calls, or code execution within the functions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is observable. The code appears to be a skeleton or placeholder for future development without any malicious intent or security issues at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, placeholder implementation with no active logic or malicious behavior. It does not pose security risks in its current form but should be reviewed once implemented for actual login processes.",
