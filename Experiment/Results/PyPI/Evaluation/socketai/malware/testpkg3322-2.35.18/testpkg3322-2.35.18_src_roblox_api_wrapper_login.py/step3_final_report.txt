  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API integration",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (inputs provided during function calls)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; functions are unimplemented",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; functions do nothing",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty with no implementation; no anomalies or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two stub functions with 'pass' statements, indicating no active logic or data handling. No network calls, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions are placeholders, likely for future development. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. Given the current inert state, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, non-functional placeholder functions with no malicious or security issues. The current security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The code's simplicity and lack of active logic justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
