  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All functions are placeholders with no implementation (`pass` statements).\n- No data processing, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The code is clearly a stub, likely intended for future development.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is non-functional, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1 (high)\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- *Assessment:* Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the functions are placeholders.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- *Assessment:* Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also notes the functions are empty placeholders.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- *Assessment:* Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: functions are stubs, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- *Assessment:* Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly different in that it assigns a small security risk (0.1) despite functions being empty.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- *Assessment:* Given the functions are just placeholders, assigning a risk of 0.1 might be overly cautious unless there's context suggesting future malicious intent. However, as a placeholder, the minimal risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a stub with no implementation.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Overall, negligible, with only a minimal 0.1 in one report, which seems acceptable given the placeholder nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- The code contains no malicious activity, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- No obfuscation detected or claimed.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Since the code is non-functional, no security risk exists at this stage.  \n- The minor 0.1 risk score in one report is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The functions are placeholders with no malicious or security implications.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the current state of the code accurately, emphasizing that it's just a scaffold for future development, not an active or malicious component.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf future implementations include actual login logic, network requests, or handling of sensitive data, re-evaluation would be necessary. For now, the current assessment stands correct.",
