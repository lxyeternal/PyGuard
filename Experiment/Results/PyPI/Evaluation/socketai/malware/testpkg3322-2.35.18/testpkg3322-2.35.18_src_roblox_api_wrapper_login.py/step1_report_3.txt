  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login procedures to roblox.com API, currently not implemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' as potential input sources.",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks or data processing occurs as functions are empty; potential future sinks could include network requests or credential storage.",
  "flows": "No data flows since functions are empty and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two login functions with no implementation or logic. There are no data processing, no network calls, and no use of environment variables or secrets. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder, possibly intended for future development. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the lack of implementation precludes any malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder with no operational behavior or malicious intent. It does not pose security risks or exhibit malicious activity in its current form.",
