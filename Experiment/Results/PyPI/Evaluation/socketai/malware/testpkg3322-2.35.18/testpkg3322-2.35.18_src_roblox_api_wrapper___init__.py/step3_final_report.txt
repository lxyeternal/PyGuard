  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, dynamic features like eval/exec, network/system calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into eval/exec or network calls, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscation patterns, suspicious data flows, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code, suspicious patterns, and obfuscation. Reports with dynamic features (eval/exec) and obfuscation are appropriately scored with moderate malware and risk levels. Absence of code leads to low scores. The scores align with the described behaviors, with higher concern in reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, but patterns warrant cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent with the evidence; reports with dynamic features and obfuscation are flagged with moderate risk and malware scores, reflecting potential concerns without definitive malicious activity. Overall, the scoring accurately reflects the analyzed behaviors.",
