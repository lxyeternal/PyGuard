{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended for sending messages between users, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (inputs), no external data sources or inputs used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; function does not process or transmit data, no external calls or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; function is a stub with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward stub with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty function 'send' with parameters but no implementation ('pass'). All reports correctly identify it as a placeholder with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the code's benign and incomplete nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present or inferred. The code poses no security threat in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's current state. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
