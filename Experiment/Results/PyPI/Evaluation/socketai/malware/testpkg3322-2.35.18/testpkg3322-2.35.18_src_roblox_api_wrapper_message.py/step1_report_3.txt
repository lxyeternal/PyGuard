{
  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are input sources; no external data sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "The actual message sending operation likely occurs within the 'send' function, but the implementation is missing; potential sinks are the function call itself or external systems called within it.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'send' function; without implementation, flow cannot be fully determined.",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined with no implementation ('pass'), which is unusual and suggests placeholder code or incomplete implementation. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function intended for messaging between users but contains no implementation. No code execution, data handling, or external calls are present. The empty function may be a stub or placeholder, but in its current state, it poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The absence of logic means no data processing, no code injection, and no potential for malicious actions within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a placeholder function with no logic or malicious intent. It does not perform any actions or data handling, thus presenting no security risk or malware potential. Its purpose seems to be defining an interface for message sending, pending implementation.",
