{
  "purpose": "Function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' that may receive input data",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code; potential for future implementation to send data over network or write to files",
  "flows": "Input parameters could flow into the message-sending process if implemented, but currently none",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' with three parameters but lacks any implementation. There are no data handling, no external calls, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The function's empty body suggests it is a placeholder. Without additional code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a placeholder function with no implementation. It poses no security threat, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. Its purpose appears to be to eventually facilitate message sending, but as-is, it is benign.",
