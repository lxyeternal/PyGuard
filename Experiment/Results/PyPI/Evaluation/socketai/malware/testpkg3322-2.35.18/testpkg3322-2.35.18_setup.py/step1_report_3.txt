{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package setup script that includes additional malicious behavior, specifically downloading and executing remote code, persistence mechanisms, and system shutdown commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing modules, and most critically, fetching data from a remote URL via urllib.request.urlretrieve.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to APPDATA and startup folder, executing a batch file, and initiating a system restart via os.system(\"shutdown /r /f\").",
  "flows": "The code retrieves a remote file and saves it as 'bbvvbb.bat' in APPDATA, reads this file, copies it to the Windows startup folder, and then executes a shutdown command, creating a persistent and potentially harmful setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of system functions to fetch and write remote files, copy batch files into startup for persistence, and trigger system shutdown. No clear benign purpose for these actions is evident. The URL used ('https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr') suggests command and control or remote payload retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a typical setup for a Python package but then proceeds to perform malicious actions. It downloads a remote file (likely a batch script) from a suspicious URL and saves it in the APPDATA directory. It then reads this file's contents and copies it into the Windows startup folder to ensure execution on system reboot. Finally, it issues a forced system restart command. The code employs obfuscation by hiding malicious intent behind standard package setup code and using environment variables to avoid hardcoded paths. The use of sys.frozen and other environment tricks indicates an attempt to remain undetected. These behaviors are characteristic of persistence and remote control mechanisms often used in malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including remote code download, persistence setup via startup folder modification, and system restart commands. The presence of remote URL retrieval and persistent file placement strongly indicates malware activity. Overall, the code is malicious with a high security risk score.",
