{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer and remote access tool, designed to extract sensitive information such as passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads. It also attempts to disable security mechanisms and kill security-related processes.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables, browser data files (Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), clipboard contents, process lists, system commands, and network requests to gather system info, tokens, cookies, passwords, browser histories, and user credentials.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests to exfiltrate data to webhooks and transfer.sh, writing data into text files, zipping and uploading collected data, and forcibly killing security processes like 'ProcessHacker', 'Wireshark', and 'discord.exe'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser files, clipboard, process enumeration, and system commands into in-memory variables; then, decrypted passwords, tokens, cookies, and info are uploaded via HTTP requests or saved into files; these files are compressed and sent to remote servers. Additionally, process termination commands and process creation flow from detection logic to system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs and addresses, obfuscated variable names, extensive use of try-except blocks suppressing errors, and attempts to disable security tools. The code actively kills security and debugging processes, disables security features, and exfiltrates system info and credentials. Usage of cryptographic functions to decrypt stored credentials and tokens suggests malicious intent. The script also manipulates clipboard data to replace wallet addresses, indicating credential hijacking.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by installing and importing numerous packages, many of which are used for system interaction, data encryption/decryption, network communication, and file operations. It collects system info, browser data, and tokens from various browsers and applications like Discord and Roblox, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates this information to a remote webhook. It also scans user directories for specific keywords to locate sensitive files, zips the collected data, and uploads it. Additional functions disable security tools, kill processes associated with debugging and security, and modify browser files for security bypass. The script's overall behavior indicates a comprehensive credential and data theft tool with self-protection and anti-debugging mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to stealthily harvest user credentials, cookies, tokens, browser history, and system info, exfiltrate data via webhooks and file uploads, and disable security features and processes. Its sophisticated techniques for decrypting credentials and hiding its activity confirm its harmful intent.",
