{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to stealthily extract sensitive information such as browser passwords, cookies, system details, Discord tokens, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads, often hiding itself in startup folders and terminating security-related processes.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, local app data directories for browsers, cookies, passwords, history, credit card info, and clipboard content. Reads Discord tokens from browser storage and extensions, and captures system info via subprocess and Windows registry.",
  "sinks": "Posts data to specified Discord webhook URLs; writes data to temporary files and archives them into ZIP files; uploads files to external servers; kills security-related processes (e.g., debuggers, process explorers); modifies browser files and configurations to disable protections; terminates itself or system processes.",
  "flows": "System info and extracted credentials are collected from various sources, processed and encrypted/decrypted as needed, then sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and external hosting services. Data is also stored temporarily and zipped for bulk exfiltration. Browser data flows from local files to decrypted plaintext, then to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded URLs and webhook addresses pointing to suspicious domains; disables process monitoring/debugging tools; terminates security processes; attempts to manipulate browser profiles and extensions; uses obfuscated or concatenated strings for sensitive data. Excessive use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding malicious activity. Files are renamed and archives created for covert transfer.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive malware toolkit tailored for data theft, browser hijacking, and process termination. It employs multiple techniques to gather user credentials, cookies, browsing history, system info, and Discord tokens, then exfiltrates this information stealthily via HTTP requests to webhook URLs and external file hosting. It disables security tools, modifies browser files to disable protections, and terminates processes related to debuggers and virtual machines to evade detection. Its structure indicates an intent for persistent data harvesting and stealthy operation. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process kill commands, and extensive data collection points confirm malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, aiming to steal sensitive user data, disable security measures, and exfiltrate information covertly. It employs multiple anti-detection techniques, including process termination, self-replication in startup folders, and data obfuscation. The overall security risk score is very high, and malware likelihood is confirmed. It should not be used and poses a severe threat to user systems.",
