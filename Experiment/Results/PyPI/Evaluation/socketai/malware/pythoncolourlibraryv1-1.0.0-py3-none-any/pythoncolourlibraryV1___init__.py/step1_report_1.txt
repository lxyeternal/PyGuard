{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration and system compromise, including theft of cookies, passwords, browser history, system information, and potentially sensitive files, then uploading or transmitting this data to external servers or services.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), files on local machine (browser data, history, cookies, passwords, cookies, credit card info), clipboard content, process enumeration, network requests to external URLs, subprocess outputs, registry keys, process information, user input, and hardcoded configurations.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external webhooks and servers (e.g., kekwltd.ru, transfer.sh), file creation and upload (ZIP archives, text logs, screenshots), command execution (e.g., 'taskkill'), process termination commands, and system modifications (e.g., removing files, killing processes, registry edits).",
  "flows": "Data is collected from various sources like browser data, cookies, credentials, and system info; decrypted or processed; then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to external servers or uploaded to file sharing services. Data flows from system sources -> local processing -> external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL and external relay URL, extensive data collection without user consent, disabling or modifying security measures (e.g., bypassing token protection, disabling certain processes), deleting files, and uploading potentially sensitive user data. Use of obfuscation techniques such as dynamic code, encrypted data, and extensive registry or process checks to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious actions including stealing browser cookies, passwords, history, credit card info, and Roblox tokens. It also captures screenshots and system info, then zips and uploads these files to external servers or sharing services. The code also terminates security processes, disables certain protections, and modifies browser or system files. Hardcoded URLs and extensive environment checks indicate a clear intent to exfiltrate user data stealthily. The code employs functions to decrypt stored credentials, scan for specific processes, and prevent debugging or VM detection. Overall, it is designed as a comprehensive info-stealer with potential for further malicious activities like malware persistence or system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly malicious, performing extensive data theft, system espionage, and exfiltration. It contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including data collection from browsers, system info, clipboard, process management, and uploading to external servers. The code also attempts to disable security features and hide its activity. Overall, it represents a serious security threat.",
