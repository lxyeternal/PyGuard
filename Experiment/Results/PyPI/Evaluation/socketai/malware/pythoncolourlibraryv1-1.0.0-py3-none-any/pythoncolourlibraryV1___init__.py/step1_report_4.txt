{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including system information, browser credentials, cookies, tokens, and personal files, then upload this data to a remote server and Discord webhook. It also contains malicious features such as process killing, process hiding, and potential wallet theft.",
  "sources": "The code reads system environment variables, browser local storage and cookies, SQLite database files (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), clipboard data, and user files from Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. It also reads local state files for decrypting stored credentials.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to remote URLs, including a webhook and file uploads to transfer.sh. Sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, tokens, and personal files are exfiltrated and uploaded to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data sources such as browser data, clipboard, system info, and user files are decrypted and collected in local variables. These are then formatted into messages or files and uploaded via HTTP requests or file uploads. The code also kills processes, modifies browser files, and gathers system info to enhance stealth.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded webhooks, hardcoded addresses, extensive process termination commands, obfuscation patterns (e.g., encrypted and encrypted-looking strings), and malicious behaviors such as stealing cookies, tokens, passwords, capturing screenshots, and exfiltrating files. It also attempts to disable security measures and modify browser files, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code operates as a credential stealer and data exfiltrator, targeting browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and files. It includes obfuscated or encrypted strings, extensive use of system commands, and network requests to external servers and webhooks. It kills security-related processes, modifies browser files, and hides itself from detection. The code is designed for malicious data collection and exfiltration, with features that disable security protections and steal sensitive information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits high malicious intent, aimed at stealing user data, compromising security, and exfiltrating information stealthily. It also contains mechanisms to disable security features, hide processes, and propagate itself through startup modifications. Overall, the code has a high probability of being malicious malware.",
