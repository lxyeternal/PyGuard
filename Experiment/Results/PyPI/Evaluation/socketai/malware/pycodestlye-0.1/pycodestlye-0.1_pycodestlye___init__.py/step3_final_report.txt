  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution points, hardcoded secrets, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into data processing or network transmission functions; dynamic eval or exec may execute obfuscated code, leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (complex control flow, dynamic eval), unusual imports, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names, excessive dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of complexity and obfuscation across reports. Reports 1 and 3 lack code, correctly leading to low confidence and scores. Reports 2 and 4 describe straightforward or minimally ambiguous code, with high confidence in benign assessment and low security risks. Report 5 describes complex, potentially obfuscated code with dynamic features and suspicion of malicious intent, but no definitive malicious activity. The obfuscation score (0.7) is justified; malware suspicion (0.2) may be slightly underestimated given the obfuscation and dynamic features, so increasing it to around 0.4 would better reflect the potential risk. Overall, the scores are consistent with the descriptions, but caution is advised for highly obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with appropriate scoring. Report 5's obfuscation and complexity suggest a moderate threat level; increasing the malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 would better align with the suspicion. The overall security posture remains low risk but warrants further static/dynamic analysis for suspicious packages.",
