  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low or no malicious activity, with appropriate scoring. Report 5's obfuscation and complexity suggest a moderate threat level; increasing the malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 would better align with the suspicion. The overall security posture remains low risk but warrants further static/dynamic analysis for suspicious packages."
