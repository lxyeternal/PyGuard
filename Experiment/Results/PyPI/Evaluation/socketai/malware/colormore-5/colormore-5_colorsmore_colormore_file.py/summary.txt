  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing covert exfiltration of sensitive wallet files and user data to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. It uses hardcoded credentials and external IP geolocation, with no legitimate purpose. The overall security risk and malware scores should be set to the maximum (1), reflecting high severity and malicious intent."
