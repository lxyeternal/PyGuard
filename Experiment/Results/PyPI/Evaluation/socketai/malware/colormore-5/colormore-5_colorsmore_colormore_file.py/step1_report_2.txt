{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user information related to Exodus wallet files and credentials, compress them, and send them via a Telegram bot, potentially for malicious exfiltration.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, filesystem paths for wallet files, and network requests to obtain IP address and send data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints (sendMessage and sendDocument) where the collected data is transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "The code reads wallet and configuration files from specific directories, compresses these files into a ZIP archive, then uploads this archive and a message containing IP and country info to a Telegram bot, indicating data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, extensive collection of wallet-related files without user consent, and transmission of potentially sensitive data to external servers. The code also constructs a message with location info and images user data, which strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by gathering user-specific paths and environment variables, then checks for existence of wallet-related files. If found, it creates a ZIP archive and attempts to include sensitive files, with multiple try-except blocks that suppress errors. It constructs a message that includes a geolocation lookup via an IP API, appends country flags, and sends this data along with the ZIP file to a Telegram bot. The hardcoded credentials and collection of user data without consent are typical of malicious data theft or a supply chain attack aiming to exfiltrate user data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by stealthily collecting sensitive wallet files and user info, then exfiltrating the data via a Telegram bot, indicating high malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the focus on exfiltration strongly suggest it is malicious malware designed for data theft.",
