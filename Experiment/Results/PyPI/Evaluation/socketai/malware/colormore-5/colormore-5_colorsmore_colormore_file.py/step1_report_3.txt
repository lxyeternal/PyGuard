{
  "purpose": "The code collects user-specific files related to Exodus wallet, compresses them, and sends them via Telegram, likely for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Get user name from getpass.getuser(), environment variables for paths, and file existence checks; requests to external IP API; reading files to zip and send.",
  "sinks": "Writing files into a zip archive; sending a message and document via Telegram API with the collected data.",
  "flows": "User data paths are checked and files added to zip; if files exist, they are zipped; external IP and country code fetched; message constructed; data sent via Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; use of requests to external IP service; collecting multiple sensitive wallet files; sending these files outside the user's system without user consent; dynamic construction of message including IP and country flag.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses user-specific wallet files, compresses them, and transmits them to an external server (Telegram) without user consent, indicating potential data theft. The use of hardcoded credentials and sending of sensitive wallet information signifies malicious intent. The code dynamically builds a message including user info, IP address, and country flag, then exfiltrates files, fitting typical malware behavior. No obfuscation is present, but the combination of actions is suspicious. It does not appear to be part of a legitimate function; instead, it performs covert data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code acts as a data exfiltration tool, collecting wallet-related files and transmitting them via Telegram, with embedded credentials and external IP lookup. It exhibits malicious behavior consistent with malware designed for wallet or user data theft. The overall security risk is high due to unauthorized data collection and transmission.",
