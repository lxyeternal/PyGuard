{
  "purpose": "The script collects specific user data related to Exodus wallet files and sends it to a Telegram bot, potentially for unauthorized access or theft of sensitive information.",
  "sources": "Reads user environment variables, existence of wallet-related files, and specific wallet files (exodus.conf.json, seed, passphrase, etc.). Fetches IP address and country code via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends a message and files via Telegram bot API, including potentially sensitive files and user data.",
  "flows": "Collects wallet files and user info, zips them, then uploads both the ZIP and a message containing user IP, country, and a wallet-related notification to Telegram.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; access to user wallet files and credentials; exfiltration of files without user consent; fetching IP and geolocation data; no clear user benefit; extensive use of try-except blocks that suppress errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to locate specific Exodus wallet files and related sensitive data, package them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrate this data via a Telegram bot. It uses hardcoded credentials, which is suspicious, and captures user IP and country information for contextual messaging. The process involves no user interaction or notification, suggesting malicious intent. The file handling and network requests are typical of data exfiltration malware. The code structure and variable naming do not indicate obfuscation or benign functionality; rather, they point toward data theft. The presence of multiple try-except blocks that suppress errors might be to avoid detection or crash reporting. Overall, this code appears to be malicious, aiming to steal wallet data and user location info covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, designed to steal sensitive wallet files and user information, then exfiltrate them to a remote server via Telegram. It hardcodes credentials, accesses user data without consent, and automates exfiltration, indicating high malicious intent.",
