{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet files, configuration data, and user information by compressing them into a ZIP archive and sending them via a Telegram bot, along with external IP and geolocation data, without user consent.",
  "sources": "Reads wallet files, configuration files, password files, environment variables, and user directories; fetches external IP and geolocation via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to Telegram API endpoints, transmitting the ZIP archive and message containing user info and IP details.",
  "flows": "Collects sensitive files and environment info (source), compresses files into ZIP, constructs message with IP and country info, then transmits ZIP and message via Telegram API (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of wallet and sensitive files without user consent; suppression of errors via try-except blocks; no obfuscation but malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert collection of wallet and user data, compresses files, and exfiltrates via Telegram, using hardcoded credentials and external IP geolocation. It operates without user consent, indicating malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and employs error suppression to avoid detection or crashes. All signals point to malicious exfiltration and data theft, with high confidence in malicious intent and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing covert exfiltration of sensitive wallet files and user data to an attacker-controlled Telegram account. It uses hardcoded credentials and external IP geolocation, with no legitimate purpose. The overall security risk and malware scores should be set to the maximum (1), reflecting high severity and malicious intent.",
