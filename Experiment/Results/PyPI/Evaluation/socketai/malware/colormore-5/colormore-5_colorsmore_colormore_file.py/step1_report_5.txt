{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect user data related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet files and send this data to a Telegram bot, potentially for malicious purposes such as stealing wallet information.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), user input via getpass, and file existence checks. Also reads user-specific files such as wallet configuration and wallet data files.",
  "sinks": "Sends messages and files via Telegram API, uploads collected wallet files as documents, and fetches external IP and country information.",
  "flows": "Collects wallet files and user info -> zips sensitive files -> sends messages and documents via Telegram -> deletes zip file after transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of sensitive wallet data, sending of potentially sensitive files to external server without user consent, use of requests to external IP geolocation services, and obfuscation of wallet-related file paths. The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current user's username and environment variables to locate potential Exodus wallet files. If such files exist, it creates a ZIP archive containing these files, some of which are wallet configurations, seed, passphrases, and 2FA info. It also appends a message indicating which files have been added. The script then retrieves the public IP address and country code, modifies the message to include flag emojis representing the country, and sends both a message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram bot. The ZIP file is then deleted locally. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the collection and exfiltration of sensitive wallet data indicate malicious intent, likely aimed at stealing cryptocurrency assets. The code structure and actions align with typical data-stealing malware scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive wallet files and user information to an external server via Telegram. It hardcodes credentials, collects sensitive user data, and automates exfiltration without user consent, indicating a high-security threat. It should be considered malicious malware.",
