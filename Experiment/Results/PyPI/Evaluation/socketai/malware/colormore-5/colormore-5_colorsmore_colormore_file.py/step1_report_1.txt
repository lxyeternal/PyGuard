{
  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files and sends this data to a remote server via Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "User environment variables, local file system paths, and external IP address via HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints (sendMessage and sendDocument), file operations (reading and deleting zip files).",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from user directories and environment variables, then compressed into a zip file, and finally transmitted via Telegram API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of potentially sensitive wallet and password files, encoding sensitive files into zip archive, and automatic sending of this data over network to external server. Use of requests to external IP API and Telegram for data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user-specific data such as wallet files, passwords, and configuration files from the user's directory structure, then compresses these files into a zip archive. It retrieves the user's IP address and country code, converts the country code into emoji flags, and constructs a message containing this info. The zip archive and message are sent to a Telegram bot, which indicates exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet data. Hardcoded credentials and the automated collection and transfer of sensitive files strongly suggest malicious intent, possibly for theft or espionage. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign functionality. Its structure and purpose align with typical data theft or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting sensitive wallet data, environment info, and transmitting it to an external attacker-controlled Telegram account. It leverages hardcoded credentials and manipulates user files without consent, indicating a high risk of malicious intent.",
