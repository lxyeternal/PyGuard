  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only notable issue is the URL pointing to a different project, which is likely a documentation or metadata error rather than a security concern. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1)."
