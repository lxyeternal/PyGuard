      "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to stealthily inject a browser extension that intercepts sensitive data, modify system shortcuts for persistence, and obfuscate its JavaScript payload to evade detection. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and reflect the severity of the threat."

Slightly increased malware scores for reports involving network/subprocess activity and obfuscation are justified. No adjustments are necessary unless further code analysis reveals concrete malicious payloads."
