  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, subprocess calls, eval()/exec(), input functions, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, subprocess execution, eval/exec, data leakage points, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) -> processing functions -> network/subprocess eval/exec sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), dynamic code execution, obfuscation, unvalidated network requests, complex logic to obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as network requests, subprocess calls, and dynamic code execution. Reports with no code or inert scripts show minimal risk. Reports with network activity and eval/exec usage indicate moderate suspicion, justified by malware scores around 0.4-0.45 and security risks of 0.6. Obfuscation is noted in some reports, aligning with scores of 0.4. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with higher suspicion in reports involving dynamic execution and network activity. No evidence of confirmed malicious payloads is present, but the potential for misuse warrants these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the behaviors described. Slightly increased malware scores for reports involving network/subprocess activity and obfuscation are justified. No adjustments are necessary unless further code analysis reveals concrete malicious payloads.",
