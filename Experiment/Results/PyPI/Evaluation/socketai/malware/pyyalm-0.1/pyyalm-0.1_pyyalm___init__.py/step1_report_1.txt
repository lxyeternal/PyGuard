  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a utility or library function, but without additional context, the intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files (if any are present), and may also accept parameters or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, subprocess calls, or data transmissions that could leak information or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, subprocess), possibly passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected from the provided code segment.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard operations such as importing libraries, defining functions, and possibly handling data. Without specific code snippets, no malicious patterns such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are identified. The structure does not suggest obfuscation or malware. Due to the absence of concrete code, the analysis remains limited, but no signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the description.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical Python script or library without evident backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
