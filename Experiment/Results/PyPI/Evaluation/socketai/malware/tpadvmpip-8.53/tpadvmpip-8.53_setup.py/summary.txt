  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, conditional PowerShell payload execution during package setup, embedded suspicious URL, and stealth tactics. The pattern aligns with common malware behaviors such as hidden remote code execution and command-and-control communication. Scores are justified as malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.85, indicating a high threat level. Further decoding of the Base64 payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, and the package should be flagged for review or removal."
