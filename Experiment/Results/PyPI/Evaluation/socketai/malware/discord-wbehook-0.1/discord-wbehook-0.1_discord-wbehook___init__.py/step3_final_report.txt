  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, code execution functions (e.g., eval()), class definitions, standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "eval() on environment variables, external data inputs, potential network connections (if any), file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or external inputs flow into eval() or other execution points, leading to potential code execution or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on environment variables without validation, absence of obfuscation, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are predominantly benign, with standard library usage and no suspicious patterns. The notable exception is the use of eval() on environment variables, which is a well-known security risk. The benign code shows no obfuscation or malicious intent. The high confidence in malicious detection is justified only for patterns involving eval() on untrusted data. The overall security risk correlates with the presence of dangerous eval() usage. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low malware and risk scores. The only significant concern is the use of eval() on environment variables, which warrants a high malware score (~0.75) and security risk (~0.8). The assessments are appropriate and align with best security practices.",
