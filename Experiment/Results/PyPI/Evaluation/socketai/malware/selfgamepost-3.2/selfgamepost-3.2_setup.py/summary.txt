  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely used as a delivery mechanism for malicious payloads or backdoors. The scores assigned are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious until further payload analysis confirms benign intent."
