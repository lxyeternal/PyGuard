      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The pattern of silent, encoded command execution aligns with tactics used in malicious packages. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as potentially malicious and conducting further static and dynamic analysis before use."
