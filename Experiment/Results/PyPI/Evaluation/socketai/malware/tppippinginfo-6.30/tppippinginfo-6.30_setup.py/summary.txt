  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious-looking PowerShell execution during package setup, with embedded suspicious URL and stealth flags. It strongly suggests malicious activity, such as remote payload download or execution, constituting a high security threat. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until payload is decoded and verified."
