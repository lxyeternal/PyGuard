  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious-looking PowerShell execution during package setup, triggered conditionally based on filesystem state. The behavior, obfuscation, and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a high malware score (~0.85) and security risk (~0.85). The scores in the reports are justified and consistent with the evidence, indicating a serious security threat that should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms payload details."
