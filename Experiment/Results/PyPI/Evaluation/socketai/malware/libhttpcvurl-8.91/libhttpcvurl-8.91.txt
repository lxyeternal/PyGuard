      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The pattern aligns with common tactics in supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The high scores are justified and suggest this package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further payload analysis is performed."
