  "purpose": "Import the 'nagogy' module and instantiate or use it via the 'nagogy' object or function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'nagogy' module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data output or network calls shown",
  "flows": "Import of 'nagogy' package, but no further data flow or execution shown",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no visible anomalies or malicious indicators; lack of context or further code limits detection",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'nagogy' module from an external package. There is no additional code, function calls, or data handling that could suggest malicious behavior. Without further context or code, it appears to be a benign import statement. However, importing a package without usage or verification might be risky if the package itself contains malicious code, but that is outside this snippet's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior within this fragment. There is insufficient evidence of malicious intent or security risks directly from this code alone.",
