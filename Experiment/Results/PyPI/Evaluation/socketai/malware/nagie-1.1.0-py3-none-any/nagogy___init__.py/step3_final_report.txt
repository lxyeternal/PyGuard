  "purpose": "Minimal import of the 'nagogy' module, with no further code or data flow.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'nagogy' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "None; code only imports the module without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data flow, or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious indicators. The 'nagogy' package is external and its behavior unknown, but the code itself does not perform any suspicious actions. Malware score is correctly 0; obfuscation is absent; security risk is minimal due to lack of activity, though caution with external packages is advised. Confidence is high that the code is benign, but the unknown package warrants further inspection outside this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate; the minimal code poses very low security risk. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'nagogy' package, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
