  "purpose": "Import the 'nagogy' module and instantiate or access its 'nagogy' attribute or function.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the 'nagogy' module; any data reading occurs if 'nagogy' is called or used later.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks depend on subsequent code using 'nagogy'—not present here; no direct untrusted data sink identified in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be fully determined as no further usage is shown; the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, just a module import; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for 'nagogy' and accessing its 'nagogy' attribute. Without further context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or anomalous activity. The import itself is standard in Python; no data flows or input sources are present in this snippet. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no detectable malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment. It does not exhibit suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
