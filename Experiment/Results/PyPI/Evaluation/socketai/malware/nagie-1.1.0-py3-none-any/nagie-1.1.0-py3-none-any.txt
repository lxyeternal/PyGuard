      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an untrusted external executable without validation, posing a high security risk. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns and malware distribution tactics. Scores of malware: 0.9, security risk: 0.9, obfuscation: 0 are justified."
