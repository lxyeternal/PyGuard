{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file from a remote URL, potentially to run malicious software.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch remote content; response.content used for file writing",
  "sinks": "open() to save the downloaded file; os.system() to execute the downloaded file",
  "flows": "requests.get() fetches data from URL -> response.content writes to 'windows.exe' -> os.system() executes 'windows.exe'",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from a suspicious URL and immediately executing it without verification or user consent",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a file from an external URL, saves it as 'windows.exe', and then executes it. The URL appears suspicious and could host malware. The lack of validation, such as checksum verification, combined with immediate execution, indicates a high risk of malicious activity. The code does not implement security checks or user confirmation, suggesting intent to run potentially harmful software.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to download and run an executable from an untrusted source without validation or user approval.",
