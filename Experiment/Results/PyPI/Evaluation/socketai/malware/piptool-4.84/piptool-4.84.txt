      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed stealthily, indicating malicious activity such as remote payload download or execution. The benign appearance of the setup code is a cover for malicious behavior. The high obfuscation, stealth, and silent error handling justify high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. It should be treated as malicious until further analysis (e.g., decoding the payload) confirms otherwise."
