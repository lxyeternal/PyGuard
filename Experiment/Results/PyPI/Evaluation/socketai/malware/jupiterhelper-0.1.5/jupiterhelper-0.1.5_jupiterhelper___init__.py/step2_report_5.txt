  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a single import statement in a Python `__init__.py` file: `from .helper import init_helper`.\n   - There are no data flows, no network activity, no code execution beyond import, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, standard for package initialization, and does not involve any obfuscation or hidden behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - Based on the code snippet, **no issues are present**. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments about security risk, malware, and obfuscation are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in benign nature)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Justification of Risk & Malware Scores:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, no suspicious code, and no external data flow, the scores of 0 for `malware` and `securityRisk` are justified.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package setup, so no higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n6. **Potential for Misinterpretation:**\n   - The only scenario where a higher score might be considered is if the imported function `init_helper` itself contains malicious code. However, without inspecting the `helper` module, we cannot assume this.\n   - The reports focus solely on this file, which is benign.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, harmless package initialization pattern.\n   - The reports are accurate and do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
