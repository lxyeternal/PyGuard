{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'init_helper' function from the 'helper' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .helper import init_helper",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "The import flow loads 'init_helper' from the local helper module, no data flows to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports a specific function from a sibling module. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious code. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is typical for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only to expose 'init_helper' during package import, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
