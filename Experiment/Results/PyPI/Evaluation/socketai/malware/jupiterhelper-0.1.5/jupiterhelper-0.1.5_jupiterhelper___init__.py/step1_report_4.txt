  "purpose": "This module imports the 'init_helper' function or object from the helper module within the same package, likely for initialization or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .helper import init_helper",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports init_helper from helper module; no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in 'init_helper' from a sibling module. It does not perform any input, output, or data processing, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The minimal structure suggests standard package initialization behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern used for organizing package components.",
