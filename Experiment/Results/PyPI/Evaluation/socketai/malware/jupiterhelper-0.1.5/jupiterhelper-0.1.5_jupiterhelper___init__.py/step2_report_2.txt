  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their assessments, scores, and reasoning.\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .helper import init_helper`.  \n- **Is the reported code present?** Yes, the code is straightforward and matches the description.  \n- **Does the code contain any malicious or suspicious behavior?** No, it's a standard package initialization pattern.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`. This aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- Since the code is just an import statement with no suspicious activity, assigning a risk score of 0 and malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- The reports correctly do not overstate the risk or malware potential.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they do not infer malicious intent where none exists.  \n- They correctly interpret the code as standard package setup.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores given are appropriate and justified.  \n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is a straightforward, benign import statement serving as a package initializer, with no security concerns.",
