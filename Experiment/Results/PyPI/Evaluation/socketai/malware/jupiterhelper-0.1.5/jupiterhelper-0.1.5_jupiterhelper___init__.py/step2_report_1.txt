  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Logic:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .helper import init_helper`.\n   - There are no data flows, network activity, or execution of untrusted code.\n   - The code is standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` file, serving to expose or initialize components.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are identified in any report.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not handle any inputs, secrets, or perform any operations beyond importing.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign scores: `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware and Risk Scores:**\n   - Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The security risk score is also appropriately 0.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n6. **Potential for Misinterpretation:**\n   - The only consideration is whether the import could be part of a malicious setup, but given the context, it appears standard.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are warranted here.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Continue monitoring for more complex code snippets, but this particular code snippet is clearly safe.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current assessments.**",
