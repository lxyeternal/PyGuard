  "purpose": "Package initialization by importing a helper function",
  "sources": "Import statement in __init__.py: 'from .helper import init_helper'",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'init_helper' from helper module; no data flows beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement in a package's __init__.py file, serving to expose or initialize components. No data flows, network activity, or execution of untrusted code are present. The code is standard and minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package initialization, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
