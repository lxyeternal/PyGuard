  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .helper import init_helper\n   ```\n   This is a standard pattern in Python package `__init__.py` files to expose or initialize certain functions. There are no data flows, no input handling, no network activity, and no code execution beyond importing a function.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - **Are the reported issues present?**  \n     All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.  \n     **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as minimal, standard, and benign.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n   - Given the code's simplicity, these scores are appropriate.  \n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, which seems justified.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:  \n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a `malware` score of 0 is correct.  \n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is appropriate because there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.  \n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is also correct, as there's no obfuscation or code hiding.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.  \n- No further action or concern is warranted based on these reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward import statement used for package initialization. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
