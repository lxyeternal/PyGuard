  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'jupiterhelper' for distribution, specifying its metadata, dependencies, and console entry point.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata; 'install_requires' list; 'entry_points' for console script",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'init_helper' function from 'jupiterhelper.helper' module via command line",
  "flows": "User installs package -> executes 'jupiterhelper' command -> triggers 'jupiterhelper.helper:init_helper' function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected; standard setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and a console script entry point. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior is present. The only executable aspect is the 'init_helper' function invocation when the console script runs, but its content is unknown and not suspicious by default. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears to be a normal, benign package configuration with no evident malicious intent. The execution depends on the 'init_helper' function implementation, which is not provided, but the setup code itself does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
