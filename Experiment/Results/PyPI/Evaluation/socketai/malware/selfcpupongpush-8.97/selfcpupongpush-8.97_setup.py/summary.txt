  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, with embedded malicious URL and hidden execution flags. It is highly likely malicious, designed to evade detection and potentially deliver malicious payloads. The overall security risk is very high; the package should be considered malicious or compromised."
