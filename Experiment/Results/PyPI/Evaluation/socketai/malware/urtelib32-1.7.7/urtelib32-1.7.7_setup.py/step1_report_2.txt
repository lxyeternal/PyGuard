  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to elevate privileges, download, and execute code from a remote server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URL (http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png), reading local file 'image.png'.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing the decoded content of 'image.png', which is downloaded from the internet.",
  "flows": "Download data from remote server -> decode base64 -> write to 'image.png' -> read 'image.png' -> execute its contents.",
  "anomalies": "Elevates privileges unconditionally; downloads and executes remote code; hardcoded URL and headers; use of exec on downloaded data; redundant imports; suspicious admin privilege escalation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that attempts to acquire administrator privileges on Windows. It then downloads a file from a remote server, saves it as 'image.png', and executes its decoded content via exec(). The use of a remote URL, base64 decoding, and exec() indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, such as remote code execution. The code also manipulates privileges and silently executes downloaded code, which is characteristic of malware behavior. The code structure is straightforward but contains suspicious patterns and hardcoded URLs and headers, indicating malicious or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by elevating privileges, downloading remote code, and executing it without validation. These actions suggest it is designed for remote command execution or backdoor access, making it highly dangerous.",
