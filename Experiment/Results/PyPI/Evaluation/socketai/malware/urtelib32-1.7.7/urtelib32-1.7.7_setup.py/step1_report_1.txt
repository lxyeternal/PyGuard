  "purpose": "This setup script defines a custom installation process that attempts to elevate privileges and fetches an image from a remote server, executing its contents as code.",
  "sources": "Reading local file 'image.png', network request to 'http://wpp-api-01hw.onrender.com/api/images/1140884481671188581/image.png', command-line arguments, and environment during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing decoded content of 'image.png' with exec, and potential privilege escalation via ShellExecuteW.",
  "flows": "Request fetches image from remote server -> saves to 'image.png' -> reads and decodes 'image.png' -> executes decoded content -> attempts privilege escalation.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching code from a suspicious URL, decoding and executing content from an image file, privilege escalation attempt, hardcoded URL and headers, use of exec on external content, multiple imports inside run method.",
  "analysis": "The script customizes the install process to include privilege escalation by attempting to run with admin rights if not already. It then retrieves an image from a remote server, writes it locally as 'image.png', reads this file, decodes it from base64, and executes the resulting code. The URL and headers are suspicious, indicating potential malicious activity such as remote code execution. The use of 'exec' on fetched data is a major security concern, as it can execute arbitrary code from an external source. The privilege escalation attempt suggests an intent to gain higher system privileges. These behaviors align with malicious activities like backdoor installation or remote code execution. Overall, the code contains clear signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to remote code fetching and execution, privilege escalation attempt, and hardcoded malicious-looking URL. It exhibits malicious behavior designed to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, indicating a severe security threat.",
