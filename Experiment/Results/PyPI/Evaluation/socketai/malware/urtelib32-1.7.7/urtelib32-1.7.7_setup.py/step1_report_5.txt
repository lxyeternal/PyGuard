  "purpose": "Custom installation process that attempts to elevate privileges, download a file, and execute its content.",
  "sources": "User input: installation command arguments; network request to external URL; file read operation for 'image.png'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded code via exec(b64decode(open('image.png').read()))",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers privilege escalation, downloads a potentially malicious image, and executes its decoded content.",
  "anomalies": "Code requests administrator privileges; downloads an external image and executes it as code; hardcoded URL and headers; use of exec with decoded data; suspicious filename 'image.png' used to store executable content.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that attempts to run with administrator privileges. It downloads data from an external URL, saving it as 'image.png'. It then decodes this file from base64 and executes it as Python code, which is highly suspicious. The URL and header suggest control by an external entity. The code uses exec insecurely on downloaded data, which could be malicious. The attempt to elevate privileges and execute remote code indicates malicious intent. No benign purpose is evident from this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior: it escalates privileges, downloads external content, and executes it without validation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.",
