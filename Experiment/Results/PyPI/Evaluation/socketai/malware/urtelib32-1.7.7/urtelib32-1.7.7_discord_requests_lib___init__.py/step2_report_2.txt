  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code against the described issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code aligns with the description; it manages proxies with embedded credentials, rate limiting, and proxy rotation based on server responses. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant logical errors or security flaws are identified. The only potential concern is handling of sensitive credentials if exposed, but that’s outside the code’s logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which matches the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk is low (0.2). Obfuscated is 0, which is correct.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is standard, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Same as above; the code functions as a proxy manager with rate limiting and proxy rotation. No malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No evident issues. Error handling is minimal but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Similar to previous; straightforward proxy utility.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malware, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Again, a typical proxy request handler. No malicious logic.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious behavior or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign; no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Same as others; a utility class for proxy requests.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malware, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code’s behavior. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.2-0.3), mainly due to embedding credentials and proxy management, which could be sensitive if secrets are mishandled but are not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\nGiven the code’s nature and the reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (standard proxy management with embedded credentials; potential security concern if secrets are hardcoded or exposed, but no active malicious behavior)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical proxy request utility with rate limiting and proxy rotation. No malware or malicious obfuscation is present. The minor security risk is due to credential handling, not malicious intent.\n\n---",
