  "purpose": "A proxy management utility that handles proxy rotation, rate limiting, and request execution for HTTP methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxies, request method, URL, headers, JSON payload, files; response JSON for rate limit info.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL construction with embedded credentials; network requests via requests library; response handling for rate limits and blocks.",
  "flows": "Proxy credentials are embedded into proxy URLs; requests are made via selected proxies; responses are inspected for rate limit or block messages; upon detection, proxy is rotated.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding of proxy credentials in URLs, basic exception handling with print statements, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages proxies with embedded credentials, performs request handling with rate limiting, and switches proxies upon server signals. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Exception handling is minimal but not malicious. The proxy credentials are passed as parameters, not hardcoded. No obfuscation or malware is present. The security risk stems from credential handling, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting standard proxy management concerns without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate proxy request handler with rotation and rate limiting features. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The primary concern is secure handling of proxy credentials outside this code. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
