  "purpose": "Fetch and execute code dynamically from a remote server.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/' with custom header 'auth'.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code received from the remote server.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code from the source, response.json().get('code') extracts code, exec() executes this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on code fetched over the network, dynamic execution of remote code, presence of a suspicious URL and 'auth' header with unusual value.",
  "analysis": "The script makes an HTTP request to a potentially malicious URL, including a custom header. It then retrieves a JSON response and extracts a 'code' element. The code is executed directly via exec(), which is highly risky because it allows remote code execution. This pattern indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or other harmful activities. The use of a hardcoded URL and execution of remote code are strong indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it dynamically executes code fetched from an external server, which can lead to severe security risks including remote code execution, data theft, and system compromise.",
