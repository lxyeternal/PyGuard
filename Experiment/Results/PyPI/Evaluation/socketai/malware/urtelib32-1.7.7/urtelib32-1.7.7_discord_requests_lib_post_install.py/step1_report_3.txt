  "purpose": "Fetch and execute code from a remote server, potentially for dynamic functionality or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The requests.get call to 'http://wpp-api-vrv3.onrender.com/api/steal/1140884481671188581/' which retrieves data that is subsequently used.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function which executes dynamically retrieved code.",
  "flows": "Request to remote server -> response.json() -> extract 'code' -> exec(code) which runs the fetched code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on data fetched over network without validation; hardcoded URL and header 'auth' with unusual value '&&CD&&ON'.",
  "analysis": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to a specified URL with custom headers. It then extracts the 'code' field from the JSON response. If 'code' exists, it executes the code using exec(), which is highly risky as it allows remote code execution. The use of exec() on data fetched from an external source is a common pattern for malicious code, especially if the source is untrusted. The header value appears unusual and may be part of an obfuscation or a trigger. Overall, this pattern strongly suggests malicious intent or at least a dangerous practice, as it enables remote control over the executing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to executing remote code without validation. It can be used to run malicious scripts, backdoors, or malware, representing a serious security risk.",
