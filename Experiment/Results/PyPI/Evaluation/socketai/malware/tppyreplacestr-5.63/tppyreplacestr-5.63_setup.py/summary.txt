  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious, potentially malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, high obfuscation tactics, and silent error handling. It should be treated as highly risky and possibly malicious until further decoding and analysis of the payload."
