{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'types-for-adobe', including a custom installation command that executes a pre-install script.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration details; imports from 'setuptools' and a local 'pre_install' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'pre_install()' function call could potentially be a sink if it performs malicious actions, but without its content, it is unknown.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'pre_install()', then proceeds with standard installation; data flows from the pre_install script to the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The 'pre_install' script is invoked without any apparent validation or restriction; the URL and download URL are suspiciously non-standard or placeholders. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging tools and defines a custom installation command that executes 'pre_install()' before proceeding with setup. The pre_install module's behavior is unknown; it could contain malicious code. The package metadata appears normal but includes placeholder URLs. The structure itself is standard, with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. Without the content of 'pre_install', it's impossible to definitively identify malicious behavior, but the invocation of external scripts during install is a common vector for supply chain attacks if the script is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears legitimate but relies on an external 'pre_install' module whose content is unknown. If 'pre_install' contains malicious code, it could compromise the environment during package installation. The use of placeholder URLs and a custom install step warrants caution, but no explicit malicious behavior is identified from this code alone.",
