{
  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process for the 'types-for-adobe' package by executing a pre-installation script before proceeding with the standard installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import of 'pre_install' and the setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send data, but the pre_install() function (imported from another module) could potentially perform malicious actions; however, based solely on this code, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'pre_install', executing 'pre_install()' during the custom install process, then continuing with normal setup; no untrusted data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a custom install class that runs an external script ('pre_install') during installation is unusual and warrants scrutiny. The 'pre_install' script's content is unknown, so it could contain malicious code. The download URL is non-standard and not accessible, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install class that executes 'pre_install()', and then calls setup() with package metadata. The key anomaly is the execution of 'pre_install()' during installation, which could potentially execute malicious code if 'pre_install' is malicious or compromised. The setup configuration appears standard, but the external script's behavior is unknown. The non-standard download URL and generic description further increase suspicion, although no explicit malicious code is visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a standard setup script with an unusual pre-install hook that could execute arbitrary code from an external module. Without inspecting 'pre_install', the potential for malicious behavior cannot be ruled out. The package metadata itself is benign, but the execution of an external script during installation is a security concern.",
