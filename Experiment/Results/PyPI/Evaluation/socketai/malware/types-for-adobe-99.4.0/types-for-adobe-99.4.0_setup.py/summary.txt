  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears benign but executes an external script whose content is unknown. This external code execution poses a significant security risk, especially if pre_install() is malicious. The overall risk is high, and the malware score should be set accordingly. The code's structure is standard, but the external invocation warrants caution."
