      "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears benign but executes an external script whose content is unknown. This external code execution poses a significant security risk, especially if pre_install() is malicious. The overall risk is high, and the malware score should be set accordingly. The code's structure is standard, but the external invocation warrants caution."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows some suspicious features such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, and hardcoded secrets, indicating moderate security concern. However, no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The scoring is appropriate, with a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation around 0.3, and overall risk approximately 0.4. Continuous monitoring and further detailed review are recommended."
