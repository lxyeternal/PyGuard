  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote script during the pre-installation phase of a package.",
  "sources": "The remote URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobsygurtrude/dependencies/main/files/93nk3l2923k/823d2f39/dependencies.txt' via curl command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of './script.sh' via subprocess, which executes downloaded content potentially containing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Remote URL (source) -> curl downloads file -> chmod makes script executable -> ./script.sh executes -> removes script.sh.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of a remote script without validation or sandboxing, use of 'shell=True' with a complex command string, downloading and executing code at runtime, absence of error handling or verification of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function pre_install that constructs a shell command to download a script from a remote URL, change permissions to make it executable, execute it, and then delete the script. This behavior is highly suspicious because it involves executing external code without any validation, which could allow remote malicious actors to run arbitrary code on the host system. The use of 'shell=True' increases the risk of command injection. The remote URL appears to be from a GitHub raw link, which is common in malicious supply chain attacks. There are no security checks, content validation, or error handling present, indicating potential malicious intent or high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high risk of malicious behavior due to downloading and executing external scripts without validation, which could lead to remote code execution or system compromise. It should be considered unsafe and likely malicious.",
