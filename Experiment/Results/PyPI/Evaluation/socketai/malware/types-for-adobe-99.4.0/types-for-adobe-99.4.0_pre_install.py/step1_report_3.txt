  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes a script from a remote URL during pre-installation.",
  "sources": "The URL in the curl command: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobsygurtrude/dependencies/main/files/93nk3l2923k/823d2f39/dependencies.txt'",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via './script.sh' which could run malicious commands or code",
  "flows": "Download script from URL -> Save as script.sh -> Change permissions -> Execute script.sh -> Remove script",
  "anomalies": "Uses shell=True in subprocess, which is risky; downloads and executes remote code without validation; hardcoded URL; no error handling or validation of the script content",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a bash command that fetches a remote file, makes it executable, runs it, and then deletes it. The use of shell=True combined with a remote script execution presents a significant security risk. The URL is hardcoded and appears suspicious, as it downloads a potentially arbitrary script from a remote location. No validation, checksum, or sandboxing is present. The script could contain malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The code's purpose seems to be to run remote code during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes a remote script without validation, posing a high security risk and likely malicious intent. It can be used to run arbitrary malicious code on the host system.",
