  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote script during the pre-install phase.",
  "sources": "The bash command string, which fetches a script from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script ('./script.sh') via subprocess.run.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a shell command that uses 'curl' to fetch a script from a remote URL, saves it as 'script.sh', makes it executable, runs it, then deletes it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess.run, combined with executing a remote script fetched via curl, is highly suspicious. The remote URL is a raw GitHub URL, which could host malicious code. No input validation or verification is performed on the fetched script.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function pre_install that constructs a shell command string designed to download a script from a remote URL, set execute permissions, run it, and then delete it. The command is executed with subprocess.run using shell=True, which executes the command in a shell environment. This pattern is often used in malicious supply chain attacks or to run malicious payloads, especially since the URL is external and the script is executed immediately without any verification. The code’s purpose appears to be to run arbitrary code fetched from the internet during installation, which is a significant security concern. No safeguards, such as checksum verification or authentication, are present. This behavior indicates a high potential for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes a remote script without verification, posing a high security risk. It exhibits behavior typical of malicious supply chain attacks, and the use of shell=True with remote code execution is highly suspicious.",
