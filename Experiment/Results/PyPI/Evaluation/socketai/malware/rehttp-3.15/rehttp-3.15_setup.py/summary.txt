  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, indicating likely malicious activity. The package appears benign externally but harbors a hidden payload. The high scores assigned across reports are justified, and this package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further decoding of the payload."
