  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicative of malicious activity. The package setup code appears benign but is used as a cover for malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate and justified."
