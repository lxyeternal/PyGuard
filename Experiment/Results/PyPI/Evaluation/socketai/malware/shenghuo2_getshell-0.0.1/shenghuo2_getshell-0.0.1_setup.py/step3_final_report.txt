{
  "purpose": "Embed a reverse shell backdoor during package installation to establish remote control.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to hardcoded IP and port, within the run() method of CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of /bin/sh via subprocess.call, redirection of standard input/output/error streams to socket.",
  "flows": "Socket connection established during run(), streams redirected, then /bin/sh executed, providing remote shell access.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP and port, reverse shell activity triggered during setup, direct socket and subprocess usage without safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a socket to a remote IP, redirects standard streams to this socket, and spawns an interactive shell during installation, indicating malicious backdoor behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs actions typical of malware. The scores assigned (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1) are consistent with the observed malicious activity. The behavior poses a severe security threat, allowing remote system control. The code's intent is clear, and no assumptions are needed to confirm maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a high-severity malicious backdoor that establishes a reverse shell during installation. It is unequivocally malicious, with high confidence and risk scores justified by its behavior. Immediate removal and warning are recommended.",
