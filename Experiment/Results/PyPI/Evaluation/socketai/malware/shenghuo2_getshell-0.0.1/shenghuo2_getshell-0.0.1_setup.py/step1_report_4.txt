{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to create a Python package that, when installed, initiates a reverse shell connection to a specific remote server.",
  "sources": "socket connection to 39.101.72.63:4242, subprocess call to execute /bin/sh",
  "sinks": "socket connection for data exfiltration, subprocess call executing a shell",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers socket connection, which then opens a reverse shell by executing /bin/sh",
  "anomalies": "Code establishes a network connection to a specific IP during installation, executes an interactive shell, and overrides standard input/output/error streams, which is highly unusual and suspicious in package setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon package installation, opens a socket connection to a remote IP address and port. It redirects the standard input/output/error streams to this socket, then executes a shell, effectively creating a reverse shell. Such behavior is indicative of malicious intent or backdoor functionality embedded into a package. The presence of hardcoded IP address and the immediate execution of a shell during setup are strong signals of malicious activity. There are no input sources or user controls, and the setup does not follow normal package installation practices, reinforcing suspicions.",
  "conclusion": "This code embeds a reverse shell backdoor that activates during package installation. It is highly malicious, designed to allow remote control of the host system without user consent. The code is clearly malicious and should be considered dangerous.",
