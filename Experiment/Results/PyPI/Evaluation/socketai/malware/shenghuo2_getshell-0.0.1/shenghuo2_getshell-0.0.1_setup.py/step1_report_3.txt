  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The socket connection to 39.101.72.63:4242 and subprocess call to spawn a shell.",
  "targets": "The socket connection and subprocess spawn can lead to remote command execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "During installation, code opens a socket to the attacker's server, duplicates socket descriptors to stdin, stdout, stderr, and then executes an interactive shell, enabling remote control.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network connection and spawns a shell during the install process, which is unusual and suspicious behavior for a package installation script. The hardcoded IP and port suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class that, upon execution, establishes a network connection to a specific IP address and port. It then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket and launches a shell, effectively creating a backdoor. This behavior is not typical for a legitimate package and indicates malicious intent. The use of standard libraries like socket, os, and subprocess to perform these actions during installation is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to compromise systems post-installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior intended to create a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. The hardcoded IP address, socket connection, and shell invocation strongly suggest malicious intent, representing a significant security risk if used.",
