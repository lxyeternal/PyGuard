  "purpose": "Custom installation process that establishes a reverse shell connection during package installation",
  "sources": "socket connection to external IP and subprocess call to spawn a shell",
  "sinks": "socket connection and shell execution potentially executing arbitrary commands from remote server",
  "flows": "Upon running the install command, code connects to remote IP and port, duplicates socket to stdin/out/err, then spawns a shell",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of code executing network connection and shell during package installation; no user consent; hardcoded IP and port; reverse shell code embedded directly",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setuptools install process to include malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address and port, then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket. It subsequently spawns an interactive shell ('/bin/sh -i'), effectively creating a reverse shell back to the attacker-controlled server. This is a classic backdoor technique, enabling remote command execution. There are no obfuscations or misleading code constructs; the malicious intent is straightforward and embedded directly within the custom install method.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that, during installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior is highly malicious, as it allows remote command execution without user awareness or consent. The code clearly aims to compromise system security upon installation.",
