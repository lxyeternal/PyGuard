  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to create a reverse shell upon package installation",
  "sources": "The socket connection to an external IP and the subprocess call to spawn a shell",
  "sinks": "Connecting to external IP address, spawning a shell process that can receive input and output",
  "flows": "During installation, socket connects to 39.101.72.63:4242, then redirects stdin, stdout, stderr to the socket, and executes /bin/sh",
  "anomalies": "Code immediately initiates a network connection and opens a shell during setup, which is unusual and suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to include malicious steps. It establishes a socket connection to an external IP and port, then redirects the current process's input/output to this socket. Subsequently, it spawns a shell process that interacts over the socket, enabling remote command execution. These actions are highly indicative of malicious intent, specifically creating a backdoor for remote access. The code does not validate network responses or check for safe execution, further confirming malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, creating a hidden backdoor by establishing a reverse shell during package installation. It is designed to allow remote command execution, representing a serious security threat and should not be used.",
