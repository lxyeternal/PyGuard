  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon installation, establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "socket connection to 39.101.72.63:4242 and execution of subprocess with /bin/sh",
  "sinks": "os.dup2 calls redirecting socket to standard input/output/error, subprocess.call executing a shell",
  "flows": "Socket connection -> os.dup2 -> /bin/sh process",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior in a setup script that opens a reverse shell upon installation; hardcoded IP address and port; the reverse shell is executed automatically during install.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and extends the install command. During the custom run method, it creates a socket connection to a remote IP and port, then redirects the socket to standard input/output/error using os.dup2. Immediately after, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh) with subprocess.call. This behavior effectively creates a reverse shell back to the attacker's server every time the package is installed, which is malicious. The code contains hardcoded IP address and port, with no validation or encryption, and executes a shell directly, indicating malicious intent. No other third-party library usage appears suspicious, but the core logic is designed for remote access without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to create a reverse shell during installation. It clearly demonstrates malicious behavior with high confidence. The hardcoded IP and execution of shell process upon install strongly suggest sabotage or backdoor functionality.",
