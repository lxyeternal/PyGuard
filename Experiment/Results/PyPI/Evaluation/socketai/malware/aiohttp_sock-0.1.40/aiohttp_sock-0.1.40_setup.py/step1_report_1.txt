{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be setting up a Python package, installing dependencies, and executing a potentially malicious script via a VBS file, likely for persistence or unauthorized activity.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'USERPROFILE', reading version info from __init__.py, executing subprocess commands, reading hardcoded base64-encoded strings.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call executing pip installs and running a VBS script; writing to files in TEMP directory; executing a VBS script via Popen.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'USERPROFILE' → path setup → writing base64-decoded strings to files → executing VBS script in TEMP directory.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding base64 strings and writing to files with seemingly empty or suspicious content, executing a VBS script from a temporary directory without clear purpose, installing dependencies via subprocess calls. The base64 string in 'main.cpython-39.pyw' is empty, which is suspicious, and the VBS script content decodes to a script that runs 'WshShell' and executes a command with encoded base64, indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code installs dependencies necessary for network operations and potentially malicious activities, then decodes and writes base64-encoded scripts into a temporary directory, and executes a VBS script. The VBS script appears to run a decoded command, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts to hide payloads. The writing of empty or nonsensical base64 strings and execution of scripts from TEMP folder suggest potential malicious intent, such as persistence, hidden execution, or data exfiltration. The script’s purpose, combined with the obfuscated and suspicious file writes and execution flow, indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear signs of malicious intent, including obfuscated script execution, writing payloads into TEMP directory, and running scripts without user awareness. It is highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
