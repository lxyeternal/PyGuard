{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for creating and managing SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, especially proxy URLs, hostnames, ports, usernames, and passwords.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to network sockets for establishing proxy connections; connection objects are created and managed, with potential data flows over network sockets.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing extracts data (sources), which then flows into socket creation functions. Data flows over network sockets established for connecting to target hosts via proxies.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets. It performs standard parsing and connection setup. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscation or hidden logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for creating proxy socket wrappers and establishing network connections, either directly or through proxies. Proxy URLs are parsed to extract connection details. The functions handle typical parameters for network connection setup, including optional proxy configuration. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for asynchronous socket management. No suspicious or malicious code constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for establishing proxy-based network connections using SOCKS proxies. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are observed. The functionality aligns with standard proxy connection handling. Overall security risk is low.",
