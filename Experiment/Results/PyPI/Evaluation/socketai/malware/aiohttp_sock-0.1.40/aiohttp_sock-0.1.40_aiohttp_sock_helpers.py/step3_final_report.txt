  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating SOCKS proxy socket wrappers and establishing asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, input parameters for host, port, credentials, and proxy configuration",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection functions",
  "flows": "Parsing proxy URL -> Creating socket wrapper -> Connecting socket -> Returning asyncio connection",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio. It validates inputs, parses proxy URLs safely, and creates socket wrappers accordingly. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External inputs are handled with validation, but potential misuse depends on broader application context. The code relies on external libraries for proxy handling, which are standard. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with typical proxy connection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for SOCKS proxy connection management with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, primarily reflecting the inherent risks of handling untrusted inputs in proxy configurations, but no malicious activity is evident.",
