  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It involves parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections via `asyncio`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`, `asyncio`, `socket`) appropriately.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious activity.\n- High confidence (0.9).\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate.\n- No anomalies or suspicious logic.\n- The security risk is low, considering the code handles untrusted inputs but doesn't exhibit malicious intent.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with high confidence.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the previous analysis.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The code relies on external inputs, which could be malicious, but the code structure itself is safe.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- No change needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same overall conclusion.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- The code performs standard operations.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar conclusion.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code detected.\n- Functionality appears legitimate.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Also finds no malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower security risk score, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious intent, a risk score of around **0.1** is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a standard utility for SOCKS proxy connection handling.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only concern is potential misuse if untrusted inputs are provided, but this is inherent to proxy configuration code and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n**The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malware or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, primarily related to how inputs are managed externally, which is typical for such utility modules.**",
