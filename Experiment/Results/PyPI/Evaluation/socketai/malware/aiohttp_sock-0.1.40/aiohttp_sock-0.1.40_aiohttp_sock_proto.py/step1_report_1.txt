{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling with support for asynchronous networking, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from network sockets during the connect, negotiate, and address reading processes; also reads input parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include socket send/recv operations, address resolution, and authentication data handling. Sensitive data like credentials are handled, but not hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and authentication processes, then via socket connections to remote addresses; socket data is sent and received during negotiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code properly manages socket connections, with exception handling for network errors. No obfuscated code or malicious commands are present. Usage of dynamic code execution is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy protocols with asynchronous socket handling. It carefully manages socket creation, connection, and data exchange, including address resolution and optional authentication. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code does not perform any unauthorized system actions or covert data transfers. The use of external libraries is limited to standard asyncio and socket modules, with optional uvloop if available, which is typical and benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection handling with no malicious intent. It uses standard networking practices, with appropriate error handling and clear structure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious signals are detected.",
