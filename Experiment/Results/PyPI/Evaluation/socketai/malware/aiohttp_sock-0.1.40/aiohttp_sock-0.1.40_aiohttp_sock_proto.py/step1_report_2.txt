{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling, including negotiation, address resolution, and connection management for use in an asynchronous Python environment.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as hostnames, ports, user credentials, and internal socket and address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations (`sock_sendall`, `sock_recv`, `sock_connect`) where data, including connection requests and authentication details, are sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and request construction, then via socket send operations to the proxy server, followed by reception of server responses and connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are detected. No backdoors, malicious data leaks, or hidden network communications are present. The code relies on standard asyncio and socket functions and manages errors appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy protocols with proper input validation, error handling, and asynchronous network communication. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection setup per protocol specifications without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks are evident. There are no indications of malware or malicious backdoors. The code is well-structured for its purpose, using standard libraries and safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS proxy handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as expected for establishing SOCKS proxy connections in an asynchronous Python environment.",
