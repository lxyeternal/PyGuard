  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy client with asynchronous socket handling, supporting authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames and ports for destination and proxy server; socket responses during negotiation and connection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows primarily through socket send/recv operations; no evident data leaks or external command execution points.",
  "flows": "Source (host/port input) -> address resolution -> socket connection -> SOCKS negotiation -> data transmission",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant SOCKS proxy client implementation using asyncio. It manages socket connections, address resolution, and optional authentication correctly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or covert channels. The code structure is clear, with proper error handling and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent or behaviors. The security and obfuscation scores are appropriate and justified.",
