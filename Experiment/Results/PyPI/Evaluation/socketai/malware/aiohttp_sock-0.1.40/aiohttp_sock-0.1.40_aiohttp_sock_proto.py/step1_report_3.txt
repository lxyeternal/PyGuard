{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asyncio-based network communication, facilitating proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, username, and password parameters; address resolution via getaddrinfo; socket communication via sock_sendall and sock_recv.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to the proxy server and the remote destination; socket connections and address resolution are performed; potentially untrusted hostname and address data flow through socket operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flow into address resolution and socket connection functions; data is transmitted to the proxy and destination via _send; responses are read via _receive; authentication and connect negotiations process the data.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard proxy negotiation, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and patterns without suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of proxy socket wrappers with asynchronous support. It handles address resolution, socket creation, and proxy negotiation. Error handling appears standard, with specific exceptions for known proxy errors. No hardcoded credentials, no data exfiltration, no network communication with suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors are present. The code adheres to expected proxy behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asyncio, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily facilitates proxy connections with optional authentication. No malicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
