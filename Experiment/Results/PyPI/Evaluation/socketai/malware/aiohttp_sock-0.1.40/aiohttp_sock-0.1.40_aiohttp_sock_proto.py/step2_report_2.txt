  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the correctness of the issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/5 implementation, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. It uses standard libraries, handles errors appropriately, and does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, protocol-compliant, and lacks any signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with proper handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. The low risk score is appropriate given the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a SOCKS proxy socket wrapper, with standard handling, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscation, and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements proxy connection logic, with proper exception handling, no hardcoded secrets, no covert channels, and standard libraries.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the scores. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and proper handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **all scores are appropriate and consistent with the reports' reasoning**. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low risk, justified by standard implementation and lack of suspicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no security concerns or malicious signals.",
