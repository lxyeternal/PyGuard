  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4/5 proxy handling, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It uses standard asyncio and socket libraries, manages connections, and handles errors properly.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the functionality. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard protocol compliance, proper error handling, and no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. The code is a typical proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the socket wrappers with optional authentication, again highlighting the absence of hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. The risk score remains low, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a comprehensive asynchronous proxy connection handler, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, implementing SOCKS proxies with proper handling, no malicious signs.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or command execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of proxy code that handles potentially sensitive data and network connections. Given no malicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — moderate due to network handling but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the reports and code analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.15 — considering the potential misuse of proxy code but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
