  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, asynchronous SOCKS4/5 proxy implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code handles socket connections, address resolution, and authentication properly, with no suspicious behaviors. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed validation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is a straightforward implementation, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. No suspicious behaviors are detected, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Asynchronous proxy connection logic, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code, which appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Hidden Malicious Behaviors:\n\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscated or dynamically generated code.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, remote command execution, or covert channels.\n- Proper error handling and standard protocol adherence.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — the code is a standard, legitimate implementation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily because network code always carries some minimal inherent risk, but nothing specific here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent or behaviors. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified based on the detailed analysis.",
