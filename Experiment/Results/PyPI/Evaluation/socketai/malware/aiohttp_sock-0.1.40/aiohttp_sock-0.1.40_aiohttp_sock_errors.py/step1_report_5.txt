{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors for handling specific error conditions in a network application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions and exception hierarchy setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; exception classes do not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code solely defines exception classes without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a hierarchy of custom exception classes to handle specific SOCKS proxy-related errors. There are no data inputs, external data processing, or dynamic operations. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be part of a larger application and solely defines error types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception definitions for handling SOCKS proxy errors and has no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
