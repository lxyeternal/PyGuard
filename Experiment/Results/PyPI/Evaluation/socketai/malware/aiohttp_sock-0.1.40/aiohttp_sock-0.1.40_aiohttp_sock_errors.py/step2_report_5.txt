  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or logic beyond class declarations.\n   - The code is static and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n   - The summaries appropriately reflect the nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, no elevated risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus solely on the code's explicit content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as a precaution, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe, and transparent error handling component. No modifications to the scores are necessary, and no further security concerns are indicated.",
