{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources; only class definitions with exception inheritance",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, only class declarations and exception hierarchy",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; the code solely defines exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from base exception classes like Exception, OSError, and specialized proxy error classes. These classes are standard in Python for defining error types and contain no executable logic, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a clean, simple error hierarchy for handling SOCKS proxy related errors. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception hierarchy definition for SOCKS proxy errors and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and solely used for error handling within a larger application context.",
