  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data inputs, outputs, network operations, or complex logic are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.\n- The purpose and analysis in each report are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are comprehensive and consistent; they correctly identify that these classes are benign.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate: malware and obfuscated scores at 0, security risk at 0, as there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Suggestions for score adjustments:**\n- Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, the current scores seem reasonable.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified, as these are purely structural exception class definitions.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no security concerns. The scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No modifications needed; scores are appropriate.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Accept the current assessments; no further action required.",
