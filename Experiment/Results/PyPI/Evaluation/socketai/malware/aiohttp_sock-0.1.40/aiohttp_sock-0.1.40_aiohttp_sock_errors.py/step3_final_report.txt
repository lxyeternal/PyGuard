  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no data input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class declarations with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, noting the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's static, structural purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code aligns with standard error handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
