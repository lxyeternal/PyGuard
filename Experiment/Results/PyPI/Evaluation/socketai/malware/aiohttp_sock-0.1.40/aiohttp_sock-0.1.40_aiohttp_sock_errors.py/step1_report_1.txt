{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; exception classes do not perform any data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are used for error handling elsewhere, but no code here triggers or handles data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Exception class definitions are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No obfuscation, no use of untrusted inputs, and no external communication. This appears to be a benign, purely structural part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy-related errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It is a normal, safe component of an error handling module.",
