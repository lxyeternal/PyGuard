  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely defining exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or logic are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard error hierarchy setup.\n\n**Confirmations and potential issues:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet exactly; no issues are present in the class definitions.\n- Since the code is static class definitions with no runtime behavior, the likelihood of malicious activity is negligible.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is correct, given the lack of any suspicious or insecure constructs.\n- The purpose of these exception classes is standard in error handling modules.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Risk: **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the static, non-executable nature of this code, I concur with the provided assessments and scores.",
