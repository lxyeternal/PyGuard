  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, no output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of custom exception class declarations inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no input/output operations, no data flows, no use of untrusted data, and no suspicious logic. The class hierarchy is standard for defining specific error types related to SOCKS proxy errors. There is no obfuscation or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
