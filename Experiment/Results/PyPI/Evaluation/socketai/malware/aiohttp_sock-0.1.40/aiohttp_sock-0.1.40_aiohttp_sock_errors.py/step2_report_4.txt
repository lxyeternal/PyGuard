  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data inputs, outputs, network operations, or logic are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and purely structural.\n\n**Confirmation of code presence:**\n- The code matches the description: it defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it is purely declarative.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None are evident. The code is standard for error handling modules.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's nature—no malicious or obfuscated content, and high confidence in benignity.\n\n**Risk assessment justification:**\n- Since the code is only class definitions for error handling, the risk score should remain very low (close to 0).\n- No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The malware score should stay at 0; no malicious activity is suggested.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" or \"error handling\" but do not specify any actual security flaws.\n- The assumption that exception class definitions are inherently safe is correct here.\n\n**Consistency check:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's function.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The overall security risk remains at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and serves error categorization purposes.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The assessments across reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores and acknowledge the code as a non-threat component of the larger system.",
