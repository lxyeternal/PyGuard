{
  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures",
  "sources": "None; code only defines exception classes without data input or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist; code solely declares exception classes without logic or data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors; straightforward class declarations",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from standard exception classes. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. The classes serve to categorize specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining custom exceptions for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code is benign and intended for error categorization.",
