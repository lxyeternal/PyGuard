  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- They consistently note the absence of data processing, external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The confidence level is uniformly high (1), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n- The code appears to be a benign, standard error handling component.\n\n**Confirmations & Validity:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: it only defines exception classes with no logic, data input/output, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n- Risk score: 0 also makes sense given the above.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree, and the code is purely structural, there's no basis for higher scores.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The current scoring and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
