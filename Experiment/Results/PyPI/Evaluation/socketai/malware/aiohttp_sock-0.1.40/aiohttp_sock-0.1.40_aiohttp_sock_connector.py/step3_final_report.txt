{
  "purpose": "Implements a customizable aiohttp proxy connector supporting HTTP/HTTPS proxies with optional DNS resolution override and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy_type), external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), and user-supplied proxy URLs.",
  "sinks": "URL formation for proxies, socket connection establishment, request proxy updates, and socket creation via external helpers.",
  "flows": "Proxy parameters are used to construct proxy URLs and socket wrappers; socket connections are established and passed to the parent connector; proxy URLs are parsed from user input and used in request updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. External helpers are used but appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with standard handling of proxy URLs, socket creation, and connection management. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Proxy credentials are passed as parameters and embedded into URLs, which is typical but should be handled securely in deployment. External helper functions are presumed safe; their security impact depends on their implementation. The code's logic aligns with best practices for proxy handling, and no vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The scores in the provided reports are consistent with this assessment. No adjustments are necessary.",
