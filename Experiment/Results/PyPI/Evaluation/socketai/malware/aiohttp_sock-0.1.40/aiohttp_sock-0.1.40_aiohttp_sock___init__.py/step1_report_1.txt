{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components related to a proxy connection library, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code segment",
  "flows": "Imports and exports data within the module, primarily static data and class/function definitions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, mainly defining imports, module version, and export variables. It imports classes and functions from local modules and re-exports them, which is standard practice for a package's __init__.py file. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The absence of network operations, dynamic code, or cryptographic secrets reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initializer for a proxy-related Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks based on the provided content.",
