{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports, constants, and exports for a proxy-related Python package, setting up dependencies and exposing key classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; only module structure and exports are defined",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily handles importing and exporting components",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script. It imports specific classes and functions from local modules, sets a version string, and defines what symbols are exported. There are no network operations, no data processing, or any dynamic or reflective code that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's init file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
