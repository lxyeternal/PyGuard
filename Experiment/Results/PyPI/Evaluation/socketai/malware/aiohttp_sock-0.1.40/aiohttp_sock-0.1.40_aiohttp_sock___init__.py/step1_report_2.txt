{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to proxy connections, providing classes, errors, helpers, and protocol definitions for proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ variable.",
  "targets": "None explicitly; the code mainly imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process external input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward module setup and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module-level imports and exports, defining available classes, constants, and functions for proxy handling. It includes standard error definitions and helper functions. No input reading, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer for a proxy handling package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages imports and package exports without performing any data processing or external interactions.",
