  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a straightforward module initializer with no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. Obfuscated is 0, consistent with the clear import/export pattern. Risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning appears sound. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup without suspicious activity.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware is 0, consistent. Obfuscated is 0, appropriate. Risk is 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard import/export module with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. Obfuscated is 0, consistent. Risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusions are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—module setup with no suspicious code or behavior.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware is 0, matching the analysis. Obfuscated is 0, consistent. Risk is 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable and well-justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also a benign module setup with no malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, consistent. Obfuscated 0, consistent. Risk 0, justified.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final System Assessment:\nGiven the uniformity and the nature of the code—simple import/export setup with no runtime logic, no network activity, no cryptography, no obfuscation—the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's content. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious intent or security risk. The code appears to be a standard, benign module initializer for a proxy handling library.",
