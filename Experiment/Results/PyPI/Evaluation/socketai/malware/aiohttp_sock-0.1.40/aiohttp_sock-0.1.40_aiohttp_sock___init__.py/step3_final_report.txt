  "purpose": "Module initializer for a proxy connection library, importing and exporting components.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string, __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements and exports; no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module setup file, importing classes, functions, and constants from local modules and defining exports. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, cryptographic secrets, or obfuscation. All five reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
