{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module imports, constants, and exports for a Python package related to proxy connections, likely for handling SOCKS proxy communication.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present in this fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted inputs are observable; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected; the version string is standard, no obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of import statements, a version declaration, and an __all__ export list. It does not process user input, handle external data, or execute dynamic code. No indicators of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of a larger library focused on proxy handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This source code fragment is benign, containing only module setup and export declarations without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
