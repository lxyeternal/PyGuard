  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for handling proxy connections, including importing various components such as errors, helpers, and protocol types related to proxy operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions are evident in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data are observable in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is primarily import and export definitions without runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports various components from local modules. It does not execute any logic or handle data directly. No source-to-sink flows, no suspicious or malicious code constructs, and no unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple interface or package initialization file for a proxy-related library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and poses no security risks based on this snippet.",
