{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions, environment variables, or files (not explicitly shown in the snippet). No explicit source of untrusted data identified.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or executes system commands if present, but no such operations are visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., inputs, environment variables) to sinks through various functions, but no explicit flow is observable in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. No obfuscation or suspicious language features detected. Lack of context makes it difficult to identify malicious intent definitively.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any explicit malicious operations such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification. It appears to be a straightforward utility or data processing script. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or anomalies are visible. However, without complete context or the entire code, minor malicious components cannot be definitively ruled out. No obfuscation, suspicious imports, or dynamic execution methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The code seems benign but the lack of full context means a low-confidence assessment.",
