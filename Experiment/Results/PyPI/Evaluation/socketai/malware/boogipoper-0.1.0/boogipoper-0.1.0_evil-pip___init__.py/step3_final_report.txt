  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input/output, data handling functions, imported libraries, potential data sources such as environment variables or network endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system calls that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, files) via code logic; no suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports lack actual code snippets, limiting detailed analysis. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the evidence, though they could be conservatively lowered to 0 given the lack of code. Confidence levels are high where code is reviewed, and appropriate where no code is provided. No anomalies or red flags are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the assessments are consistent and reasonable. Unless new code or context emerges, no adjustments are necessary.",
