  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command.",
  "sources": "The os.system call within the CustomInstallCommand.run method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a bash command that initiates a reverse shell connection to a remote IP and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes the reverse shell command, connecting to 114.116.119.253 on port 7777.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a reverse shell command embedded in the post-install script is highly unusual and suspicious for a standard package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup and overrides the install command with a custom class. This class's run method first executes the standard installation process, then executes a system command that opens a reverse shell connection to a remote IP. This behavior is typical of malicious payloads designed to establish remote access without user consent. The rest of the setup configuration appears normal, with no other suspicious code. The reverse shell command is clearly malicious, indicating intent to create unauthorized remote access.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code in the form of a reverse shell command executed during installation, which is a serious security risk. The rest of the code appears legitimate, but the embedded malicious behavior warrants immediate caution and disapproval.",
