  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "os.system call in the CustomInstallCommand.run method.",
  "sinks": "os.system command execution, specifically executing a bash command to establish a network connection.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes an OS command that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to run a bash reverse shell command during install is highly unusual and suspicious for a package installation script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines a custom install class that extends the standard install. In the run method, after the normal installation, it executes os.system with a command that initiates a reverse shell connection to IP 114.116.119.253 on port 7777, which is indicative of malicious activity. This behavior could allow remote control of the system upon package installation. The setup() function registers this custom command, meaning any installation of this package will trigger the reverse shell attempt.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that creates a reverse shell connection during installation. This is a clear security threat, as it could enable remote access without user consent. The presence of this code indicates malicious intent or severe security negligence.",
