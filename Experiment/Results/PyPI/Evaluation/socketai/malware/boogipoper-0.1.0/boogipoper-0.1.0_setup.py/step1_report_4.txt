{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom install command that executes a potentially malicious command after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and defines a custom install command; the malicious activity is embedded in the run() method of CustomInstallCommand.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that establishes a reverse shell connection to an external IP, which is a malicious sink.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method is invoked, which executes the os.system command, creating a flow from package installation to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes overriding the install process to run a network connection to an external IP, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The use of a reverse shell in the install script is abnormal and malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a package with standard metadata but includes a custom install command. This command runs a system call that opens a reverse shell to an external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777, which is a common tactic for remote code execution and backdoor access. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no other suspicious elements. The malicious code is embedded directly into the post-install process, indicating intentional malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious activity designed to establish a reverse shell upon installation. This is a serious security threat, and the package should be considered highly dangerous. The malicious code is obfuscated in its purpose but clearly intended for remote access.",
