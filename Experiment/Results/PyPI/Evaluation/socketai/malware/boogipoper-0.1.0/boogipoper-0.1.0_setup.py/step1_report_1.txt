{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines the installation process for the 'boogipoper' package, with a custom install command that executes post-installation code.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and executes a system command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a bash command that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external IP address.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes os.system with a reverse shell command, establishing outbound network connection to 114.116.119.253:7777.",
  "anomalies": "The os.system call contains a reverse shell command, which is highly unusual and suspicious in a package installation script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules and defines a custom install class that extends the standard install command. After running the standard install process, it executes os.system with a bash reverse shell command, connecting to an external IP address and port. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, as it allows remote control of the host system upon package installation. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious activities or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior in the form of a reverse shell command executed during installation, indicating potential compromise of the target system. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
