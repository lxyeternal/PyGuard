{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that customizes the install process.",
  "sources": "The custom install class 'CustomInstallCommand' overrides the run method, specifically the os.system call that executes a command during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a bash command that attempts a reverse shell connection to an external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run method executes the reverse shell command, which connects to an external server, potentially allowing remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The os.system call runs a reverse shell command embedded directly in the code, which is highly unusual and suspicious for an installation script.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation, executes a bash reverse shell to an external IP. This behavior is malicious, as it creates a backdoor on the host system during package installation. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The code does not include hardcoded credentials, but the reverse shell command itself is a clear malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious. It intentionally opens a reverse shell connection during installation, which can compromise the host system. This package contains a hidden backdoor.",
