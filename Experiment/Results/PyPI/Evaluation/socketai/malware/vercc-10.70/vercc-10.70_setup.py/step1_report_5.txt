{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'vercc' Python package, including some potentially malicious background activity.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system (os.path.exists), executing shell commands via subprocess.Popen, importing setup from distutils.core.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation with encoded PowerShell command, potentially executing hidden code.",
  "flows": "os.path.exists check → subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command → setup function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command that likely executes obfuscated code, silent try-except blocks that suppress errors, no license specified, and suspicious code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setup from distutils.core, then attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, which suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The try-except blocks suppress errors, preventing easy detection of failures. The setup function for the package appears normal but is wrapped in a try-except block, which could hide issues or malicious modifications. The code’s structure, especially the encoded PowerShell command, indicates intent to run obfuscated, possibly malicious code silently. No explicit malicious actions are confirmed, but the suspicious code patterns and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package but contains obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently in the background, which could be malicious. The obfuscation and silent error suppression are suspicious and warrant caution.",
