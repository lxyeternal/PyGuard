      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, with concealment tactics and error suppression. While definitive payload analysis is lacking, the pattern aligns with malware or backdoor activity. The security risk and malware scores should be elevated accordingly."
