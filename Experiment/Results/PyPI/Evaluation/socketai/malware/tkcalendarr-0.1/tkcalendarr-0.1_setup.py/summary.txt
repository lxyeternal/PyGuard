  "conclusion": "The script, while superficially a setup configuration, contains multiple signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, including heavy obfuscation, system privilege checks, and covert system modifications. The high obfuscation score (~0.9), malware likelihood (~0.8), and security risk (~0.85) are justified. It is strongly advised to avoid executing or trusting this code without thorough manual or sandbox analysis."
