  "purpose": "The code appears to perform routine data processing or utility functions with no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "sources": "Data input functions, environment variables, or external data sources (not explicitly provided).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points, network connections, or file writes (not explicitly provided).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks without evident malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high, and scores reflect low risk. Given the lack of actual code snippets, the assessments are based on summaries, which are reasonable. Minor uncertainty exists due to limited context, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate. Slightly increasing malware suspicion to 0.1 across all reports adds a conservative buffer without contradicting the evidence.",
