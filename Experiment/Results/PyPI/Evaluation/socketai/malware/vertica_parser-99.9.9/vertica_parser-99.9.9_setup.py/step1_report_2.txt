{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package and executes a custom command during installation, development, or egg info phases that sends encoded data to a DNS server, potentially for covert data exfiltration or command and control communication.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), and os.getcwd() functions, then serialized to JSON and encoded into hex strings for transmission.",
  "sinks": "The code sends DNS requests via the dns_request function, which constructs and transmits DNS packets containing the encoded data chunks, to a potentially malicious domain (ns1.uchpuchmak.lol).",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current directory) -> JSON serialization -> hex encoding -> data chunking -> DNS request construction -> DNS request transmission to ns1.uchpuchmak.lol.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration over DNS, which is unusual for a package described as a simple proof of concept. The domain used ('uchpuchmak.lol') is suspicious. The package description claims no malicious intent, which appears to be a misleading cover story.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a DNS request function that constructs and sends DNS packets with embedded data. During installation, development, or egg info commands, the custom_command is invoked, collecting system information and encoding it into chunks, which are sent via DNS requests to a specific domain. This behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or command and control communication, which is a malicious activity. The package's declared purpose and description do not align with its actual behavior, indicating potential malicious intent. The code uses standard libraries for system info collection but leverages DNS protocol to transmit data covertly. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the DNS exfiltration is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains code that performs covert data transmission over DNS, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. Despite the benign description, the actual behavior suggests malicious intent aimed at data exfiltration or remote command control.",
