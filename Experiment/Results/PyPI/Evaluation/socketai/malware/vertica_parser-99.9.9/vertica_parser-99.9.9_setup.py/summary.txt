  "conclusion": "The package actively performs covert data exfiltration via DNS during setup commands, contradicting its benign description. The behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting a malware score close to 0.9 and a high security risk score (~0.8-0.9). It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, and further investigation is recommended."
