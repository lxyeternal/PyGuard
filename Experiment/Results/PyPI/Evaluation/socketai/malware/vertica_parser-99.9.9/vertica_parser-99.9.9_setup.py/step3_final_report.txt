{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and transmits it covertly via DNS requests during package setup commands to a specified domain, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - system info collection; json.dumps() - data serialization",
  "sinks": "dns_request() function which sends crafted DNS packets over UDP to a remote domain",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, serialized, hex-encoded, split into chunks, then each chunk is embedded into DNS query names and sent via DNS requests to the domain uchpuchmak.lol",
  "anomalies": "Use of manual DNS packet crafting for data exfiltration, embedding encoded system info during setup commands, misleading package description claiming benign purpose",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during setup phases by encoding system info into DNS queries sent to a suspicious domain. The DNS request function constructs raw DNS packets, indicating intentional covert communication. The package description falsely claims benign intent, which is inconsistent with the active exfiltration behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-1, risk ~0.8-0.85) are justified given the covert data transfer. The code is not obfuscated but employs encoding techniques that serve to hide its activity. Overall, the behavior is malicious in nature, representing high suspicion of data theft or covert communication.",
  "conclusion": "The package actively performs covert data exfiltration via DNS during setup commands, contradicting its benign description. The behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting a malware score close to 0.9 and a high security risk score (~0.8-0.9). It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious, and further investigation is recommended.",
