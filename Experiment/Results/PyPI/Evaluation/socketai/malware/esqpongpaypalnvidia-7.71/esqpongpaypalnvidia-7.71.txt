      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be considered malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms benignity. The package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged for removal or detailed analysis."
