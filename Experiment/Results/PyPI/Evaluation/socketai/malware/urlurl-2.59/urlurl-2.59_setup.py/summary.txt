  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of malicious intent through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package installation. The setup code itself is benign, but the preamble suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify a high security concern, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
