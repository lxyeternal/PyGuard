  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, primarily due to the obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup. The high obfuscation, stealth, and conditional execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting a high malware score (~0.8) and security risk (~0.85). Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions, but current evidence indicates a serious security concern."
