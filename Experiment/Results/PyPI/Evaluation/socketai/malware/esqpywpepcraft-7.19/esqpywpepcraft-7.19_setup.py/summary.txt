  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, covert PowerShell commands executed conditionally, with external URL references and error suppression, strongly indicating malicious activity. Given the obfuscation, external communication, and stealthy execution, it warrants a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8. The obfuscation score is also high at 0.8. The overall assessment suggests this package is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, requiring further decoding of the payload and cautious handling."
