{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error definitions, and helper functions for establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto; no external input sources are explicitly read within this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data handling operations are present in this code fragment; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code imports components that may later be used in source-to-sink flows within the larger project, but no such flows are present here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are observed in this snippet. All imports and definitions are standard for a modular Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports from local modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the package. No code executes at runtime other than imports, which do not constitute data flow or malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or potentially malicious constructs. The structure and content appear typical for a Python package module intended for proxy connection handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard, benign part of a proxy connection library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The package likely performs proxy-related functions in the broader project, but no harmful activities are evident here.",
