{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and functions from other modules, and exports them for public use, likely forming part of a proxy handling library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident; the code primarily imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports and exports. It imports classes and functions related to proxy connections and errors, then exposes them via __all__. No user input handling, data processing, network communication, or other risky operations are present. The code structure suggests standard package scaffolding. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign part of a larger proxy-related library module. It serves as an index or facade for importing necessary classes and functions. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
