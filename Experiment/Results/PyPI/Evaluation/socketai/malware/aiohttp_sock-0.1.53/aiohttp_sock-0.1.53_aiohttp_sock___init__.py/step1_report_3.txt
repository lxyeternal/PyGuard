{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a package initialization file that imports various classes, functions, and constants related to a proxy connection system, likely for handling SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and predefined constants; it does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code only defines imports and exports for the package.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is primarily an import and export module without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python module conventions. No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various components from local modules such as connector, errors, helpers, and proto, then defines versioning and exports. It functions as a package __init__.py file, setting up the namespace for the package. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs here. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. The code is minimal, clean, and follows standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to organize imports and define the module interface. There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
