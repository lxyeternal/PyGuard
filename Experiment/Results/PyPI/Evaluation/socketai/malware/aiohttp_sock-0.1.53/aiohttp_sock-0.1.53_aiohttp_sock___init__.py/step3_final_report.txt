{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or interface for a proxy handling library, importing and exporting relevant classes, functions, and error definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports components from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code only establishes namespace exports; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package setup script, importing various components and defining exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is zero, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with its role as a benign module initializer. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious module setup with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
