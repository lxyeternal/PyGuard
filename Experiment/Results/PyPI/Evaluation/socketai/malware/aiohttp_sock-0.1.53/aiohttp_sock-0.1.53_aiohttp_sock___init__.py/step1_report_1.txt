{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and export components related to proxy connections, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy types, likely for use in a network communication library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the module's own version string.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data are present; no code reads user input or external data sources directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is observed in this snippet; it primarily sets up exports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The version string is a standard semantic version.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports components from local modules and defines an export list. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling that could be malicious is present. It is a straightforward setup for a proxy-related package, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy handling library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and focused on defining exports for other components.",
