{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and expose classes, functions, and constants related to a proxy connection handling library, specifically SOCKS proxy support.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities; no input/output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up imports and exports; there are no data flows, input handling, or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The version string is standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an interface or API module, exposing classes and functions for proxy connection management. It imports specific components and re-exports them for external use, with no data processing, input handling, or network operations within this snippet. The structure and content are typical of a library setup file, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward, benign setup file for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and does not process untrusted data. It serves as an organized interface for the underlying proxy functionality.",
