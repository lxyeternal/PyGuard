{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating network connections through a proxy server with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as host, port, username, password, and input data provided for socket communication.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over the network via socket, especially in _send and negotiate functions; resolution of addresses; socket connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into socket request construction, then through _send to the proxy server, which responds and the data is received back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious IP addresses or domains; no obfuscated or overly complex code patterns; all code appears to follow expected network proxy communication protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, with functions for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 negotiation, address resolution, and socket management. It properly handles network connections, authentication, and address types. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is present. The structure adheres to standard practices, with no suspicious code anomalies or obfuscated patterns. The use of external libraries is minimal and justified by their purpose, and no dangerous or malicious functions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be safe and intended solely for proxy network communication.",
