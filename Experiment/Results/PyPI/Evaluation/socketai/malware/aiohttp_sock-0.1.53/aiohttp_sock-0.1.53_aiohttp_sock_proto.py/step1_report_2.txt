{
  "purpose": "This code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, used for establishing proxy connections in network applications.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, user credentials, and address resolution via getaddrinfo and socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations (_send, _receive, sock_connect), especially data sent over sockets, and address resolution that may handle untrusted host inputs.",
  "flows": "Host and port data flow from input through address resolution to socket connection and SOCKS handshake; data from untrusted sources (hostnames, user credentials) flows into socket send operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. The code performs standard network proxy negotiations without suspicious logic or obfuscation. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client connections using asyncio. It handles address resolution, negotiation, and authentication according to protocol specifications. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors are evident. The functions use appropriate error handling, and the data flow is consistent with typical proxy client logic. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or obfuscated code are present. It relies on standard libraries and conventions without dangerous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs expected network operations securely and transparently, with appropriate error handling and protocol adherence.",
