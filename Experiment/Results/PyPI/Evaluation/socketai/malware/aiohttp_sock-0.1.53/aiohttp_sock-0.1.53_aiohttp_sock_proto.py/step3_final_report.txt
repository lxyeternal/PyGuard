  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames, ports, user credentials, and address information for proxy negotiation and connection.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations where data is sent or received, potentially exposing data or causing network effects if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user parameters through address resolution, authentication, and proxy negotiation to socket connection and data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious IPs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Code is clear and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols with proper error handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, protocol-compliant nature of the code. No anomalies or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score appropriately reflects the potential network exposure without indicating any malicious activity.",
