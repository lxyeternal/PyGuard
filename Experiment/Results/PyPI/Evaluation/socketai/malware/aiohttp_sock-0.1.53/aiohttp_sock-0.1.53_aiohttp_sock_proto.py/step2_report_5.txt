  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers; no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard protocols.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code matches the description: standard, protocol-compliant, no suspicious activity.\n- The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Malware score of 0 aligns with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent, no issues. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Asynchronous SOCKS4/5 client wrappers; standard implementation; no backdoors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code adheres to standard practices.\n- No suspicious behavior or code patterns.\n- The very low risk score (0.1) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy client wrappers; address resolution, authentication, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- All behaviors are typical for such proxy clients.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores align.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers; standard implementation; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears legitimate.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- Risk and malware scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy client wrappers; no malicious behavior, proper error handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk score reflects a low threat level.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is consistent with the descriptions; no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are evident.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - Malware score of 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious payloads or behaviors are present.\n  - Obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n  - Risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the standard, non-malicious nature of the implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, given the functionality and no evident security concerns.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent with the code, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the implementation. No adjustments are necessary.",
