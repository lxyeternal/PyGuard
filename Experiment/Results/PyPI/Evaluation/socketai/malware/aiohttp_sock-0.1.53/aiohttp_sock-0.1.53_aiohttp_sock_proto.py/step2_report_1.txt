  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, handling connection, authentication, and address resolution. No suspicious or malicious activity is identified.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, given it's proxy code with potential network exposure but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is standard, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard implementation, no malicious behavior, and proper error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy client code with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate, considering network operations and potential attack surface.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, appropriate for such code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None identified; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0 in all cases; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0; code clarity is maintained.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0 but low, reflecting the potential network exposure but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the nature of proxy code, but acknowledging possible network exposure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious intent.  \n- Scores reflect low risk and no malware.  \n- The overall security posture based on these reports is sound.",
