  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard proxy client code. No issues or suspicious patterns are noted.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is appropriate. Security risk 0.2 seems reasonable given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no malicious activity, and proper protocol adherence. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is justified. Security risk 0.1 aligns with the low threat profile.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with proper error handling and no suspicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is appropriate; risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client code, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; the code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is justified; low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0 is appropriate; security risk is low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, implementing SOCKS proxies correctly.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None identified. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the code's nature. The risk scores are low, reflecting the typical use of such proxy code.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** No suspicious assumptions or vulnerabilities are evident. The code handles errors properly and doesn't contain hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, standard implementation.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the nature of proxy code, which could be misused if misconfigured, but not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Maintain malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and set a conservative security risk score around 0.1, considering the potential misuse of proxy functionality but acknowledging the code's benign nature.",
