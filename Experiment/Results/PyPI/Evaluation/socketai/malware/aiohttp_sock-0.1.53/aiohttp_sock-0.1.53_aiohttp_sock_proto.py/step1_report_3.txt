{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and authentication mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user ID; address resolution via getaddrinfo; data received from proxy server responses.",
  "sinks": "Data sent to proxy servers (_send method), socket connect calls, and socket data reception; potential points where untrusted data could influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, credentials) flows into connection and authentication requests; responses from proxy servers are received and processed, potentially influencing control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard library socket and asyncio modules; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no hardcoded credentials; exception handling appears standard. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is directly evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements SOCKS proxy connection logic, including address resolution, authentication, and handling server responses. Error handling is present, raising exceptions on invalid responses or connection issues. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected. The code relies on external errors module for exception types, but these are standard and not suspicious. The data flow is primarily for network communication, typical for proxy client implementations. No malicious payloads, covert channels, or data leaks are apparent. The code structure is clear and adheres to expected asynchronous network programming patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous Python applications, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected network proxy operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
