      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and demonstrates malicious behavior, including obfuscated payloads, external script execution, and network functions that could facilitate remote control, backdoors, or data theft. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified by the decoded content and observed behaviors, indicating a high probability of malware presence and severe security risk."

The potential security risk is minimal and related to user-controlled inputs, which is typical for such utilities. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign characteristics."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector with configurable options. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The only minor concern is the DNS resolver override, which could be exploited but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context."
