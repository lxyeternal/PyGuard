{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating and managing SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing asynchronous network connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (e.g., socks_url, host, port, username, password), URL parsing via parse_proxy_url, and socket connection methods.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence socket connection parameters, proxy configuration, or URL parsing, but no direct data leakage or malicious data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> parse_proxy_url (if socks_url provided) -> create_socket_wrapper -> sock.connect -> asyncio.open_connection / loop.create_connection with sock.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials detected. The code performs standard proxy connection setup. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing proxy connections, with functions for parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers for SOCKS4/SOCKS5, and asynchronously connecting to target hosts. It handles user inputs securely, raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs, and uses well-defined libraries. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors are present. It does not contain obfuscated code or hidden functionalities. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for proxy-based network connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical network utility for establishing proxy connections, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations securely without suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
