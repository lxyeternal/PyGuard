{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as raw_url, host, port, username, password, and optional socks_url. It also reads from environment-like configurations such as default proxy addresses.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from parameters (like socks_url, host, port, username, password) is used to configure network connections. The code creates sockets and makes network connections, which could potentially be exploited if malicious input is provided, though no direct data leakage or harmful commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (socks_url, host, port, credentials) flow into URL parsing, socket creation, and connection functions. Data from socks_url is parsed into proxy configuration, which is then used to establish a socket connection, ultimately leading to network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for establishing network connections via proxies. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The only notable aspect is the reliance on user-provided URLs and parameters for network setup, which is typical for such utility functions. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to parse proxy URLs and create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies. It supports dynamic proxy configuration via URLs, and uses asyncio for asynchronous network connections. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is straightforward, handling network setup cleanly. It does not contain any data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious behavior. Its design is consistent with typical proxy connection utilities, and all external inputs are used as parameters without evident misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It handles input parameters securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. Therefore, it is considered safe based on the provided code fragment.",
