  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The potential security risk is minimal and related to user-controlled inputs, which is typical for such utilities. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign characteristics."
