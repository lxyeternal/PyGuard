  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Functions for parsing proxy URLs (`parse_proxy_url`)\n- Creation of socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 (`create_socket_wrapper`)\n- Asynchronous functions to establish connections via proxies (`open_connection`, `create_connection`)\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- Uses standard libraries (`asyncio`, `socket`, `yarl`) and custom proxy classes (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`)\n- Input parameters are user-controlled, but this is typical for proxy configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues** are evident in the code itself. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation for establishing proxy connections.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified**. The code validates inputs properly, raises exceptions for invalid data, and does not contain any obvious bugs or security flaws.\n\n### Score review and justification:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious activity, no hidden payloads, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Justification:** The code only manages proxy connections; it does not perform any malicious operations.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct—there's no obfuscation.\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- The reports assign low scores (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n- **However**, since the functions accept untrusted URLs and parameters that influence network behavior, a slightly higher score could be justified if considering potential misuse. But in the context of the code alone, these are typical features, not vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **No malicious behavior**: The code does not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n- **Input handling**: While user input influences proxy configuration, this is standard and not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential misuse**: If an attacker supplies malicious proxy URLs or hostnames, they could direct traffic maliciously, but this is a typical risk in proxy utilities, not a flaw.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 (slightly cautious, but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### Overall estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The potential security concern is typical for such utilities—misuse by malicious actors—but this does not reflect a vulnerability or malicious code in itself.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The report's scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed. The overall security posture based on this code is low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
