  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, user credentials from URL or function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection functions, network socket creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port, credentials) influence socket wrapper creation, which then connects to target host/port, leading to network connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for setting up proxy connections using asyncio. It validates inputs, parses proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers for SOCKS4/5, and establishes connections. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The use of user-controlled inputs for proxy configuration is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The exception handling and input validation are appropriate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a typical utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The potential security risk is minimal and related to user-controlled inputs, which is typical for such utilities. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign characteristics.",
