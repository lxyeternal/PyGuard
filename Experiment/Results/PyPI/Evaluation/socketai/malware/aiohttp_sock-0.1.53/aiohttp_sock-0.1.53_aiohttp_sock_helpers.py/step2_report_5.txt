  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections.\n- The code parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4/5, and establishes asynchronous connections.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on user-supplied input for proxy configuration, which is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Malware score:* 0\n- *Obfuscated:* 0\n- *Security risk:* 0.1\n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the fact that user input influences connection parameters, which is expected. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Malware score:* 0\n- *Obfuscated:* 0\n- *Security risk:* 0.2\n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame as above, the analysis is consistent. The security risk is marginal, considering potential misuse of user inputs, but no actual malicious behavior is present. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Malware score:* 0\n- *Obfuscated:* 0\n- *Security risk:* 0\n- *Confidence:* 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is clear and thorough. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, justified by the use of user input for proxy configuration, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Malware score:* 0\n- *Obfuscated:* 0\n- *Security risk:* 0.2\n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with prior assessments. No malicious activity detected. The risk score is appropriate given the potential for misuse, but no actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Malware score:* 0\n- *Obfuscated:* 0\n- *Security risk:* 0.2\n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame conclusion as others. No malicious intent or obfuscation, standard proxy connection utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall analysis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.1–0.2) due to reliance on user input for proxy configuration, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments correctly reflect the code's behavior.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minor, typical risks associated with user-controlled parameters)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores appropriately reflect the code's safety profile.",
