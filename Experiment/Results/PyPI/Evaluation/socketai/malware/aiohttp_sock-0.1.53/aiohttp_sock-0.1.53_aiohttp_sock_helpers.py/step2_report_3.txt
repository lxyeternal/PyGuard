  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously.\n- It includes URL parsing, socket wrapper creation for SOCKS4/SOCKS5, and connection functions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- Input parameters are validated appropriately.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and third-party modules (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`), which are typical for such tasks.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code appears correct, well-structured, and secure in its current form.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None detected. The functions handle inputs securely, validate parameters, and perform expected proxy connection setup.  \n  Minor note: The exception handling for URL parsing could be more robust (e.g., handling missing user info), but this is not a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern about user-controlled input influencing network connections. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.  \n- **Overall risk scores:** They are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The only possible concern is that user-supplied proxy URLs and connection parameters could be exploited for malicious purposes if used maliciously (e.g., connecting to malicious hosts). But this is inherent to any network utility accepting user input and does not imply malicious code within the utility itself.\n\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to reliance on user input for network parameters, which is standard for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented utility for SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The provided scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the input-driven nature, 0.1 is acceptable)\n\n**Final verdict:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe and legitimate.",
