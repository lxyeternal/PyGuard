{
  "purpose": "The code appears to prepare a Python package setup, install dependencies, generate, and execute obfuscated scripts possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading package files, reading version info, and reading hardcoded base64-encoded scripts.",
  "sinks": "Executing obfuscated scripts with subprocess.Popen, installing packages via subprocess calls, and writing/reading encoded scripts and binaries.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, file reads, hardcoded base64) -> decoding and writing obfuscated scripts -> executing obfuscated scripts via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded scripts that decode into potentially malicious code, dynamic installation of dependencies, writing and executing obfuscated scripts, obfuscated code structure, execution of external script files at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup with dependency installation, then proceeds to decode several base64-encoded scripts into files. These scripts include potentially malicious code that, when executed, may perform harmful actions such as data collection or remote command execution. The code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding, dynamic script creation) to hide its true intent. The final step runs a VBScript file that creates and runs a shell object to execute another script, which is typical of malicious persistence or remote control tactics. The decoded scripts include functions to collect system info, perform network requests, and execute code dynamically. The use of environment variables and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent. No safe or benign behavior is evident, and the dynamic execution of encoded scripts constitutes a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple signs of malicious activity, including decoding and executing obfuscated scripts, dynamic package dependency installation, and runtime execution of external scripts via subprocess. The purpose appears to be establishing persistence, executing malicious scripts, or controlling the host system. Overall, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
