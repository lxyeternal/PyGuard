  "security_risk": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and demonstrates malicious behavior, including obfuscated payloads, external script execution, and network functions that could facilitate remote control, backdoors, or data theft. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified by the decoded content and observed behaviors, indicating a high probability of malware presence and severe security risk."
