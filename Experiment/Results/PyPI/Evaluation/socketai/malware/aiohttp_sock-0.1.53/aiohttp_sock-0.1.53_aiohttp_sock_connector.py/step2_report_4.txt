  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes proxy setup, URL parsing, and socket handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; data flows into socket creation and URL formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; resolver could be misused but seems intended.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior. The use of NoResolver to bypass DNS could be exploited to hide DNS queries, but within typical proxy contexts, it’s benign.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.2. These seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope, emphasizing standard proxy configuration, socket creation, and URL assembly.\n- No suspicious code or secrets; external modules are assumed legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1–0.2, which align with the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the no-resolver and proxy URL parsing.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard socket handling.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2, consistent with a benign proxy setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights standard proxy connection handling, user parameters, and socket creation.\n- No signs of malicious activity; external helpers presumed legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar overview, emphasizing configurability and socket handling.\n- No suspicious behaviors or secrets; standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic behaviors.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only notable aspect is the use of `NoResolver`, which bypasses DNS resolution. While this can be exploited to hide DNS queries, in the context of a proxy connector, it’s a legitimate feature for scenarios requiring DNS resolution control or privacy.\n\n### **Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slight concern due to DNS resolver bypass, but not a serious security flaw; it’s a configurable feature, not an exploit.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with configurable options. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident, and the use of a custom resolver, while potentially exploitable if misused, is within normal proxy configuration practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with a minor note on the DNS resolver override. I recommend maintaining the current low risk score and malware assessment.",
