  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described concerns, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements a proxy connector with customizable proxy URL, support for different proxy types, and a no-resolver class to bypass DNS.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- The code relies on external modules (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) whose behaviors are assumed standard.\n- The use of `create_socket_wrapper` and custom resolver could be exploited to hide DNS queries or manipulate network behavior, but in the absence of malicious intent or suspicious code, these are standard techniques.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard proxy connector with no malicious behavior. It notes the potential misuse of the custom resolver to hide DNS queries but considers it benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware score aligns with the lack of malicious code. The security risk is modest due to the resolver override, which could be misused but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code. No suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The very low security risk reflects the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on the proxy handling and socket creation, again noting no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The use of user-provided parameters is standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights the standard proxy connection setup, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, emphasizing the configurability and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the potential misuse of the custom resolver to hide DNS queries, but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The use of `NoResolver` could be exploited to conceal DNS queries, which is a concern in certain threat models. However, this is a known technique and not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The external dependencies (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are assumed to be standard and secure.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at **0.2** for the overall potential misuse, but note that this is a low-level concern rather than a direct vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                      |\n|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                              |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, no obfuscation detected.                              |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2     | Use of custom resolver to hide DNS queries could be exploited, but not inherently malicious. |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with configurable options. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident from the provided code.",
