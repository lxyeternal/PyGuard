  "purpose": "Provides a configurable proxy connector for aiohttp with support for custom DNS resolution and proxy URL handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy type, host, port, username, password; external functions create_socket_wrapper and parse_proxy_url; class properties.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, URL formatting, proxy request updates.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → proxy_url property and _wrap_create_connection method → socket creation and connection → request update and connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NoResolver to bypass DNS resolution, which could be exploited to hide DNS queries; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard proxy connector with optional DNS bypass via NoResolver. No malicious code, backdoors, or secrets are present. External functions are assumed legitimate. The use of custom resolver could be misused but is a known technique. No obfuscation detected. Scores reflect low malicious potential and minor security concern due to DNS resolution bypass.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector with configurable options. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The only minor concern is the DNS resolver override, which could be exploited but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context.",
