  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector with configurable options. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The only minor concern is the DNS resolver override, which could be exploited but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context."
