  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements a proxy connector with a custom DNS resolver and proxy URL handling. No malicious behavior is evident; the only concern is the resolver that could be misused to hide DNS queries.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The custom resolver could be exploited to conceal DNS activity, but this is a legitimate use case in some scenarios. The code itself is standard proxy handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a potential misuse of the resolver. The risk score is low, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing proxy configuration and socket handling. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is standard for proxy setup, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy connection handling, including no-resolver and socket creation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code. The use of create_socket_wrapper is standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard proxy connection setup with user-supplied parameters.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy connection implementation, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with configurable proxy URL, optional DNS resolution bypass, and socket wrapping. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting potential misuse of the custom resolver to hide DNS queries, but this is a known, legitimate feature rather than malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (a slight concern due to resolver override, but not malicious)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, considering the code's functionality and potential for misuse.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector implementation with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the custom DNS resolver, which could be exploited to hide DNS activity, but this is a known and sometimes necessary feature in proxy setups. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
