  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Socks proxy operations and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input sources; these are class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring; these are exception class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The classes are straightforward and serve as error types.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Socks proxy errors and authentication issues. There are no data input/output, network connections, or logic that could be exploited. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of a larger error handling framework. The lack of data processing or dynamic execution reduces concern for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as error handling scaffolding without any suspicious behavior.",
