{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network communications, or untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; this is purely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, serving as custom error types for SOCKS proxy handling. There are no data input, output, or logic flows. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, can be inferred from class definitions alone. The structure is straightforward and adheres to typical Python exception class patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard exception class definitions used to handle specific SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks present. It appears to be boilerplate error handling code.",
