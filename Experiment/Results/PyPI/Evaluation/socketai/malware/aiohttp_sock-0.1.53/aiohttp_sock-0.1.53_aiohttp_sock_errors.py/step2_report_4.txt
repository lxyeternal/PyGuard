  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely defining custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No dynamic behavior, input/output, data processing, or network interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the static, structural nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in a larger codebase.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is correct, given the code is clear and readable.\n- Security risk score: 0 is justified, since no vulnerabilities or security issues are introduced by such class definitions.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Flaws:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no issues are present.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without basis.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is standard boilerplate for exception handling.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- No malicious or security concerns are evident.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling in network-related modules. The scores and analysis provided in all reports are accurate and justified.",
