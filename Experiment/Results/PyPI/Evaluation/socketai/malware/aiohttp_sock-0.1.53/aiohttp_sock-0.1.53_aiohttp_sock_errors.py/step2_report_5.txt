  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic behavior, input/output, or malicious code.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves as error handling scaffolding.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's harmless nature.\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus on the code's static structure and its purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Summary of My Own Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- No dynamic, network, or data processing logic exists.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided reports are accurate and comprehensive. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
