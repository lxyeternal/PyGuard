{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; all classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, no untrusted data handling, no output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows, no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple exception definitions with no logic or data handling; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. There are no functions, no data manipulation, and no external interactions. This is typical for defining custom exceptions for error handling in a larger codebase. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code appears purely structural, serving as a foundation for other components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code only defines custom exception classes with no logic, input/output, or data handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is standard for exception handling and does not contain any malware or obfuscation.",
