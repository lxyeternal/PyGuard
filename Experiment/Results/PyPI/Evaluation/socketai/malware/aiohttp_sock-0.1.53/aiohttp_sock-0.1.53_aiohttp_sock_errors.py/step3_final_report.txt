  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and network error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions, no data flow or execution path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors, all inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no functions, dynamic behaviors, network operations, or data processing. The code is simple, readable, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The exception classes serve as error handling scaffolding, with no embedded logic or external interactions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign and static nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, consisting solely of exception class definitions for error handling in network modules. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, structural nature.",
