  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy connections and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; classes are solely for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation; class hierarchy is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or security-sensitive actions present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is evident. The purpose appears to be to facilitate error handling for SOCKS proxy operations, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for network proxy error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
