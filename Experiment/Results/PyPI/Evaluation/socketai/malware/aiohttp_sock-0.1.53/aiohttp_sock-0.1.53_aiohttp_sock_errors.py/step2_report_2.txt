  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, specifically tailored for SOCKS proxy and network error handling. All classes are static, straightforward, and contain no logic, data handling, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n\n**Yes.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**\n\n**No.**  \nThe reports consistently describe the code as simple exception class definitions, with no anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks. Their reasoning aligns with the code's static, structural nature.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores given to each issue and their reasonableness**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious code is present.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which matches the code's nature.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n**No.**  \nSince the code is purely structural, with no logic, data handling, or external interactions, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware score considerations**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \nThe malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity, code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n**None.**  \nAll reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply state that the code is benign exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n**Yes.**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all are 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Overall assessment and personal estimate**\n\n**My assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard exception class setup)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nWhile the code is harmless, it’s always good to note that exception class definitions are foundational and typically not risky unless combined with malicious logic elsewhere. Since no such logic exists here, the scores should remain minimal.\n\n---\n\n## **Final conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code but acknowledges that it’s a foundational component in error handling, which by itself does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation.  \n- The reports correctly identify the nature of the code.  \n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.  \n- No further action needed unless additional context suggests otherwise.",
