  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code and the evaluation criteria.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe provided code defines multiple custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues. All classes inherit from standard Python exception types, and there are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only contains static class definitions for exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly conclude that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. They also correctly note the absence of anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Any overestimations or underestimations?**  \n  The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code. The security risk score is also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk of 0, which is justified because the code only defines exception classes with no security implications.\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports have a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is only for exception definitions, which is accurate.  \n- No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are implied or detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be boilerplate exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the nature of the code as harmless exception class definitions. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, safe, and non-malicious.",
