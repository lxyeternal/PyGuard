  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, or network interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, safe, and purely structural.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The classes are simple exception subclasses, correctly defined.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No data flow, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware score: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - Security risk score: 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - These scores seem appropriate and justified given the code.\n\n3. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are just exception classes without logic or data handling.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are made.\n   - No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code are present.\n\n4. **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification needed for higher scores since there's no evidence of risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- All scores are consistent and justified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There is no indication of malicious activity or security issues in this code snippet.\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the simplicity and the nature of the code, no further action or concern is necessary.",
