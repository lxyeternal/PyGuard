{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only defines exception classes without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None, since no data handling or processing occurs within these class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there are no functions or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior present in class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations for SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard set of custom exceptions to handle network proxy errors. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. Overall, it is safe and typical for network error handling.",
