  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'downrun' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, description, dependencies, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – primarily static metadata configuration, no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Long description content seems minimal but benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package info and dependencies without executing or including malicious code. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The long description is trivial, and no runtime code is executed beyond package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
