  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata without executing any code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Description string 'downloads and runs a file' is misleading but not implemented in code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no executable logic, network activity, or dynamic code. The description string suggests malicious intent but is only a descriptive label. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores in reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk due to misleading description but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only concern is the misleading description string, which does not translate into actual malicious behavior. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk minimal (around 0.1) to account for the misleading description. Overall, the package is safe and does not pose security threats.",
