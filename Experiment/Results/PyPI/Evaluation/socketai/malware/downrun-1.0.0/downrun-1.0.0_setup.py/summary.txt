  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only concern is the misleading description string, which does not translate into actual malicious behavior. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk minimal (around 0.1) to account for the misleading description. Overall, the package is safe and does not pose security threats."
