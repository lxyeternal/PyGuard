  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for 'downrun'.",
  "sources": "Static code analysis; no runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the script solely sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any suspicious or unusual code patterns; minimal content with basic setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines package metadata (name, version, author info, description), and configures package setup with find_packages() for inclusion. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or potentially malicious constructs. The package appears to be a straightforward setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
