{
  "purpose": "Download a file from a specified URL using the curl command via os.system.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'file' which is expected to be a URL string.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a shell command that includes the 'file' parameter.",
  "flows": "The 'file' parameter flows directly into the shell command, which is executed without sanitization, leading to potential command injection.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly inserts the 'file' parameter into a shell command without validation or sanitization, which can be exploited for command injection. There is no input validation, escaping, or sanitization of the URL.",
  "analysis": "The function 'get' takes a URL as input and constructs a shell command to download the file using 'curl'. Since the 'file' parameter is directly interpolated into the shell command string, an attacker could supply a malicious URL or command to execute arbitrary shell commands. There are no safety checks, sanitization, or constraints implemented. This behavior poses a significant security risk, as it can be exploited for remote code execution via command injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high security risk due to unsanitized use of external input in a shell command, enabling potential command injection. It lacks safeguards and can be exploited for malicious purposes such as remote code execution.",
