      "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only concern is the misleading description string, which does not translate into actual malicious behavior. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk minimal (around 0.1) to account for the misleading description. Overall, the package is safe and does not pose security threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The import statement alone does not pose a security risk, and the scores are appropriate. Vigilance should be maintained regarding the behavior of the 'downrun' module in broader context, but from this snippet, the security posture is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code contains a critical security vulnerability due to unsanitized input leading to command injection. The reports accurately assess this, and the scores reflect the severity. No malware is present, but the vulnerability could be exploited maliciously. The overall assessment is that the code is insecure and should be fixed by adopting safer subprocess usage and input validation."
