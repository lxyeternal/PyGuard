{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "User inputs or external data include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and addresses resolved via DNS or IP parsing, primarily in methods such as _resolve_addr, _build_dest_address, and the constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include socket data transmission in _send, sock_recv, and negotiate functions, especially when handling user-provided hostnames and credentials, and when sending or receiving data over sockets.",
  "flows": "Input data from hostnames and ports (sources) flows into address resolution and request building, then is transmitted over sockets; responses from proxies are read and interpreted, potentially affecting control flow if errors or malicious data are received.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code utilizes standard socket operations, DNS resolution, and protocol negotiation; no unusual obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy negotiation with proper exception handling and resource cleanup. It performs DNS resolution, socket communication, and protocol adherence per SOCKS specifications. No signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, hidden network connections, or sabotage mechanisms are present. It follows typical patterns for proxy client implementations without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious intent. It manages connections securely and handles errors appropriately. There are no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malicious behavior within this code segment.",
