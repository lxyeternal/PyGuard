{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, handling proxy negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Inputs include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and network addresses from method parameters and class attributes. Data is read from network sockets during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions, especially during negotiate() methods and address resolution, which could potentially leak data or be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Hostnames and credentials flow into the address resolution and authentication procedures; data read from sockets during negotiation and data transfer could be influenced by network responses or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network addresses are present. The code uses standard socket and asyncio methods without obfuscation. Exception handling is thorough. No indicators of malicious backdoors or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy clients supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with asynchronous socket handling. It manages address resolution, authentication, and communication with the proxy server. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are observed. The code handles errors securely and does not process or log sensitive data in an unsafe manner. Usage of standard libraries and conventions reduces suspicion. The absence of hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated constructs suggests it is legitimate and intended solely for proxy communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to expected protocols and security practices for proxy connections.",
