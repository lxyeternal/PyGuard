  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard SOCKS4/5 implementation with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, risk is 0.2.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. The scores seem reasonable.  \n- **Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct handling, no hardcoded secrets, and standard protocols. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9, risk 0.2.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no suspicious behavior, mentions standard handling, and assigns malware score 0, confidence 0.95, risk 0.2.  \n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n- **Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions: legitimate SOCKS proxy client, no malicious behavior, standard practices, malware score 0, confidence 0.9, risk 0.2.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.  \n- **Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Assessment:** The most conservative, still concluding no malicious activity, standard implementation, malware score 0, confidence 0.95, risk 0.1.  \n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the descriptions in all reports; no malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- **Error detection:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risk in handling network proxies, but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n- **Obfuscation:** Confirmed as 0 in all reports, consistent with the code transparency.\n- **Potential assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; all conclusions are based on code review.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature and the review.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to network handling complexity, but no vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
