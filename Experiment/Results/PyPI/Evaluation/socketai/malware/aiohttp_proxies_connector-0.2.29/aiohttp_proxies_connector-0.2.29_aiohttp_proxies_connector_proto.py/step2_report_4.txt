  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and handles network operations securely. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct protocol handling, no malicious behavior, and standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client with proper handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality; no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—standard implementation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious elements detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1) reflects minimal concern, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the reasoning supports that the code is benign. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, this is appropriate; the code handles network operations securely, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2, justified based on the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes are necessary.**",
