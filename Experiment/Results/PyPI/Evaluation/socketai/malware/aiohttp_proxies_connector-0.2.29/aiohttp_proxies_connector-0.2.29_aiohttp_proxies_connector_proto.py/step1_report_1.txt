{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing asynchronous network connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters for host, port, user credentials, and data received from network sockets during negotiate and connect procedures.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the network socket for connection requests, authentication, and data transmission; receives data from the network socket for server replies and address information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> network socket send/receive during authentication and negotiation -> connection establishment to target address.",
  "anomalies": "Code handles address resolution and network communication securely; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed. The code uses standard libraries and methods for network operations without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based network operations. It includes functions for address resolution, protocol negotiation, authentication, and connection management. All data flows involve standard socket operations and proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation without signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It functions to facilitate proxy connections securely and appropriately, with no evident malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
