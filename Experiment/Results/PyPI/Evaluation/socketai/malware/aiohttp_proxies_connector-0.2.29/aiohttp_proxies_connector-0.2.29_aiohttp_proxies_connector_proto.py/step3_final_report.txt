  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client for network communication through proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data from socket connections, host resolution via getaddrinfo, user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Sending and receiving data over network sockets, potentially untrusted data from remote servers or DNS resolution.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket or DNS -> processed in protocol negotiation functions -> data sent/received via socket send/recv -> potential data leaks or malicious payloads if present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Protocol handling appears standard and correct.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies using asyncio, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Data flows follow expected patterns for proxy negotiation and data transfer. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Given the absence of malicious indicators, the malware score is set to 0. The code's clarity and adherence to protocols justify an obfuscated score of 0. The inherent network operations pose low risk, but due to potential network-based vulnerabilities, a low risk score (~0.2) is assigned. Confidence in these conclusions is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It adheres to standard protocols, handles errors appropriately, and does not contain obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified based on the analysis.",
