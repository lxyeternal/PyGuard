  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the code's function—implementing SOCKS4/5 proxies with standard socket operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, uses standard libraries, and handles data securely.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identifies the code as SOCKS proxy wrappers with standard network data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly notes the code's function and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly summarizes the code's function.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Slightly lower risk, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward, protocol-compliant implementation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clean, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to network operations, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- It follows standard patterns for asynchronous SOCKS proxy clients.\n- No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage signs are evident.\n- The high confidence levels across reports support the benign interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — Slightly elevated due to network operations, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
