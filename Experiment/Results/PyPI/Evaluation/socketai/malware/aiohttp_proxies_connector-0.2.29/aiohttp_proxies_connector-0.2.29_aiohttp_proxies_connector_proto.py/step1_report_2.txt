{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous connections, including negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports for address resolution, user credentials for authentication, and data received from remote SOCKS proxy servers.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into socket send functions, especially in the negotiation and authentication processes. Data from the proxy responses are read and processed for connection confirmation.",
  "flows": "Hostnames or IP addresses are resolved and sent to SOCKS proxy servers during connection setup. Authentication data (user credentials) are sent to the proxy if provided. Responses from the proxy are read and validated to confirm successful connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. Use of standard libraries and correct handling of network protocols. The code appears to be a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementation supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, optional remote DNS, and authentication. It employs standard socket and asyncio features, with proper exception handling and validation of server responses. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code follows typical patterns for network proxy handling, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or suspicious anomalies are evident. It adheres to expected protocols and practices for proxy negotiation and data handling.",
