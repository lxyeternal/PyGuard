{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for network communication, including connection, negotiation, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data from hostnames, ports, user credentials, and address resolution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive operations, including sending connection requests and receiving proxy responses.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication methods to network send functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; the code appears to follow standard proxy communication protocols. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Error handling is standard, and no suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It uses asyncio for asynchronous socket operations, with proper error handling for connection issues and protocol mismatches. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or command-and-control communication. The use of standard protocols and libraries reduces suspicion. No hidden or malicious activities are evident. The code functions as expected for a proxy client library, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without malicious intent. It follows standard protocol procedures and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is safe for use in network applications requiring proxy support.",
