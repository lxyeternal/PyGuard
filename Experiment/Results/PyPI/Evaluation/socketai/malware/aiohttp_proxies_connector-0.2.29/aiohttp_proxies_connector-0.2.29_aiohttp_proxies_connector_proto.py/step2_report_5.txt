  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 client implementation with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a typical implementation. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score seems appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard behavior, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears legitimate. The analysis is consistent with the code structure. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. No hidden threats detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with the code. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (lower than others, reflecting minimal concern)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound, and the low risk score is justified given the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None apparent; the code handles errors properly and follows protocol standards.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the reports' assessments. Risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is cautious and consistent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard implementation, no vulnerabilities)\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
