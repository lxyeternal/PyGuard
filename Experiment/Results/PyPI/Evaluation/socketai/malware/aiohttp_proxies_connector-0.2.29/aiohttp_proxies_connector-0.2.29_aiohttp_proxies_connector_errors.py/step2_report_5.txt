  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of dynamic code, data processing, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code. Similarly, the obfuscated score is 0, reflecting no obfuscation. The security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis that these are harmless class definitions.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code's purpose is purely to define exception classes, which is a common pattern in Python.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All claims are based on the code content, which is straightforward. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states that the code is harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. They appropriately reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — The code is standard exception class definitions with no security risks.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. There is no need to adjust scores upward. The code is benign and standard for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current scoring accurately reflects this.",
