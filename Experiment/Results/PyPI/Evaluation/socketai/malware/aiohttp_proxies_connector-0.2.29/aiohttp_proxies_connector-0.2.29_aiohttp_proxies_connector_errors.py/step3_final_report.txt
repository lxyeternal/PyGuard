  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; purely static class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, data processing, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no dynamic or malicious elements. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for error handling, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
