{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class declarations with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations for SOCKS proxy error handling, inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. The class hierarchy appears standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code's simplicity reduces the risk of hidden malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of simple, well-defined custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be standard code for error handling in a proxy-related library.",
