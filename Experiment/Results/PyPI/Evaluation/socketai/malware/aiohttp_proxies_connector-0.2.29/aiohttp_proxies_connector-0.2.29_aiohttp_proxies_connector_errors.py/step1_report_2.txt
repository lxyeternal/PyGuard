  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions with no data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external communication; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behavior observed. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no external data inputs, no processing, and no output mechanisms. The classes are used to represent specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations. The structure is standard and does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
