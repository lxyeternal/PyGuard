  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code, data handling, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Scores and Justification:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no executable or malicious content, the overall risk score should be very low, close to zero.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is benign, which is justified given the content.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk profile accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The overall assessment should be that this code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present. The current report scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
