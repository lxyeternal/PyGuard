  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or obfuscation. The code appears standard and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flows, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity. Similarly, the obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk scores are also 0, which is reasonable. The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince all analyses conclude no malicious or suspicious behavior, there is no justification for increasing the risk scores above 0.5. The code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nThe malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on the code's structure, which is purely exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is standard exception hierarchy for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior is present.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores and assessments are appropriate. The code is benign, and no changes are necessary.",
