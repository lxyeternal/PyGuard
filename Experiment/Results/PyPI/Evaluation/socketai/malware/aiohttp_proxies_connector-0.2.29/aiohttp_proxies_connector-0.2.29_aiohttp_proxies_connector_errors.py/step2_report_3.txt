  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - No dynamic code, data handling, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is just exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there's no malware.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n- Confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is clear and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scoring is appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary based on this code snippet.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
