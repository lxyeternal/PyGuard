  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no dynamic elements, data processing, or malicious code present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and straightforward. They do not identify any flaws or suspicious patterns. Given the simplicity of the code, this assessment appears accurate.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior is evident.  \n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.\n\n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on the benign nature, no elevated risk scores are justified. The code is purely for error handling and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content. No malicious payloads or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to factual analysis based on the code provided.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, these scores are appropriate. The reports correctly identify that this is standard exception class code with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a security risk score of zero.",
