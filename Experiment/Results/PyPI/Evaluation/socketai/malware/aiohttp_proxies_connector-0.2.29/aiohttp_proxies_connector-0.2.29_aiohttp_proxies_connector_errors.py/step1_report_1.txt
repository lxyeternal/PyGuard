{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows, no source-to-sink paths, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, including exceptions for authentication issues, server reply problems, and connection errors. All classes inherit appropriately, and there are no dynamic code, data handling, or malicious constructs present. The structure is typical for defining exception hierarchies in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
