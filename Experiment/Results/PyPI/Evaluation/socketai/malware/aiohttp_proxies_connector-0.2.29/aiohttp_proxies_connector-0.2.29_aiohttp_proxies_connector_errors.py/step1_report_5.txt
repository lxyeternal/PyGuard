{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; only class definitions with no dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink paths as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from standard exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares custom exception classes for various SOCKS proxy and connection errors without any executable logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The classes serve as error types for use elsewhere in an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, providing structured error handling.",
