  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; all are class definitions for exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths; no data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows; code solely defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of straightforward class definitions without hidden or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors. These classes inherit from standard exception types and do not contain any executable code, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The structure is standard for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, harmless code with no malicious intent.",
