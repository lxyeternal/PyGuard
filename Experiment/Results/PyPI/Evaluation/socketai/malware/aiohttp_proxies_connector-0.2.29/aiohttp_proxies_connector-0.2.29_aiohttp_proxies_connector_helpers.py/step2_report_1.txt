  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs.\n- Creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.\n- Establishes network connections via these proxies asynchronously.\n- Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on external, presumably trusted, socket wrapper implementations.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Correctly notes that network connections are established via asyncio, which could be misused if URLs are malicious.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No suspicious code, no secrets, straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions.\n- No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified, consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Highlights standard handling of proxy connections.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar conclusions: standard proxy connection utility.\n- No malicious intent, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same pattern: legitimate proxy connection setup.\n- No signs of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, no obfuscation present.\n- **Security risk score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious intent, a score around **0.2** seems reasonable, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n**The current scores are appropriate and justified.** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy connection utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is low, and the malware/obfuscated scores are correctly set at zero.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
