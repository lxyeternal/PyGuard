{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create network connections through SOCKS proxies using asyncio, supporting URL parsing and proxy socket creation.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function parsing URLs, open_connection and create_connection functions accepting user input parameters for proxy URLs, host, and port.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection calls using socket wrappers, potentially sending untrusted data over network connections.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details from user input, which is then used to create socket wrappers; these wrappers connect to proxy servers and relay data, ultimately leading to network socket creation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The code performs standard proxy connection setup, with no unusual or misleading patterns. The use of unquote for URL parsing and the assumption that only SOCKS proxies are used appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a network utility for establishing proxy connections using asyncio and custom socket wrappers. It securely parses user-supplied proxy URLs, avoiding hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors. All operations are typical for a proxy connection setup, with proper exception handling for invalid inputs. No obfuscated code, malicious network behaviors, or suspicious data leaks are detected. The functions do not perform any data collection, exfiltration, or harmful system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for setting up SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio applications. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. It correctly handles input validation, uses standard libraries, and does not contain malicious patterns. The overall security risk is minimal, with no active malicious behaviors observed.",
