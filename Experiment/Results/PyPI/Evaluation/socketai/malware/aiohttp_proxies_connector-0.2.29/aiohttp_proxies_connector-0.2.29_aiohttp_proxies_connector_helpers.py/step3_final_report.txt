{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, and establish asynchronous network connections via these proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy URL string in parse_proxy_url; input parameters for host, port, proxy URL, and connection details.",
  "sinks": "Establishes network connections through asyncio's open_connection and create_connection using socket wrappers.",
  "flows": "Parses proxy URL -> creates socket wrapper -> connects to proxy -> forwards connection to target host/port.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External classes assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and async connection establishment. Validation is appropriate, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. External dependencies are assumed to be standard. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (~0.2) and malware score (0) are justified. Overall, it poses minimal security concern.",
