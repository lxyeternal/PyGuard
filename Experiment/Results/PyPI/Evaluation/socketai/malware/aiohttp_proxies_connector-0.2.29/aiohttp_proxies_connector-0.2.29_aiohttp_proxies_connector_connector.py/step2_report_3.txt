  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard proxy connection utility with no malicious intent. It constructs proxy URLs, manages socket connections, and handles proxy credentials securely.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is low, justified by the fact that proxy credentials are handled properly and no malicious code is present.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n**Verdict**: The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The analysis aligns with the code.\n- Proxy credentials are externally supplied, not hardcoded.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Describes the code as a flexible aiohttp proxy connector, handling proxy URL parsing and socket management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code relies on user inputs and external functions, but nothing malicious is evident.\n- Proxy URL construction and socket wrapping are standard.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict**: The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the implementation of custom proxy resolver and connector classes, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code appears standard.\n- No malicious behaviors.\n- External functions are unverified but seem standard.\n\n**Verdict**: The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Highlights support for no-resolver scenarios, proxy URL parsing, and external functions `parse_proxy_url` and `create_socket_wrapper`. Notes potential risks due to reliance on external functions.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The caution about external functions is valid; their security isn't verified.\n- The code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n- Proxy credentials are passed externally, which is typical.\n\n**Justification for scores**:\n- Malware remains zero, as no malicious code is present.\n- Obfuscation is zero.\n- Security risk is low, but the reliance on external functions introduces some uncertainty; however, no direct malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict**: The scores are reasonable. Slightly lower confidence (0.8) reflects the external dependency concern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's content and analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: **0.2** (low, standard proxy handling with external inputs)\n\n**Additional notes**:\n- The only potential concern is the external functions `parse_proxy_url` and `create_socket_wrapper`. If these are malicious or insecure, they could introduce risks, but within the scope of the provided code, no malicious activity is evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical, well-structured proxy connector implementation without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
