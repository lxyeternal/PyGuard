  "purpose": "Provides an implementation of proxy connection handling for aiohttp, including URL parsing, socket wrapping, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL construction, proxy credentials and parameters, external functions `parse_proxy_url` and `create_socket_wrapper`",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, proxy URL usage in requests",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) → proxy URL construction and parsing → socket creation and connection → request proxy update and connection establishment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external functions without verification introduces some uncertainty",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, handling URL formation, socket wrapping, and connection logic. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External functions are used but not provided, which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. Proxy credentials are handled via parameters, not hardcoded. The logic is standard and secure for its purpose. The security risk is low, primarily due to external dependencies and input handling, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. External functions should be verified for security in deployment, but within this scope, the code is safe.",
