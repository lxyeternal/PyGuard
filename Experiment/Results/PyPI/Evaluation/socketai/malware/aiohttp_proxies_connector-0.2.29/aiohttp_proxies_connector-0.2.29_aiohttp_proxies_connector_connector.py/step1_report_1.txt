{
  "purpose": "Provides an HTTP proxy connection class with support for custom resolver and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy configuration data from class properties and method parameters, including proxy URL parsing.",
  "sinks": "Uses proxy credentials and URL to create socket connections; potentially could leak credentials if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL is constructed from user-supplied data; connection methods use this URL and proxy credentials to establish connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a proxy connector that constructs proxy URLs from user input or parameters, then establishes network connections through those proxies. It uses user-supplied proxy credentials and URLs but does not perform any data exfiltration, network anomalies, or malicious actions. The code appears to be standard implementation for proxy handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a proxy connection utility with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It correctly handles proxy URL parsing and socket connection wrapping. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leakage.",
