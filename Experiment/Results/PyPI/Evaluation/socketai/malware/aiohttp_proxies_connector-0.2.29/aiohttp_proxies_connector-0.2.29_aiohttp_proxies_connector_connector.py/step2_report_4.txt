  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Code review:** The code handles proxy URL construction, socket wrapping, and connection management in a standard way. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded credentials are present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling with no malicious intent.  \n- **Code review:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Proxy credentials are supplied externally, which is typical.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, standard proxy connector implementation with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Code review:** Uses user-supplied proxy URLs and credentials; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for proxy connection management, with no malicious indicators.  \n- **Code review:** No hardcoded secrets; external functions are used for socket creation and URL parsing, which are assumed safe unless proven otherwise.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are justified.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the reliance on external functions (`parse_proxy_url`, `create_socket_wrapper`) and notes some uncertainty.  \n- **Code review:** The external functions' security is unknown, which introduces some risk. However, within the provided code, no malicious patterns or secrets are evident.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are reasonable, given the external dependency uncertainty.  \n- **Verdict:** The cautious approach is appropriate; no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 across reports reflects a minor concern mainly due to external dependencies and user-supplied inputs, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 remains appropriate, considering external functions and user inputs.\n\n**Additional note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based solely on this code snippet, I would concur with the provided scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured proxy connection utility with no signs of malicious behavior. The only slight concern is the reliance on external functions (`parse_proxy_url`, `create_socket_wrapper`), which should be verified for security in a comprehensive review.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
