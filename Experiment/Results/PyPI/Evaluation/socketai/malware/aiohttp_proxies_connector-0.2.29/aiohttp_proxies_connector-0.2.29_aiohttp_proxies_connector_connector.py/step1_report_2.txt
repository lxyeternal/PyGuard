{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for handling proxy connections in an asynchronous HTTP client, including a custom resolver and proxy connector.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes such as proxy_type, host, port, username, password, and from function parameters like url, host, port, etc.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the use of proxy credentials, URL construction, and connection creation, which could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input data (proxy URL, parameters) flows into parse_proxy_url and class attributes, which are then used in URL formatting and socket creation for connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for setting up proxy connections; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Proxy credentials are passed externally, not hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom resolver and proxy connector for asynchronous HTTP requests. It handles proxy URL parsing, constructs proxy URLs dynamically, and wraps socket creation for proxy connections. The code appears clean, well-structured, and uses standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual logic is present. The use of user-provided proxy credentials and URLs is normal for proxy handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activities. All data flows are related to legitimate proxy connection setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical proxy connection setup and resolution, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It securely handles proxy credentials and URL construction. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are identified based on the provided code.",
