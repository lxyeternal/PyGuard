{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package module that manages SOCKS proxy connections, defining imports, error classes, helper functions, and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the module's own version variable (__version__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or external network operations are directly shown.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from source to sink within this code snippet; it primarily defines module exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward module setup with standard import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy connection handling and error management, and defines module-level variables and exports. No input handling, data processing, or network activity is present. The structure suggests this is part of a larger package. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or insecure code practices in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard module initialization file for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and benign.",
