{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components for a SOCKS proxy connection library, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and components from the same package directory: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or actions; no data is processed or transmitted within this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this code solely imports and exports components without executing or handling data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and assigns a version string. It then defines __all__ for public API exposure. No input handling, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure suggests standard package setup without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package module that organizes imports and exports for a SOCKS proxy library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
