  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export components related to a proxy connection library, including connectors, error classes, helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present; no data processing or output functions are shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code only imports and exports modules, with no logic or runtime behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes and functions from local modules, defines a version string, and specifies __all__ for exports. There is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. It appears to be a straightforward module interface or API setup without any suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining exports for a proxy connection library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
