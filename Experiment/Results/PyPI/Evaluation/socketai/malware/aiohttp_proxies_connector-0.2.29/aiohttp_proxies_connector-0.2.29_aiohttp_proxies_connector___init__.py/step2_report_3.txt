  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code snippet to determine if there are any security concerns, malware risks, or obfuscation issues.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The provided code is a typical Python package `__init__.py` or module setup file.\n   - It imports components from internal modules (`connector`, `errors`, `helpers`, `proto`) and defines `__version__` and `__all__`.\n   - There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code's purpose is to organize and expose the public API of a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute any code at runtime beyond imports and exports.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The imports are from local modules, which are assumed to be part of the same package, and no external or dynamic code loading is evident.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with clear import statements and API exposure.\n   - No obfuscated code, encrypted strings, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The structure is standard for a Python package's interface module.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0. The code is transparent and readable.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0. The code itself does not introduce security risks; it is a benign setup module.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns Based on Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is purely an interface layer, any security issues would likely originate from the underlying modules (`connector`, `errors`, etc.). However, those are not part of this snippet.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, with high confidence, and no anomalies.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- No further action is required based on this code snippet.\n\n**Note**: Always review the actual implementation of the imported modules for comprehensive security assurance.",
