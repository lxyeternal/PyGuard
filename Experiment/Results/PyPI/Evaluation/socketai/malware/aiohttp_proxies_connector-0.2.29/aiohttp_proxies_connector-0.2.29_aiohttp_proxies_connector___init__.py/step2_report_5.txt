  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports components from internal modules and exports them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module setup file for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling.\n- The confidence level across reports is high (mostly 1), and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. The reports consistently identify that this code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify that this is a simple module setup with no active logic or data flow.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — the code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or intent is observed.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Potential Risks and Assumptions\n\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module setup, importing and exporting components for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no logic, data processing, or network activity that could pose security concerns. The consistent reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of any malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
