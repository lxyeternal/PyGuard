{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API interface for a SOCKS proxy library, importing and exposing core components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export only",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static setup with imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export structure, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module initialization file, importing internal components and defining __version__ and __all__ for API exposure. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and structure indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, with high confidence. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
