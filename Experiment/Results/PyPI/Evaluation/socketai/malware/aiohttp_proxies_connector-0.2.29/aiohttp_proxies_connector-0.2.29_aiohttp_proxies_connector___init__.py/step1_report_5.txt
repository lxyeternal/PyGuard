  "purpose": "The code appears to define an interface and imports for a proxy connection library, including error handling, helpers, and protocol definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No input or data reading sources are present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or network interactions are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this snippet. It mainly involves module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are evident. The code is straightforward, defining module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements, version declaration, and export definitions. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network activity. It serves as a module initializer or interface, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It simply imports and exposes components of a proxy connection library.",
