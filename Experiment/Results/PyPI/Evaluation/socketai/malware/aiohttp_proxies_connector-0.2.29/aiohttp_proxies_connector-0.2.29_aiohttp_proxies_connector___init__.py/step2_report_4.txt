  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports and exports components related to a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical package `__init__.py` or module setup for exposing internal components.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** None of the reports detect any malicious behavior or code. The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and standard; obfuscation is not present.\n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No evidence suggests supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**  \nSince the code is purely an import/export setup with no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations, there's no reason to assign any higher scores. All evidence points to a clean, legitimate package component.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and non-malicious.\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**End of analysis.**",
