  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code in question is a set of import and export statements, defining a module interface for a SOCKS proxy library.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network communication, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- The code appears to be a typical package initialization or API exposure file.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports identify that the code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** Malware and security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis & Justifications:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code is purely import/export definitions with no executable or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No obfuscation is present.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**  \n   The risk score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities, given the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n\n5. **Any signs of supply chain attack?**  \n   No. The code is a standard module interface, not performing any operations that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The current scores are appropriate and reasonable given the code snippet's nature.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:**  \n  The code is benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n| Aspect               | Score / Justification                                               |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware             | **0** — No malicious activity or code present.                     |\n| Obfuscated          | **0** — Clear, straightforward import/export structure.             |\n| Risk                | **0** — No vulnerabilities or security risks detected.             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the actual runtime code, especially any dynamically loaded components or network interactions, to ensure security. But based on this static analysis, no issues are present.",
