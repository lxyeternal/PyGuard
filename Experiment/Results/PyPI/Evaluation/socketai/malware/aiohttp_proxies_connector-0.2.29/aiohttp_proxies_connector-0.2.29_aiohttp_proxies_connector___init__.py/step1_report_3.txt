{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define and export modules, classes, and functions related to SOCKS proxy connections, including error handling and connection setup helpers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and module metadata (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "Exports via __all__, potentially used by other code to instantiate proxies or handle errors",
  "flows": "Imports source modules -> uses imported components (ProxyConnector, error classes, helpers, proxy types) -> exports components for external use",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup that imports dependencies, defines module metadata, and exports symbols. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain logic that could be exploited. It appears to be part of a larger package for proxy management. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module definition with imports and exports related to SOCKS proxy handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
