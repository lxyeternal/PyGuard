  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports components from internal modules (`connector`, `errors`, `helpers`, `proto`), defines a version string, and sets `__all__` for public API exposure.\n- There is no data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to serve as an API or interface layer for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that there are no issues, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors. They are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard module setup. No errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk scores:**  \n  All reports assign 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  All are at 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since there is no executable logic, data handling, or network activity, the risk is minimal.\n- The only concern would be if this code were maliciously altered, but as-is, it’s benign.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about the code's behavior beyond what is visible.\n- No suspicious patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution, are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low but non-zero score to account for the potential of future malicious modifications, though currently no risk exists)  \n- **Justification:** The code is purely structural, with no execution or data flow, so the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThis code fragment is a standard, benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk due to being a library setup, but effectively no risk in its current form)\n\n**Final note:**  \nAny future modifications involving dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations would warrant re-evaluation.",
