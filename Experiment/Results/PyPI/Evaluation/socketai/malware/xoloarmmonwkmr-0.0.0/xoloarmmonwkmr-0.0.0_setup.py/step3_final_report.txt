{
  "purpose": "This setup script initializes a Python package with specified dependencies and metadata. It appears to be a standard package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and the package metadata such as name and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the script does not process external input or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'xoloarmmonwkmr' is obfuscated and suspicious; author information is missing, which is unusual but not malicious. No dynamic or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no code execution or data handling beyond static configuration. The suspicious package name and missing author info are noted red flags, but they do not indicate malicious activity within this script. Dependencies are common libraries, but their malicious potential depends on their actual content, not this configuration. The malware score is correctly zero; the obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to the package name; the security risk score remains low (~0.2) as no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with a suspicious package name that warrants caution. No malicious activity is present in this setup script. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature but acknowledging obfuscation concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
