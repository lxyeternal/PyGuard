  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'xoloarmmonwkmr'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no code executing untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The setup process loads package dependencies but does not process external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears nonsensical or obfuscated, which could be suspicious. Author details are omitted, which is unusual. No code obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The dependencies include common libraries, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The obscure package name and missing author info are unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script with an unusual package name and missing author info. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this code fragment.",
