  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their assessments with the code, and determine appropriate scores and justifications.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code explicitly collects Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, verifies their validity, retrieves extensive user info, and exfiltrates all data—including the cookie—to a hardcoded Discord webhook.\n- The primary purpose is clearly malicious: unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation is present.\n- The code does not perform destructive actions or system damage but is designed for stealthy credential theft and privacy invasion.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes cookie theft and data exfiltration.\n- **Sources:** Correct; multiple browsers, Roblox API.\n- **Sinks:** Correct; data sent to webhook.\n- **Flows:** Correct; from cookie extraction to data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; multiple cookie extraction attempts, no obfuscation, malicious intent clear.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; malicious cookie stealer, no obfuscation, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 1, SecurityRisk: 1, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate given the malicious intent and direct exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Similar; accurate.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; multiple cookie methods, hardcoded webhook, system commands (though unused here).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; clearly malicious, data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.5, SecurityRisk: 0.75, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.75.\n\n**Discussion:** The malware score of 0.5 seems somewhat low considering the clear malicious intent. The code performs data theft, exfiltration, and employs multiple cookie extraction methods, which is quite malicious.\n\n**Suggestion:** Increase malware score to 0.8, aligning with the high malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; malicious data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.8, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Note:** The malware score aligns well with the behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; cookie theft and exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.9, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Note:** The high malware score is justified due to the clear malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; malicious credential theft.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.9, SecurityRisk: 0.9, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** The core behavior is malicious data exfiltration, which is high severity. The scores range from 0.5 to 1.0, but considering the straightforward credential theft, I believe the malware score should be **around 0.9** for all reports, reflecting high malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; remains **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code exfiltrates sensitive data, including cookies and user info, and could facilitate account hijacking, the risk should be **above 0.5**. Given the severity, I suggest **0.9** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Increase the malware score for Report 2 from 0.5 to **0.9**.\n- Confirm that the risk scores are consistent; they are appropriately high.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Final Estimate:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 1.0     | 0            | 1.0    |\n| 2       | **0.9** | 0            | **0.9** |\n| 3       | 0.9     | 0            | 0.9    |\n| 4       | 0.9     | 0            | 0.9    |\n| 5       | 0.9     | 0            | 0.9    |\n\nThis reflects the high malicious intent, straightforward behavior, and significant privacy risk posed by the code.",
