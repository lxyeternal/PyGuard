{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox cookies from the user's browser, verify their validity, gather user information from Roblox, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies for domains 'roblox.com', 'firefox', 'chromium', 'edge', 'opera', 'chrome'; HTTP GET requests to external APIs for IP address and Roblox user info.",
  "sinks": "Sending gathered cookies and user info directly to a Discord webhook; executing system commands via os.system.",
  "flows": "Cookies extracted from browser -> Cookie validation -> User info fetched from Roblox API -> Data compiled -> Sent to Discord webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple try-except blocks for cookie extraction; presence of hardcoded webhook URL; execution of system commands (os.system) which are unused here but may be for malicious purposes; collecting and exfiltrating sensitive user data including cookies, IP address, Roblox account info, and headshot.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to collect Roblox cookies from various browsers, validate the cookie, and if valid, gather extensive personal and account data from Roblox APIs. The data, including the Roblox cookie, user ID, IP address, and account details, is then exfiltrated via a Discord webhook. The use of multiple try-except blocks indicates a focus on robustness in cookie collection. Hardcoded webhook URL suggests a malicious intent for data exfiltration. The code also includes functions for executing system commands, which could be used for further malicious actions. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior such as hidden backdoors, system damage, or unauthorized access beyond cookie theft and data exfiltration is explicitly evident, but the intent to harvest and send user data covertly is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox users, exfiltrating sensitive information to an attacker-controlled webhook. It does not contain advanced malware behaviors like damaging files or reverse shells but clearly aims at malicious data theft and privacy invasion. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and cookie harvesting from browsers indicates a high malicious intent.",
