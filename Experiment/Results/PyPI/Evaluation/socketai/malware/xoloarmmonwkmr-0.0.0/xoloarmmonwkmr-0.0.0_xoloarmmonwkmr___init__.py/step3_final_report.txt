{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, validates them, gathers user info, and exfiltrates all data—including cookies and user details—to a Discord webhook for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies from Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome; Roblox API endpoints; IP address request.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to the hardcoded Discord webhook with sensitive data; potential use of os.system (though unused here).",
  "flows": "Cookie collection from browsers -> validation via robloxpy -> user info retrieval -> data exfiltration via webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple browser cookie extraction methods; no obfuscation; direct exfiltration of sensitive data; hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, performing malicious data theft by harvesting Roblox cookies and user info from various browsers, validating the cookies, and sending all data to an external webhook. No obfuscation or destructive system actions are present. The code's intent is clearly malicious, designed for privacy invasion and potential account hijacking. The exfiltration method is direct and unencrypted, indicating malicious intent. The code operates silently without user consent, confirming its malicious nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a high-severity Roblox cookie stealer that exfiltrates sensitive user data to an external server. It is not obfuscated, performs straightforward malicious activities, and poses a significant security and privacy risk.",
