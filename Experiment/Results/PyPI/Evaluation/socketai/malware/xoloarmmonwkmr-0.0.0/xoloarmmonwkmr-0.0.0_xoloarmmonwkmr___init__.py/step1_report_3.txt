{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox account cookies and user information, then send this data to a Discord webhook for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Browser cookie stores for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Chromium-based browsers; user info API at roblox.com; IP address via api.ipify.org.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook POST request which transmits potentially sensitive information; the extracted Roblox cookie and user info are sent in plain text.",
  "flows": "Cookies retrieved from browser cookie stores (sources) are validated and used to fetch user info; then the cookie and info are sent to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script collects .ROBLOSECURITY cookies from multiple browsers, which is suspicious. It then immediately posts sensitive data to a webhook, indicating malicious intent. Hardcoded webhook URL and extensive cookie scraping suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox accounts. It retrieves cookies from various browsers, validates the cookie, and upon validation, gathers user info from Roblox's API, including user ID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, and profile links. All this data, along with the user's IP address and the stolen cookie, is then sent to a Discord webhook. The script does not contain any obfuscated code, but it uses several cookie extraction methods and directly posts sensitive data, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The primary purpose is unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, with no legitimate user benefit. The code does not contain any backdoors or malware that damage the system but performs malicious data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it is designed to harvest Roblox account cookies and user data from browsers without consent and exfiltrate this data to an external Discord webhook. Its purpose aligns with malicious activity like account hijacking and privacy invasion.",
