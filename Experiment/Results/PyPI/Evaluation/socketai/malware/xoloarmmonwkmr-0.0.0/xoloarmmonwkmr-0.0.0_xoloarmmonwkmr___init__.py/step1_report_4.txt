{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract Roblox cookies from the user's browser, validate them, gather user information, and send this data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Cookies stored in browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for the domain 'roblox.com'; IP address via external API; Roblox user info via requests with cookies.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected cookies and user info via POST request to a Discord webhook; printing data to console.",
  "flows": "Browser cookies -> cookieLogger function (collects cookies) -> validation via robloxpy.Utils.CheckCookie -> data collection from Roblox API -> webhook POST with sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL; extensive cookie collection attempts across multiple browsers; immediate termination if cookie invalid; no obfuscation or encoding; printing sensitive cookie data in logs.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to collect Roblox authentication cookies from various browsers, validate them, and then harvest user-specific information such as UserID, Robux balance, account age, and profile links. It then sends this sensitive data to an external Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user data without consent. The inclusion of hardcoded webhook URL and broad cookie extraction indicates malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malicious system commands are present beyond data exfiltration. The script's structure aims at stealthily capturing and transmitting private user data.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a cookie stealer targeting Roblox users, exfiltrating sensitive authentication cookies and user info to an external webhook. It demonstrates malicious intent with significant privacy violations. The code is straightforward, without obfuscation, but its purpose is harmful.",
