{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract Roblox account cookies from various browsers and send detailed user information, including cookies and IP address, to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser cookies (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) for roblox.com, HTTP request to ipify.org for IP address, and cookies from the browser for Roblox login verification.",
  "sinks": "The webhook POST request that transmits cookies, user info, and IP address to an external server; uses requests.post to send sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Browser cookie extraction -> cookie validation -> Roblox user info retrieval -> data compilation -> webhook POST with sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL; extraction of cookies from multiple browsers without user consent; immediate transmission of cookies and user info to external server; no user verification or opt-in; potential use of robloxpy for account verification; no obfuscation detected but code structure is straightforward and unencrypted.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by gathering cookies related to Roblox from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the cookie with robloxpy. If valid, it retrieves user info via Roblox API and additional data through robloxpy functions. It constructs a detailed message containing user account info, Roblox profile links, and the cookie itself. This information is then sent to an external Discord webhook URL, hardcoded into the script. The script operates stealthily, harvesting cookies and user data without user consent, and transmitting this data externally. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscation or encryption, indicating malicious intent focused on user data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a credential and information stealer targeting Roblox users. It exploits browser cookies to extract login tokens, verifies their validity, and then exfiltrates sensitive user data, including cookies, IP address, and account info, to an external server via webhook. Its behavior is malicious, designed for unauthorized access and privacy invasion.",
