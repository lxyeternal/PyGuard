{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox account cookies from various browsers and send detailed user information, including cookies, to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads cookies from browser storage (firefox, chromium, edge, opera, chrome) related to 'roblox.com' and makes HTTP requests to retrieve user info based on the extracted cookie.",
  "sinks": "The code sends the stolen cookie and user info to a remote Discord webhook via an HTTP POST request, exposing sensitive data externally.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from browser storage (sources) and then used in requests to Roblox's API and the external webhook (sink), transmitting user data outside the local environment.",
  "anomalies": "The code operates without user consent, specifically targeting Roblox cookies. It employs multiple browser cookie extraction methods, indicating an attempt to maximize data theft. The use of an external webhook and the straightforward collection and exfiltration of cookies suggest malicious intent. No obfuscation is present, but the purpose is clearly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing necessary modules, including those for browser cookie access and HTTP requests. It defines a function to gather cookies associated with 'roblox.com' from various browsers, focusing on extracting the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, which is used for Roblox authentication. It then verifies the cookie's validity by checking with Roblox's API. If invalid, it notifies via webhook and exits. If valid, it fetches user info, such as UserID, username, Robux balance, and other profile details, and exfiltrates this data to a specified Discord webhook, including the cookie in the payload. The code is intentionally designed to silently gather sensitive account data and transmit it externally, indicating malicious intent. There is no indication of obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious; it functions as a Roblox account cookie stealer, collecting cookies from various browsers and sending detailed user info to an external webhook without user consent. The purpose is clearly malicious data exfiltration.",
