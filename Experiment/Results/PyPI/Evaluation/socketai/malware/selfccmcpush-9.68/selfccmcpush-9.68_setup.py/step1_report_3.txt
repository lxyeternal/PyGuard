{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'selfccmcpush' with the 'modlib' package, including metadata and classifiers. It also attempts to execute some potentially malicious code if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to check for the existence of 'tahg'. It also imports subprocess and os modules, and potentially executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded script, which could be used to run malicious code or establish a backdoor. The code also accesses environment and filesystem, which could leak information or execute further malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, executes PowerShell command (potential malicious payload). Also proceeds with setup process if no exception occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the encoded PowerShell command run in a subprocess, especially without clear purpose or documentation. The command is hidden with 'Hidden' window style and encoded, which is suspicious. The setup code itself is normal but includes this hidden payload execution. The except blocks suppress errors silently, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and performs a directory existence check. If 'tahg' does not exist, it attempts to run a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious payloads. The setup process appears normal, providing package metadata and dependencies. The use of silent exception handling prevents detection of errors, which could mask malicious activity. Overall, the code contains suspicious activity associated with executing obfuscated commands without explanation, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical setup task but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered if a specific directory is missing. This behavior is suspicious and likely malicious, potentially used to execute malicious code or establish backdoor access during package installation. The overall security risk is high due to this hidden payload execution.",
