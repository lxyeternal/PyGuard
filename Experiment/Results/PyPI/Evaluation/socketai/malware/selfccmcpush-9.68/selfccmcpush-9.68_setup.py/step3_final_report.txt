{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious or sabotage behavior in the package setup code, specifically the execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "Conditional check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing a Base64-encoded PowerShell command; package metadata setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the subprocess with obfuscated code; external URL connection within the PowerShell command.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, runs encoded PowerShell command -> potentially downloads or executes malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags; execution conditioned on filesystem state; broad try-except blocks hiding errors; suspicious URL embedded in comments and likely in payload.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen if 'tahg' does not exist, with the command URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' indicating malicious intent. The command is encoded, run silently, and connected to a suspicious domain, suggesting malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. The setup() call appears legitimate but is wrapped in broad exception handling that suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The obfuscation, external URL, and stealthy execution are classic indicators of supply chain attack vectors. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.85-1) are justified given the evidence. The overall assessment indicates high malicious potential, warranting package flagging and further payload analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, potentially malicious code designed to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands silently, connecting to a suspicious external domain. The high scores across reports are justified, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent and significant security risk.",
