      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The use of encoding, silent execution, and suspicious URL strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup process appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious activity. The behavior warrants high security concern and further investigation."
