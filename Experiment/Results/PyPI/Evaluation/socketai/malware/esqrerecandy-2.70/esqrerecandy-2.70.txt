      "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command triggered conditionally, which aligns with common malware tactics such as remote code execution or backdoor setup. The high obfuscation, external URL, and silent error handling support a high suspicion of malicious intent. Scores of approximately 0.85 for malware, 0.9 for obfuscation, and 0.9 for security risk are appropriate. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm payload specifics, but the current evidence warrants treating this package as highly suspicious."
