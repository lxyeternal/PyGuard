      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation, silent error handling, and execution context are red flags. Scores in most reports are appropriate; however, report 5 underestimates the risk. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be scrutinized or avoided until further analysis of the encoded command confirms its nature."
