{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package with some obfuscated code that performs a runtime check for Windows OS and then executes a decryption of embedded data, potentially leading to code execution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), and executing decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypts data -> executes decrypted code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated description and long, meaningless strings in variables; use of exec() on decrypted data; inclusion of decryption keys within the code; code structure is intentionally obscure; unusual setup of long description and author details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, if the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code with exec(). The decryption process indicates potential malicious intent, as it dynamically runs code during package installation, which is unusual and risky. The obfuscation, embedded encrypted payload, and use of exec() suggest attempts to hide malicious behavior or backdoor access. The overall structure and the obfuscated strings are suspicious, pointing towards malicious or at least highly insecure code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated logic that decrypts and executes code during package installation, which is a common pattern for malicious backdoors or malicious behavior. The presence of hardcoded encryption keys and use of exec() significantly increase the risk. This code exhibits high malicious potential and should be considered unsafe for use.",
