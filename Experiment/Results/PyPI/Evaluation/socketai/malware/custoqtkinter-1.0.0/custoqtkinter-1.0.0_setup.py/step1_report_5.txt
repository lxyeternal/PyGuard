  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'custoqtkinter' with custom install behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements, setup() function arguments, and embedded code within the run() method.",
  "sinks": "exec() call with decrypted content, import of 'requests' and 'fernet' inside the run() method.",
  "flows": "During installation, if on Windows, requests and Fernet are imported, then a decrypted string is executed via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted data suggests dynamic code execution which is unusual and suspicious in a setup script. Decrypts and executes code during install. Hardcoded encrypted string and decryption key. No visible malicious code, but this pattern is suspicious and often used for malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package setup parameters and a custom install command. The custom run() method checks if the OS is Windows; if so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the result via exec(), which could potentially run malicious code. The use of dynamic execution in a setup script is highly unusual and potentially dangerous, indicating a high risk of malicious intent. The rest of the code appears standard for Python package setup, with no other suspicious patterns. The encrypted payload and runtime code execution are significant red flags.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing potentially harmful code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior indicates a high risk of malware delivery within the package. The setup script's pattern of dynamic code execution is suspicious and should be treated with caution.",
