{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'custoqtkinter' with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes code on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies ('fernet', 'requests'), environment variables ('os.name'), and imports modules during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes decrypted code via exec() with Fernet-decrypted payload on Windows systems, which can be malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, os.name check triggers import of 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed dynamically during installation is suspicious. The payload could contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom install class. In the run() method, it checks if the OS is Windows (nt). If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key, executing the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior is unusual and potentially malicious, as it dynamically executes code that is encrypted within the setup script. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent or supply chain attack. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate with no other suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior pattern: decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, which is a common tactic for malicious packages. The encrypted payload and hardcoded key suggest an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Overall, the package exhibits high malicious intent with a security risk score close to 1.",
