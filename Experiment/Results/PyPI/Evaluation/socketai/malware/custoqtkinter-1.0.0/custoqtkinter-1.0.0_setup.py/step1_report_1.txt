{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'custoqtkinter' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, imports modules, and during installation, conditionally executes code if on Windows.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function decrypts and executes code that is potentially malicious, especially since it decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a large, seemingly random long description; encrypted code execution during installation; no clear reason for decrypting and executing code; presence of cryptographic operations in setup script; execution of code from decrypted data which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a class that overrides the run() method, which, on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet token to obtain code and executes it with exec(). This is highly suspicious because executing decrypted code during package installation indicates potential malicious behavior or backdoor. The long description appears obfuscated or random, adding to suspicion. No legitimate reason for such code is apparent in typical setup scripts, and the use of encrypted payloads to execute arbitrary code is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: during installation on Windows, it decrypts and executes code from an embedded encrypted payload, indicating a backdoor or malicious component. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a serious security concern. The package should be considered dangerous, and its use is strongly discouraged.",
