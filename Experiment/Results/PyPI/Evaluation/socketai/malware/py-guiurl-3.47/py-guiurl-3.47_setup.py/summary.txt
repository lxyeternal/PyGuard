  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, silent PowerShell code triggered conditionally, with suspicious references, indicating likely malicious intent. The high obfuscation and covert execution justify high malware and security risk scores. The package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further decoding of the payload."
