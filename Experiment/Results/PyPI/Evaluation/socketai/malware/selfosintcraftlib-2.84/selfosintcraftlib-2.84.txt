      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, with obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a high security threat. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores to 0.8-0.85 would better reflect the severity, but current scores are reasonable."
