  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to perform some computational or data processing task, but without specific context, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input functions, environment variables, file reads, or network requests; however, the provided code does not explicitly show data inputs or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, file writes, or data outputs; the code does not explicitly perform such actions, and no dangerous functions are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to the lack of visible input or output operations; the code mainly contains definitions and possibly safe computational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. The code does not include obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution. No anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "A review of the code indicates standard Python structures with no signs of malicious intent. There are no external data sources, unsafe data handling, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a benign, standard Python script. Due to the absence of input/output operations, environment variable usage, or network calls, the risk of malicious behavior is low. There are no anomalies or obfuscation signs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It likely serves a legitimate purpose, but without additional context, a definitive purpose cannot be confirmed. Overall, the risk level is very low.",
