{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'send' with an immediate print statement at class scope.",
  "sources": "The print statement executes during class definition, which is at import time.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Class definition triggers print, but no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual placement of a print statement at class scope, which executes immediately upon class load.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a class 'send' and executes a print statement at class scope. There are no data inputs, external data, or malicious code. The print statement's placement is unconventional but benign. No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and no security vulnerabilities are present. The immediate execution during class definition is atypical but not harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The unconventional print placement does not pose a threat but is noteworthy as poor style or placeholder code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.05) is appropriate to reflect the unusual pattern without implying danger.",
