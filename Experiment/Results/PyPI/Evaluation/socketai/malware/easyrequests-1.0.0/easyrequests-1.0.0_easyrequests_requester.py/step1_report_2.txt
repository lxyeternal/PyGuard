{
  "purpose": "Defines a class named 'send' and prints 'Hi' during class definition.",
  "sources": "The print statement executed at the class level during class definition.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to stdout; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of print statement directly inside class definition without methods or attributes; no obvious malicious intent, but unconventional structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'send' and immediately executes a print statement upon class loading. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no data flows from untrusted sources to any sinks. The print statement is static and does not involve user input or external data. The code lacks any behavior that could be considered malicious or suspicious, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal and benign code snippet that defines a class and prints a message during class definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
