  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The unconventional print placement does not pose a threat but is noteworthy as poor style or placeholder code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.05) is appropriate to reflect the unusual pattern without implying danger."
