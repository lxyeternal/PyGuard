      "conclusion": "The package contains heavily obfuscated, runtime-decoded code that, when executed, exhibits malicious behavior such as network requests and system commands. The embedded payloads pose a high security risk, and the high malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The core setup code is benign, but the embedded payloads should be thoroughly analyzed or removed to prevent security breaches."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no current malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The potential for misuse exists if the 'send' function is invoked maliciously later, but based solely on this import statement, the code is safe."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.05) is appropriate to reflect the unusual pattern without implying danger."
