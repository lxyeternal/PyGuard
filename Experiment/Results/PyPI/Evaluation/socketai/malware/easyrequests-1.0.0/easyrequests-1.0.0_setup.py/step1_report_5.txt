{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'easyrequests', including metadata and dependencies, and decodes and executes a base64-encoded string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; the embedded base64-encoded string which is decoded and executed.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded base64 content, which may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded and immediately executed via exec(), potentially running malicious code. The rest of the script handles package setup, which is benign.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded base64 content is unusual and risky, indicating possible malicious intent. The base64 string decodes to code that performs network operations and runs shell commands, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for setup and package metadata. The critical concern is the base64-encoded string, which upon decoding, runs additional code that appears to perform network requests, run shell commands, and potentially access system information. The presence of exec() on decoded code is a major red flag for malicious activity. The rest of the script handles standard package setup and appears legitimate, but the exec() invocation indicates that the primary concern is the decoded payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior embedded in the base64 string, which is decoded and executed at runtime. This code could perform unauthorized network operations, run shell commands, or exfiltrate data. The rest of the code appears normal, but the use of exec() on obfuscated code is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
