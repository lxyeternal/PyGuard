{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'easyrequests' with minimal dependencies. However, it contains embedded obfuscated payloads decoded at runtime, which execute potentially malicious code.",
  "sources": "The large base64-encoded string decoded via base64.b64decode(), which contains code that imports modules like os, subprocess, and executes system commands or network requests.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function applied to the decoded base64 payload, leading to execution of dynamically decoded code that may perform system commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded at runtime, then passed directly to exec(), executing the embedded code. This code may perform network requests, run shell commands, or import system modules.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large, obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded at runtime, then executed via exec(). The code within the payload is heavily encoded, making static analysis difficult. The payload's content, involving system or network operations, is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup code appears benign and typical for a Python package. The critical concern is the embedded base64 payload, which, once decoded, imports system modules and executes code dynamically. The obfuscation level is high, with base64 encoding and runtime execution, which are common in malicious scripts to hide behavior. The decoded code's actions—such as making network requests to suspicious domains or executing system commands—indicate malicious intent. The high scores for malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified given the evidence. The use of exec() on obfuscated payloads is a red flag for malicious activity, and the payload's behavior suggests potential data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains heavily obfuscated, runtime-decoded code that, when executed, exhibits malicious behavior such as network requests and system commands. The embedded payloads pose a high security risk, and the high malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The core setup code is benign, but the embedded payloads should be thoroughly analyzed or removed to prevent security breaches.",
