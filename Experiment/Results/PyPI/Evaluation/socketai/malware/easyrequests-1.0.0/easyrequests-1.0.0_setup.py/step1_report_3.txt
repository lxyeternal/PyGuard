{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script for 'easyrequests' and includes obfuscated code that appears to be executing embedded base64-decoded scripts, potentially malicious or obfuscated.",
  "sources": "The code reads a README.md file for the long description; the embedded base64 string is a source of potentially malicious code; no other explicit input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 code executes with exec(), which could be a sink allowing malicious code to run. It also uses import statements that could be misused if the embedded code is malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and executed immediately via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow where embedded code is run, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large, complex base64-encoded string decoded and executed at runtime, which is suspicious. The code within the base64 string, once decoded, appears to contain network requests, possibly malicious, including calls to suspicious domains and potentially dangerous imports. The code's purpose is obscured, and its execution is hidden behind the exec() call.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a simple import and type check, then proceeds to decode and execute an obfuscated base64 string. The base64 content, once decoded, contains code that performs network requests to external domains, possibly exfiltrating data or performing malicious actions. The setup script for the package itself appears normal, but the embedded code is suspicious and likely malicious. The use of exec() on decoded data is a common indicator of obfuscated or malicious code injection. The purpose of the embedded code seems to be to run malicious network operations or payloads stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious payload embedded within a base64 string that is executed at runtime via exec(). This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests malicious intent, potentially leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, or other malicious actions. The setup portion appears legitimate, but the embedded code warrants immediate review and removal.",
