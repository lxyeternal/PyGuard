  "conclusion": "The package contains heavily obfuscated, runtime-decoded code that, when executed, exhibits malicious behavior such as network requests and system commands. The embedded payloads pose a high security risk, and the high malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The core setup code is benign, but the embedded payloads should be thoroughly analyzed or removed to prevent security breaches."
