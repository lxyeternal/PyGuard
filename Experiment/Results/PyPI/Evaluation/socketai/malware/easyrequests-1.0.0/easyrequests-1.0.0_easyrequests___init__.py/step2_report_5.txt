  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only imports 'send' from 'pyrequester.requester' with no further actions.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — minimal, given no actual operation occurs.\n- Confidence: 0.8 — reasonable, based on the minimal code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the import alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.6) due to the potential of 'send' being used maliciously later.\n- Malware score: 0 — justified.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given the potential but unconfirmed risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also only an import statement, with no suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 1 — perhaps slightly high, but consistent with the minimal code.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning; import only.\n- Confidence: 0.8 — consistent.\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same minimal import, no immediate malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.5 — reasonable, as the potential exists but no evidence.\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only an import statement with no immediate malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code snippet.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk based on the provided code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- Since the code only imports a function and does not perform any network activity or contain obfuscation, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are appropriate given the context; even if the 'send' function could be used maliciously later, the import alone does not warrant a high risk score.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, based on potential misuse if the 'send' function is invoked maliciously later.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
