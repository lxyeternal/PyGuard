  "purpose": "Prints a message indicating custom script execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "The script reads from standard input/output via print(), and checks if __name__ == \"__main__\".",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Script execution flow is straightforward: if run as main, execute setup() which prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple print statement, no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It defines a setup function that prints a message when the script runs directly. There are no external data inputs, no environment variable usage, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The purpose appears to be to provide a console message during installation, possibly as a custom installation step or notification.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving a simple informational purpose during package installation. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
