  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple script that prints a message during package installation.\n- The code imports `sys` but does not utilize it beyond import.\n- There are no external data inputs, network operations, or data leaks.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose appears to be informational or for logging during installation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is benign; it performs a straightforward print operation.\n- No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- The reports' conclusions align with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 or 0.1 (minor, possibly due to import of sys)\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all scores are 0 or very close to 0, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n- The code is clearly benign.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious activity is present.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis.\n- No false positives or unwarranted suspicion.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the above, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**However,** considering the minimal import of `sys` and the fact that the script runs during installation, a very slight security concern could be noted if the script were modified in the future. But as it stands, it's benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\nThis script is a simple, benign message print during installation with no security concerns.",
