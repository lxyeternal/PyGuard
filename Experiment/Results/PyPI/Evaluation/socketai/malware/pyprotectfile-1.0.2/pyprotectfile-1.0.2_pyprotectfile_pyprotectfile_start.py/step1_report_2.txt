{
  "purpose": "This script appears to execute a simple setup routine during the installation of a package, likely intended for logging or setup confirmation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system input via the sys module (import sys), but only uses it for import purposes; no external input is actively read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The only action is printing a message to standard output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present. The code only executes a print statement when run directly.",
  "anomalies": "The script runs a print statement during installation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module but does not utilize it beyond import, indicating minimal functionality. The script runs a simple print statement within the main guard, likely for logging or confirmation during installation. There are no suspicious data flows, no external data collection, no network activity, and no malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose seems benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign print operation during installation, likely for logging or informational purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a normal setup script.",
