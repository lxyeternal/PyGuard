  "purpose": "Prints a message during package installation to indicate custom setup execution.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input; it imports 'sys' but does not utilize it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'sys' is unnecessary but harmless; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that defines a setup() function printing a message, invoked when run as main. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The import of 'sys' is redundant but not malicious. The script's purpose appears to be informational during installation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 or 0.1. Given the simplicity and lack of malicious activity, the scores are appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving a simple informational purpose during installation. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the lack of malicious intent or security risks.",
