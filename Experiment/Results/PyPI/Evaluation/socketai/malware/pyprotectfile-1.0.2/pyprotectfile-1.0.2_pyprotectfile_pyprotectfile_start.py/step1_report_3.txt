  "purpose": "Prints a message during the installation of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys but does not use it. It defines a setup() function that prints a message indicating execution during package installation. The main block calls setup(), which simply outputs a message. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to output a message during installation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
