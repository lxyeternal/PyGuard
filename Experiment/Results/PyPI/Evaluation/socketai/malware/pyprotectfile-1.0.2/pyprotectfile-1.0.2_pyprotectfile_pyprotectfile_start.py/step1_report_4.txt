{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform a simple setup or initialization task during package installation, specifically printing a message indicating custom execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own execution context and the standard input via the sys module, but primarily just prints a message.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves executing the setup() function when the script runs directly, which only prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The script is straightforward and performs a benign action.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys but does not use it beyond the import. It defines a setup() function that prints a message indicating a custom script during installation. When run as the main module, it executes setup(), resulting in the message being printed. There are no inputs, external data processing, or suspicious operations involved.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple script intended to display a message during installation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
