  "purpose": "Obfuscated malicious script designed to execute hidden code and potentially compromise the system.",
  "sources": "Reading base64-encoded strings, zlib decompression, base64 decoding, and dynamic code execution via eval.",
  "sinks": "eval function executing dynamically decoded and decompressed code, which may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Source of base64 and compressed data → decoding/decompression → conversion to string → eval to execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, multiple layers of encoding and compression, use of dynamic evaluation, undefined lambda functions, and obscure variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with several import statements, including random, base64, codecs, and zlib. It then sets up obfuscation dictionaries and functions with complex, obscure lambda functions that generate code at runtime. The key part involves base64-encoded data 'b' which, when decoded, is decompressed via zlib, decoded again, and then processed with further transformations to produce executable code. The use of eval with dynamically reconstructed code suggests an intent to hide malicious payloads. The code also includes base64 strings and decompression routines that are typical in malware obfuscation to mask malicious activities. The code's structure and multiple encoding layers strongly indicate malicious intent, aimed at executing concealed code without detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated, uses multiple decoding layers, and ultimately executes dynamically reconstructed code via eval. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide harmful payloads and perform unauthorized system actions. The structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, and the code should be considered dangerous.",
