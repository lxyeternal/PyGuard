{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyprotectfile' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data files.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools functions, defines setup parameters, specifies dependencies in install_requires, and includes a data file 'start.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; dependencies are standard, and no code execution or data handling occurs within this script.",
  "flows": "The setup script orchestrates package installation parameters; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The listed dependencies include some suspicious or potentially problematic packages such as 'sockets' (likely a typo for 'socket' or a non-standard package), 'robloxpy', and 'browser_cookie3' which could be used for cookie theft. The presence of 'browser_cookie3' and 'robloxpy' in an obfuscation tool context might indicate potential misuse for credential or session theft, though not inherently malicious in this setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration with standard fields and dependencies. However, some dependencies ('sockets', 'robloxpy', 'browser_cookie3') could be leveraged for malicious purposes such as credential harvesting or session hijacking if misused in the actual package code. The script itself does not perform any malicious actions. The inclusion of a data file 'start.py' suggests additional code that may be executed elsewhere, but is not present here for analysis. The presence of dependencies with potential privacy or security implications warrants caution, especially if the package is used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with some dependencies that could be misused for malicious purposes if the package's functional code uses them for nefarious activities. No malicious code or obfuscation is evident in this configuration. Caution should be exercised when installing or using this package due to the nature of some dependencies.",
