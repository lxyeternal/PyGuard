{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration defining metadata, dependencies, and data files for the 'pyprotectfile' package.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the 'data_files' entry for 'start.py'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution or use of 'start.py' post-installation; dependencies like 'browser_cookie3', 'robloxpy', 'discord_webhook' could be misused if exploited.",
  "flows": "Installation process loads dependencies; 'start.py' may be executed or utilized after installation, potentially leading to malicious activity if malicious code exists within.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'sockets' as a dependency (a standard library module) suggests possible typo or obfuscation; 'start.py' inclusion without content review raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a typical configuration with no embedded executable code, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The dependencies, while potentially misused, do not constitute malicious activity by themselves. The presence of 'start.py' warrants further review, as it could contain malicious code. The mention of 'sockets' as a dependency is suspicious, likely a typo or an attempt at obfuscation. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.4) due to dependencies that could be exploited if 'start.py' or runtime code is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign and standard. The primary security concern lies in the content of 'start.py' and the potential misuse of listed dependencies. No malicious code or obfuscation is evident from this configuration alone. Scores are assigned accordingly, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and a moderate risk score reflecting dependency-related concerns.",
