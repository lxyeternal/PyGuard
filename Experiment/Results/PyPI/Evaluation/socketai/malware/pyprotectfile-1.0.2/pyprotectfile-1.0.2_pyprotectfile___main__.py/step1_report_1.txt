  "purpose": "Obfuscated script potentially executing dynamic code, likely for malicious intent or concealment.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded strings, zlib compressed data, random number generation, environment variables, string manipulations, eval and exec calls.",
  "sinks": "eval, exec, decode, decompress, base64 decoding, dynamic string construction, lambda functions executing code.",
  "flows": "Data is fetched from encoded strings and compressed payloads, decoded and decompressed, then executed via eval and exec with dynamically constructed code.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using multiple layers of encoding and compression, dynamic execution with eval and exec, use of lambda functions for obfuscation, hardcoded encoded payloads, references to suspicious URLs, and arbitrary string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing modules and setting up obfuscation dictionaries. It defines complex lambda functions and string manipulations designed to generate code dynamically. The code contains a base64-encoded, zlib compressed payload which, after decoding and decompressing, is executed via eval/exec. There are multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation, making static analysis difficult. The presence of 'eval', 'exec', base64, and compressed data strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to execute hidden payloads or backdoors. Additionally, the code references URLs and strings associated with obfuscation and possibly command-and-control servers. The overall structure aims to conceal malicious actions, typical of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with multiple layers of encoding, compressed payloads, and dynamic execution functions. It is designed to conceal malicious code execution, likely executing arbitrary payloads fetched from encoded data. The presence of eval, exec, and multiple encoding layers suggests a high probability of malicious intent, possibly as part of an infection or backdoor. It should be considered dangerous and should not be executed in a trusted environment.",
