  "anomalies": [
    "Heavy obfuscation including base64, zlib decompression, character code manipulations",

    "String manipulations designed to hide true behavior"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing standard modules. It defines obfuscate strings and complex lambda functions that generate code from random values, which are then executed via eval(). The embedded base64-encoded string is decoded and decompressed, then further processed with character code transformations before being executed. This layered decoding and obfuscation strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads. The code's structure and heavy obfuscation point to malicious intent, likely to run hidden code that could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or remote control. The code is designed to evade detection through multiple layers of encoding and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is highly obfuscated with multiple decoding layers and dynamic code execution. It appears to be designed for malicious purposes, executing a payload concealed within base64-encoded, compressed, and character-encoded data. The use of eval() on dynamically generated code and embedded encrypted payload indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
