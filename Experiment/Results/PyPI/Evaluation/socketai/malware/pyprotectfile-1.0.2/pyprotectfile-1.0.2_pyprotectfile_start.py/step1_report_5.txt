  "purpose": "This script prints a message during the installation of the package, likely for logging or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The script reads from the standard input implicitly via the 'sys' module import, but does not actively read any data.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the main block executing the setup() function, which only prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "The 'sys' module is imported but not used; this is unnecessary but not malicious. The print statement is benign and does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The script's sole function is to execute a print statement during installation, indicating an informational message. The import of 'sys' is unused, which could be a minor anomaly, but it does not impact security. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears harmless, serving only to display a message during installation. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
