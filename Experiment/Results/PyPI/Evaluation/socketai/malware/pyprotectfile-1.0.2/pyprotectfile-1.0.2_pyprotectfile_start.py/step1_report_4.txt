{
  "purpose": "This script executes a setup function during the installation process of the package, likely for custom setup tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'sys' module, which is imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks such as network communication, file modification, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The setup() function is called when the script is run as the main module, which results in printing a message; there are no data flows that lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The script's sole purpose appears to be printing a message during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module but does not use it beyond the import statement. The setup() function is a simple print statement intended to execute during installation. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no potential data exfiltration or malicious actions. The code is straightforward and seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal setup script that only prints a message during installation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of sys import is unnecessary but harmless. Overall, it appears to be benign with no security concerns.",
