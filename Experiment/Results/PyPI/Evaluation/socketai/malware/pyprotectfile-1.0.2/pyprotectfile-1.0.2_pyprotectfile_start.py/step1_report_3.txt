  "purpose": "The script is designed to execute a setup function that prints a message during the installation of a package.",
  "sources": "The script reads the standard input/output when executed, specifically the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console; no untrusted data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The script executes setup() upon running as main, which results in a console message. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The script performs a simple print operation with no dynamic input or external data processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys but does not use it, indicating minimal functionality. The setup() function only prints a static message during installation, which is typical for custom install scripts. No malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign setup hook that outputs a message during installation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
