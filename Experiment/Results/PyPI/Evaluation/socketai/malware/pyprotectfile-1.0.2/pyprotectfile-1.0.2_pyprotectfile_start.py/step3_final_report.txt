  "purpose": "Prints a message during package installation for informational purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input; the code imports 'sys' but does not use it.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'sys', which is harmless but unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, defining a setup() function that prints a message, and calling it if run as main. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The import of 'sys' is redundant but not security-relevant. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score should be zero or very close to zero, with the minor unused import not constituting a real threat.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup message with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its behavior. The only minor note is the unused 'sys' import, which does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no threat.",
