  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code imports `sys` but does not use it.\n- Defines a `setup()` function that prints a static message.\n- Calls `setup()` when run as `__main__`.\n- No external input, no data flow, no network, no file operations.\n- No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, no backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Print a message during installation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies benign intent; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion; benign script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the script is simple and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same, for custom setup.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly more cautious, notes the import of `sys` is unnecessary but harmless.\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification for scores:** The script is very simple, no malicious activity. The unnecessary import is a minor anomaly, justifying a small securityRisk score (0.1). Confidence is high but not perfect, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same, for informational message.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the script as harmless; the import of `sys` is unnecessary but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly due to the unnecessary import, which is minor.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and typical for setup scripts.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minor due to unnecessary import, but not impactful)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign setup message with no security concerns.",
