  "purpose": "Print a message indicating a custom script execution during package installation",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data; it only executes a print statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The script executes a print statement upon running, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys but does not utilize it, indicating no complex operations. It defines a setup function that prints a message indicating a custom installation step. The script executes setup() when run as __main__, which only outputs a message and does not perform any malicious activity or data exfiltration. There are no suspicious behaviors, no external network calls, no handling of sensitive data, and no obfuscated code. The script appears to be a benign setup message commonly used for informational purposes during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to print an informational message during installation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
