{
  "purpose": "The script prints a message indicating it runs during the installation process of a package named 'mi_paquete'.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing external; it only uses the sys module (import sys).",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a print statement within a function called during script execution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is simple, containing only a print statement within a setup() function. It is invoked when the script is run as the main module. The sys module is imported but not used, which is harmless. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a benign setup or informational script typically used during package installation or setup processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard setup message during package installation. No malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors detected.",
