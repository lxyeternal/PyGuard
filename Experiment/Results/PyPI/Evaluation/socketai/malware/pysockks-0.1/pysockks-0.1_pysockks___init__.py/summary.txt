  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior; the scores are appropriate and consistent with the reports. The primary concern is obfuscation and dynamic code features in Report 5, which should be monitored but do not currently indicate malware. Overall, supply chain risk remains low."
