  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility involving Python's standard library functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or data files (if any are included, though none are explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data output functions if present, but none are explicitly evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like environment variables or parameters through functions or processing steps to output or other functions, but specific flows cannot be precisely identified without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The analysis indicates that the code is either incomplete or minimal, consisting mainly of standard Python constructs without complex or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The absence of unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code seems benign and straightforward.",
