All indicators point to high malicious potential, and the high scores across reports are appropriate. It should be flagged as malicious and handled accordingly."

The primary concern is obfuscation and dynamic code features in Report 5, which should be monitored but do not currently indicate malware. Overall, supply chain risk remains low."
