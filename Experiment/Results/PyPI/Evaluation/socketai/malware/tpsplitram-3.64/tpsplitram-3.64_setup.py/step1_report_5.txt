{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'tpsplitram' with a dependency on 'modlib' and includes obfuscated code intended for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes a subprocess with obfuscated PowerShell command, and loads package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess potentially executes hidden commands that could be malicious, and the setup defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The script checks for the existence of a directory, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command if not found, and proceeds to package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated PowerShell command that appears to download or execute external code, presence of hardcoded URL 'esquelesquad.rip', and no visible legitimate reason for this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'setup' from 'distutils.core', then attempts to run a subprocess with a base64-encoded PowerShell command. This command is likely obfuscated to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing external code. The check for the directory 'tahg' and subsequent command execution suggest an attempt to run hidden or malicious scripts during installation. The setup function defines package metadata but is wrapped in a try-except block, which suppresses errors. The presence of obfuscated code and external URL indicates malicious intent or sabotage, potentially for remote code execution or data exfiltration. The code contains no legitimate reason to execute such commands in a standard package setup, raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious obfuscated PowerShell code designed to run silently during installation, likely to download or execute external malicious payloads. The code exhibits signs of sabotage and should not be trusted or installed.",
