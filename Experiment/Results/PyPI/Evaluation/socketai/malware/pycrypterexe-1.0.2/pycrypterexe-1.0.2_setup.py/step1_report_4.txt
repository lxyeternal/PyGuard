{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'pycrypterexe', with a custom install command that downloads and executes an external Python script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description. The custom InstallCommand downloads a script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py'. The 'requests.get' call retrieves external content. The subprocess executes the downloaded script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via 'subprocess.check_call'. Potential execution of malicious code contained in the remote script.",
  "flows": "The 'requests.get' retrieves remote code -> saved as 'WindowsUpdate.py' -> executed by subprocess -> potentially malicious code runs on the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes a remote script during installation without verification or validation, which is highly suspicious. Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess is potentially unsafe. The URL appears suspicious and non-standard. No checksums or signatures are used to verify the integrity or authenticity of the remote script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local file for package description, then defines a custom install command that downloads a script from a remote URL during package installation. It executes this remote script without validation, creating a significant security risk. The remote script's content and behavior are unknown, and executing code from untrusted sources during setup is malicious practice. The use of 'shell=True' in subprocess further amplifies risk, as it can lead to command injection. After execution, the script deletes the downloaded file. The overall behavior suggests an intent to run external code during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation without any validation. This could be used to run arbitrary malicious code on systems where the package is installed. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered dangerous to install or distribute.",
