  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external Python script during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py' from which the script is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.check_call('python WindowsUpdate.py', shell=True).",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save as WindowsUpdate.py -> Execute the script -> Remove the script after execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code fetches and executes a remote script during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. Use of shell=True in subprocess can be unsafe.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download a Python script from a specified URL during package installation. It then executes this script immediately, with error handling that removes the script if execution fails. The script is then deleted post-execution. This pattern is suspicious because it introduces a remote code execution step that could be malicious, especially since the URL is hardcoded and not validated. The code's intent appears to be to run arbitrary code from an external source at install time, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks or malware delivery.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation, which poses a significant security risk. This practice is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or at least highly unsafe.",
