  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation without validation, representing a high security threat. The pattern suggests supply chain attack potential or malware distribution. The high malware score (1), high security risk (1), and unobfuscated nature (0) are justified based on this behavior."
