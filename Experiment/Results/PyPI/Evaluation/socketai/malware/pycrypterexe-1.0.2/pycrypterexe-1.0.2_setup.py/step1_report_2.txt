{
  "purpose": "To define a setup script that customizes the installation process to download and execute an external script from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py' is used to fetch external code; file reading of 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'WindowsUpdate.py' via subprocess which executes remote code; deletion of the script afterward.",
  "flows": "The code fetches external code from the URL (source), saves it locally, and then executes it via subprocess (sink), then deletes the file.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command automatically downloads and runs a remote script during installation without any verification or user consent; use of 'shell=True' in subprocess call increases risk; hardcoded URL pointing to potentially malicious external script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom setup command that, during installation, downloads a script from an external source and executes it without any validation or user warning. The URL appears suspicious given its naming and source, and executing remote code directly during install poses a significant security risk. The process involves no checksums, signatures, or user prompts, which is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks. The rest of the setup script is standard and benign; the malicious behavior stems from the automatic remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote script during installation without validation, constituting a supply chain security threat. It should be considered unsafe for use in production or trusted environments.",
