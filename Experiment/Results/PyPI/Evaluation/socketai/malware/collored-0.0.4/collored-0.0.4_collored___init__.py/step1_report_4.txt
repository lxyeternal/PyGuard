  "purpose": "Re-exports the 'collored' module or symbol for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init' from '.collored'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a module re-export.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in the '__all__' list: 'collored' instead of 'colored' suggests a possible misspelling, but not malicious. No unusual code constructs, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines '__all__' to specify exportable symbols and imports 'init' from a relative module '.collored'. The typo in '__all__' may indicate a typo or a non-standard module name but does not suggest malicious intent. No inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. The only notable point is the typo in the module name, which appears to be a misspelling rather than malicious obfuscation.",
