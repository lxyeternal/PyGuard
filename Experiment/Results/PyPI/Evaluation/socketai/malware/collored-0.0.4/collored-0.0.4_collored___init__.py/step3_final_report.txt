{
  "purpose": "Define the public API of the module with an export list and import an initialization function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports 'init' from a local module '.collored'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in '__all__' as 'collored' instead of 'colored'; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with a typo in the export list that likely was unintended. It imports 'init' from a local module but does not execute any dynamic or malicious code. No external data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The typo does not introduce security vulnerabilities but could affect module export behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor typo in the export list, which does not pose security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects the typo's minor impact but does not indicate a security threat.",
