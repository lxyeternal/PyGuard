  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, configuring package metadata and directory context.",
  "sources": "Reads its own file path via __file__, uses static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data output.",
  "flows": "Static data used for setup; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.chdir() is typical; no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, conventional setup script with static metadata. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
