  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious behavior through obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The embedded URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting the package be treated as highly suspicious or malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the observed indicators."
