  "purpose": "A simple test function that prints a message, no clear malicious intent",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading functions present",
  "sinks": "No output sinks, network calls, or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function only prints static text",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a static string. It imports no external modules, performs no data processing, and contains no suspicious behavior. The referenced documentation URL suggests a potentially malicious module, but the actual code shown does not perform any malicious or suspicious actions. It appears to be a benign placeholder or minimal test function.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is harmless, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a trivial function that only prints a message and does not interact with external systems or data.",
