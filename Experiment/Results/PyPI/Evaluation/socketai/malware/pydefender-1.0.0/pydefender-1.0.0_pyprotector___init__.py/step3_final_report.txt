  "purpose": "Benign Python function with a comment referencing an external malicious-looking module",
  "sources": "No external data sources, only a print statement; comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip'",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code executes a simple print statement without external interactions",
  "anomalies": "Comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip' as a red herring; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a message, with no external dependencies or malicious logic. The comment referencing 'evilpip' is suspicious but does not impact code behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are solely due to the external reference, which does not reflect actual malicious activity. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and safe; external module review is recommended separately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The mention of 'evilpip' warrants further review of that external package but does not affect this snippet's safety. Scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence.",
