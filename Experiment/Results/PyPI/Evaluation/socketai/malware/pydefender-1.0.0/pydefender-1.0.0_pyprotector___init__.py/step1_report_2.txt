  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the function only performs a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal. The comment referencing 'github.com/codeuk/evilpip' could be a red flag if taken out of context, but as is, it appears to be a documentation note.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single function that prints a string. It does not process inputs, handle sensitive data, or invoke external systems.
