{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure and install the 'pydefender' Python package, including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, dependencies list, and project metadata. No untrusted data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The script writes package information and dependencies during installation. No sinks that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining package metadata and dependencies, with no external data or untrusted input processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The listed dependencies include libraries such as 'requests', 'discord_webhook', 'pyautogui', and 'browser_cookie3', which can potentially access or interact with system data, network, or user input. However, their inclusion alone in a setup script is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is evident. Dependencies are common and relate to automation, cryptography, web requests, and system interaction, typical for a package that might perform file obfuscation or system modification. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads within this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. All dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior on their own. The package appears intended for legitimate purposes related to file obfuscation and system automation.",
