  "conclusion": "The setup configuration is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the suspicious 'sockets' dependency, which should be verified or corrected. The overall security risk remains low, but the actual package implementation should be reviewed for malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.2-0.3."
