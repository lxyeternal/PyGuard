  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'pydefender', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; setup script is declarative.",
  "flows": "N/A; setup script does not execute runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'sockets' as a dependency (not a standard package), potential typo or malicious package; package description mentions obfuscation functionality, which could be misused.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a straightforward configuration with no executable code or malicious payloads. Dependencies such as 'requests', 'discord_webhook', 'pyautogui', etc., are common but could be misused if the package's runtime code is malicious. The listing of 'sockets' is suspicious since it is part of the Python standard library and should not be listed as an external dependency; this indicates a possible typo or misconfiguration. No obfuscation or malicious code is present in this script. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, with no code hiding detected. The security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting potential misuse of dependencies if the package code is malicious, but the setup script itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup configuration is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the suspicious 'sockets' dependency, which should be verified or corrected. The overall security risk remains low, but the actual package implementation should be reviewed for malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.2-0.3.",
