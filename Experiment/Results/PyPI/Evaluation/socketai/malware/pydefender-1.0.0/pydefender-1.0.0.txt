      "conclusion": "The setup configuration is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the suspicious 'sockets' dependency, which should be verified or corrected. The overall security risk remains low, but the actual package implementation should be reviewed for malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.2-0.3."

It exhibits classic malware traits such as layered decoding and eval-based execution, warranting a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1. It should be treated as malicious and handled accordingly."
