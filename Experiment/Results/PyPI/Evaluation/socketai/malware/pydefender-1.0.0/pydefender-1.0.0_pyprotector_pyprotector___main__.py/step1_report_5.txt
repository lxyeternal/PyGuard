{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python script likely designed for malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "The code reads multiple encoded strings and decodes them using custom functions, base64 decoding, and eval. It also decodes and executes further obfuscated payloads, including network or system commands.",
  "sinks": "Use of eval() with decoded strings, dynamic code execution, potential network communication, or system command execution embedded within decoded payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from encoded strings through decoding functions to eval() and exec() calls, potentially executing malicious code or commands. The flow involves decoding payloads and executing them dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code with multiple layers of decoding, dynamic execution of decoded payloads, and usage of eval() and exec() functions. Encoded data appears as hex and base64 strings, likely hiding malicious intent. The code imports and decodes payloads that could be malicious scripts or commands.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by assigning obfuscated strings and functions that decode and evaluate base64 and hex-encoded data. It decodes multiple layers of data—probably payloads or commands—and then executes them dynamically using eval() and exec(). The presence of multiple decoding layers, particularly with base64 and hex, indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads. The decoded payloads, once executed, may perform unauthorized system or network activities. The use of custom decoding functions and multiple eval() calls suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this script exhibits typical obfuscation techniques used in malicious scripts, including hiding payloads in encoded strings, dynamic code execution, and multiple decoding layers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and likely malicious, designed to decode and execute hidden payloads, potentially performing unauthorized or harmful activities. Its structure suggests an intent to evade detection while executing malicious commands or code on the target system.",
