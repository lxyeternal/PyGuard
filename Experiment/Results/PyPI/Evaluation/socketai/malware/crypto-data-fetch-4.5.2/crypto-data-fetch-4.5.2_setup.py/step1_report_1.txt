{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package named 'crypto-data-fetch'. It also executes a custom post-installation step that involves data collection and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and URLs in the send() function, which fetches data and files from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() calls, especially the download and execution of a file via os.system, which can lead to code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is used to send data to a remote server; then, a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that may lead to system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system environment info to an external server, downloading an executable file, and automatically executing it without user consent. The URL domains appear suspicious and unrelated to the package's stated purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and requests, and defines a send() function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to an external URL, then downloads and executes an executable file from another suspicious URL. This behavior occurs during the custom post-installation process. The use of 'os.system' to run an executable downloaded from an untrusted source is a significant security concern. The code does not perform any validation of the downloaded file, and the URL domains are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The overall structure suggests malicious activity disguised as a normal setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior including data exfiltration, downloading, and executing potentially harmful files during package installation. The suspicious URLs and system commands indicate an attempt to compromise the user's system. This package should be considered highly malicious.",
