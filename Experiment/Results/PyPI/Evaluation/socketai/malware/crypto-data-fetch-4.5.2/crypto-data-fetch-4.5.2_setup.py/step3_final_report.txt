{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information, download a malicious executable, and execute it during package installation, indicating malicious intent and potential supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; sending data via requests.get; downloading executable from untrusted URL; executing downloaded file with os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending system info to external server; executing arbitrary code from downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable) -> data exfiltration request; Download URL -> file saved locally -> os.system call to execute the file.",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during installation; downloading and executing untrusted external executable; use of suspicious URLs; no validation or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious activities including data exfiltration, downloading, and executing a payload from untrusted sources during setup. It uses environment variables and network requests to exfiltrate data, then downloads and runs an executable without validation, constituting clear malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious actions are explicit. The URLs are suspicious, and the behavior aligns with typical supply chain malware. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0.9-1, securityRisk: 0.9-1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate, but should be maximized to 1 given the severity. The behavior warrants the highest threat level, and the package should be flagged as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits confirmed malicious activity involving data exfiltration and remote code execution. The scores should be set to 1 for malware and security risk to accurately reflect the severity. The package is highly dangerous and should be considered malicious.",
