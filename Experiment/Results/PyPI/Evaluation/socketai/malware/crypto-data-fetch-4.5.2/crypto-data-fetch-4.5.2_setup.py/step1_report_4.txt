{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package called 'crypto-data-fetch' and perform post-installation actions, including sending environment information and downloading/executing a file.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and attempts to execute downloaded files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs can leak system info; executing downloaded files can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' → URL request with env info → Download of executable → Execution of downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system environment info to a suspicious domain and downloading/executing an executable from an untrusted source. No obfuscation or encrypted code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and requests, then defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this info via HTTP GET to 'linkedopports.com', then downloads an executable from 'python-release.com' and executes it if on Windows. This behavior is typical of malicious supply chain activity, as it exfiltrates system info and runs potentially harmful code during package installation. The setup function registers a custom install command that runs the 'send' function post-install. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are embedded in the package code itself, but the behavior triggered during install is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious actions by exfiltrating environment data and executing a remote file during package installation. It appears designed to compromise systems or deliver malware, representing a security threat.",
