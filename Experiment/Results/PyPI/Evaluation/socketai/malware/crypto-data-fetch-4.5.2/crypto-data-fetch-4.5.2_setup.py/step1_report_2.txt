  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'crypto-data-fetch' with a post-installation step that executes additional code.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', remote URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', and URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Fetching data from a remote URL, saving a file 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executing it via os.system.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET -> Downloads an executable -> Runs the executable.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send()' function contacts an external URL, retrieves an executable file, and executes it silently. The URL 'https://python-release.com' appears suspicious, and the filename suggests an executable download, which is risky. The code is designed to run on Windows and hides its activity within the installation process.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send()' function that retrieves an environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', appending the environment variable. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and executes it silently. This behavior indicates the download and execution of potentially malicious code during package installation. The class 'PostInstallCommand' overrides the 'run' method to call 'send()', ensuring the malicious steps are executed post-installation. The overall structure suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity within a seemingly legitimate setup script, making it highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by retrieving system information, contacting external servers, downloading, and executing an external executable during installation. This pattern indicates a supply chain attack vector or malicious backdoor embedded in the package. It should be considered high risk and unsafe for use.",
