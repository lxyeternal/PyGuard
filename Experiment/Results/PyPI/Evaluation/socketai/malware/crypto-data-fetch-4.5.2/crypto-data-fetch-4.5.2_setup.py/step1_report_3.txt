{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with an additional post-installation behavior that attempts to execute malicious actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs, and it executes a downloaded executable file.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs and execution of downloaded files using os.system, which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is included in an HTTP request URL, and if on Windows, a file is downloaded and executed, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional HTTP request sending environment data, downloading an executable from a suspicious URL, executing that file automatically, and the URL domains are suspicious (linkedopports.com, python-release.com). The try-except block suppresses errors, hiding potential failures or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defines a function 'send' that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this data to an external URL, indicating data leakage. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it without any user confirmation, representing a high security risk. The setup configuration registers a custom post-install command that invokes 'send', meaning this malicious activity occurs during package installation. The URLs used are suspicious and could host malware. The code does not sanitize or validate responses or downloads, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent by exfiltrating environment data and downloading/executing potentially harmful files during package installation. It should be considered highly malicious, with a security risk score approaching 1.",
