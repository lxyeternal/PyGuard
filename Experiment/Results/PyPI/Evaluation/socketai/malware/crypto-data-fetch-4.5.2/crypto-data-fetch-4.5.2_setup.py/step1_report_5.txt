{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and extends the installation process to include sending system information and downloading/executing a file from external URLs.",
  "sources": "os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'], requests.get() calls to external URLs",
  "sinks": "os.system() command execution of downloaded file",
  "flows": "Reading 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sending data via HTTP GET request -> Downloading executable -> Executing downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional request to external server with environment data, downloading and executing an external executable during installation, no input validation or restrictions",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from a potentially malicious domain and executes it silently. The PostInstallCommand class overrides the install process to run this 'send' function after installation. This behavior suggests the code is designed to exfiltrate system information and execute remote code, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious, and executing downloaded content without validation is dangerous. The setup configuration simply installs the package but triggers malicious behavior during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration and remote code execution. It appears intentionally designed to compromise the system during installation, indicating high malicious intent.",
