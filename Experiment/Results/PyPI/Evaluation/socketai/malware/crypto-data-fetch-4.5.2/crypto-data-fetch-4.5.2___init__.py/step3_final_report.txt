  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no external data, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
