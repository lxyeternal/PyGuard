{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() respectively.",
  "sinks": "Requests library makes an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with collected system information, which could leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits data to an external domain during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system info and sends it to an external server during installation without user consent or awareness. The URL appears suspicious and is used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setup process with a custom install class that, upon installation, gathers system details and sends them to a remote server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. No other malicious actions such as code injection or backdoors are present. The use of requests to send system info during package installation is suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. The external request to an untrusted server indicates data exfiltration, making this package potentially harmful.",
