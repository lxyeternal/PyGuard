  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (requests, socket, getpass, os); socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser(); requests.get() call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, hostname, current working directory, and username are collected and sent via HTTP GET request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and exfiltrates system information during install without explicit user consent. The URL used for exfiltration appears suspicious and is external. No obvious purpose related to package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing the standard installation, collects system data such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external domain via a GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. The exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL used appears suspicious and is not related to package functionality. The code does not have obfuscation or complex logic, but its intent to secretly send system info is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information during package installation without user knowledge or consent. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent, akin to data theft or surveillance. Therefore, it poses a significant security concern.",
