{
  "purpose": "Define and install a Python package with a custom installation process that sends system information to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(). It also imports modules requests, socket, getpass, and os.",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with system information as URL parameters during the installation process.",
  "flows": "Source: system information (hostname, current working directory, username) -> Sink: HTTP GET request to external server during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and transmits system details without user consent, during package installation, potentially for malicious purposes. No validation or user notification is present. The URL used is suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration. The code runs code during setup that is typically meant for benign package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for package setup and system info gathering. It defines a custom install command that, when run, executes the default installation process and then sends system details via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior is unusual for legitimate package installation, which generally avoids external network communication without explicit user consent. The URL appears suspicious and could be used for data collection or malicious tracking. The code does not sanitize or validate the data sent, nor does it notify the user, indicating potentially malicious intent or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, likely for tracking or data collection purposes. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious or at least potentially harmful.",
