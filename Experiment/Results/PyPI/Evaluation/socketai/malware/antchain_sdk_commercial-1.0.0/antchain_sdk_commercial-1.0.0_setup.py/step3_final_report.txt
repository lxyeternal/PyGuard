{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and sends it to an external server, indicating malicious data exfiltration behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from socket (hostname), os.getcwd() (current directory), and getpass.getuser() (username).",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits collected data to an external URL, acting as a sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, resulting in data transmission to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes data exfiltration during package installation without user notification, and the use of a suspicious external URL. The code is straightforward but performs covert data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, gathers system info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. This behavior is outside normal package installation practices and indicates privacy invasion and potential malicious activity. The code is not obfuscated, and no other malicious actions are present. The external URL and data exfiltration pattern strongly suggest malicious intent. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the direct evidence of data transmission during setup, aligning with supply chain attack characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs covert data exfiltration during installation, indicating malicious behavior. The external URL and data collection are suspicious, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
