  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sending data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits it to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of collecting system info during installation and exfiltrating it without explicit user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and unrelated to package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. Instead of just installing, it makes an HTTP GET request to an external domain, sending this information as URL parameters. This behavior is outside typical package installation and indicates potential data exfiltration. The URL 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' is suspicious and suggests malicious intent or at least undesirable tracking/monitoring behavior. No other malicious code or obfuscated logic is present. The external call is made during install, which is a common tactic for malicious supply chain attacks or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user awareness, indicating potential malicious intent and privacy violation. The URL used further supports suspicion. Overall, this code is likely malicious.",
