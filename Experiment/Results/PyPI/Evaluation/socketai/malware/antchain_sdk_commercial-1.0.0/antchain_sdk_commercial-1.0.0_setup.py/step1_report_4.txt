{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation process that sends system information to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits collected system data to external server",
  "flows": "source data (hostname, cwd, username) collected during installation -> sent via HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "The requests.get() call occurs unconditionally during package installation, transmitting potentially sensitive system info without user consent or notification. No validation or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends these details to a hardcoded external server via a GET request. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The request URL is suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. There are no obfuscation techniques or error handling, and the code executes during normal package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during installation without user consent. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential security risk, indicating malicious intent.",
