{
  "purpose": "A placeholder function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' are inputs; no data reading beyond function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the function body is empty, so no data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur within the function body since it contains only a pass statement.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation, which could be suspicious if intended to handle sensitive data. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with three parameters but does not implement any logic or data processing. The lack of implementation means there are no apparent malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues. Its simplicity suggests it is either a placeholder or incomplete. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple stub for a message-sending function with no actual logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. Its purpose is likely to be implemented later.",
