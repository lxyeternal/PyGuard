  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (inputs from external sources)",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks; the function body is empty and does not perform any actions",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within the function body as it is empty",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; no anomalies within this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function intended to send messages but lacks implementation. There are no suspicious code behaviors, data leaks, or malicious activities evident. The presence of parameters suggests potential input data, but without any logic or data handling, it cannot be malicious or insecure. No external dependencies, environment variables, or code injections are present. The code appears to be a placeholder or stub.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple placeholder function with no operational code. It presents no malicious behavior or security risks, but it also does not perform any actual message sending.",
