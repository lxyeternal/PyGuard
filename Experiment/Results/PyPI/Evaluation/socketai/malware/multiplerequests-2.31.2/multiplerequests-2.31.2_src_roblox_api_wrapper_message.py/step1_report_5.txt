  "purpose": "A function intended to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "None explicitly shown; potential for future implementation to send data over network or store",
  "flows": "Parameters passed to the send function; no actual data flow or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Function body is empty (pass statement), providing no actual implementation or logic; no code to evaluate for malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send function with three parameters but contains no implementation. It appears as a placeholder or stub. Without implementation details, there are no observable security risks, data flows, or anomalies beyond an empty function definition. No external data sources or sinks are invoked, and there are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal stub with no operational logic. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It serves as a placeholder for message sending functionality and does not pose any security risks in its current state.",
