{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended for message sending, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (no data reading in current form).",
  "sinks": "None, as the function does not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; function is a stub with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward stub with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty function 'send' with parameters but no implementation, indicating a placeholder. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify it as a non-functional stub. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the code's benign, incomplete state. The minimal risk score accounts for potential future misuse if replaced with malicious code, but in its current form, it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, unimplemented placeholder with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are justified; the risk score could be lowered to 0, but 0.1 remains acceptable as a conservative measure. Overall, the code is safe in its present state.",
