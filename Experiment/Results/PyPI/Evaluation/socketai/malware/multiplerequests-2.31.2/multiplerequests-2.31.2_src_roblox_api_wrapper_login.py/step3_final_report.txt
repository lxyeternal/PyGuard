  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API interactions, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie' in cookielogin; 'username' and 'password' in userpasslogin.",
  "sinks": "None, as functions do not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; functions are empty and do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain only 'pass' statements; no implementation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two placeholder functions intended for login operations, accepting input parameters but performing no actions. There are no data processing, network calls, or malicious behaviors present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Given their current state, they pose no security risk or malware threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate, reflecting minimal concern due to their placeholder nature. The high confidence scores (around 0.8-1) are justified, as the code is clearly non-functional and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless placeholder functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues in its current form. The reports accurately identify this and assign appropriate low scores. Future implementation could introduce risks if malicious code is added, but presently, the code is safe.",
