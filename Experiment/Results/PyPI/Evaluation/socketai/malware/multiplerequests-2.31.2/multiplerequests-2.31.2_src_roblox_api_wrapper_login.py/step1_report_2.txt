  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into roblox.com API using cookies or username/password.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', and 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; functions are empty and do not process data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur as the functions are empty and do not execute any logic.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation. No anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for login purposes but neither function contains any executable code or logic. There are no data processing, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. The functions appear as placeholders without malicious intent or behavior. Given their empty implementation, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is merely placeholder function definitions with no operational code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a scaffold for future implementation.",
