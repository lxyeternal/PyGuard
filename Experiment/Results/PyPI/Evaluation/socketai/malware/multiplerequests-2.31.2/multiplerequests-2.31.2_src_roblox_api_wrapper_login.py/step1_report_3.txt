  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into the Roblox API using either cookie or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' which are inputs that could be untrusted data if provided externally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the current code, as the functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur because the functions are not implemented and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are empty with no implementation, no validation, no network calls, and no processing logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two stub functions intended for login purposes but currently do nothing. There are no code executions, no data processing, or network activities. The functions are placeholders, which by themselves do not pose any security risk or malicious intent. However, if used in a larger context, the absence of implementation might suggest incomplete or intentionally hidden behavior, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely placeholder functions with no operational content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
