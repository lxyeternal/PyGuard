{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to provide functions for logging into the Roblox API using either a cookie or username/password.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' are the only data inputs; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or sensitive data exposure in the current implementation.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows or data processing within the functions as they only contain 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "Both functions are empty and do not perform any operations, data processing, or network activity. No code execution, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two function definitions with descriptive comments but contains no implementation. The functions do not process, store, or transmit data. Their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. However, placeholders for login procedures could be used maliciously if later implemented to capture credentials or cookies, but as-is, there is no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no active functionality or malicious behavior. It appears to be a template for future login functions without any suspicious or malicious code at this point.",
