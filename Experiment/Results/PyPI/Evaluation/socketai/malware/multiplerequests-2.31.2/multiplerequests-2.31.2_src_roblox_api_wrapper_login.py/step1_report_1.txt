  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into the Roblox API using cookies or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' in the functions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the functions are empty and do not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no execution flows or data flows within this code since the functions do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are defined but contain no implementation. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty function definitions with no internal logic, input processing, or data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. Since these are placeholders, they do not execute any actions or pose security risks. The code structure is simple, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional placeholder code with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a stub for future implementation. No malicious behavior or security concerns are identified based on this code fragment.",
