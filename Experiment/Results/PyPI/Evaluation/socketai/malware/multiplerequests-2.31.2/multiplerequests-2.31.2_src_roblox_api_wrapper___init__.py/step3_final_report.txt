{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external modules/files, and possibly network or file operations if untrusted data is used.",
  "sinks": "Network functions, file writes, or subprocess calls that could handle untrusted data, but none are explicitly present or malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables into processing functions, with potential outputs to network or files, but no malicious payloads are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code structure is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks suspicious imports or behaviors. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Network communication, if present, appears benign and limited to internal or environment data. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). No malicious or obfuscated code detected. Security risk is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent with the observed characteristics. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
