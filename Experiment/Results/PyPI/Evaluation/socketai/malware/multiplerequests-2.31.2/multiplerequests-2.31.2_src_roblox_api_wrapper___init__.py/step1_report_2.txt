{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package, possibly for data processing or utility functions, as inferred from the structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and potentially external modules or files imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console, files, or network connections; specific sinks are not clearly identified due to the absence of explicit network code or file operations in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions and potentially to output or external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are immediately apparent. The code structure and variable naming appear standard. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and function definitions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features. The lack of network code or system modification functions reduces suspicion. Given the incomplete fragment, no malicious patterns such as data theft, system damage, or hidden backdoors are visible. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears normal and safe, with no suspicious activities detected.",
