  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, potentially harmful PowerShell payload during package installation. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL justify high malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or compromised pending further payload analysis."
