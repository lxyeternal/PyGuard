  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell execution triggered during package installation, with external URL references and silent error handling. The high suspicion and obfuscation justify elevated malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
