      "conclusion": "The script contains embedded, obfuscated PowerShell code triggered during setup, referencing a suspicious URL, and executed covertly. This indicates high likelihood of malicious intent, warranting classification as high risk and malware potential. The scores assigned in reports are appropriate; overall, the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
