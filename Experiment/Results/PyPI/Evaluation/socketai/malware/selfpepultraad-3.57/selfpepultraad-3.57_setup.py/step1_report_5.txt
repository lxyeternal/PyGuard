{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package called 'selfpepultraad' with a specified package and metadata, and includes an obfuscated subprocess command that runs a PowerShell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment, file existence, and executes a subprocess with a command string that is encoded and obfuscated.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess with encoded PowerShell command, which if decoded, could execute malicious code or commands.",
  "flows": "The code checks for a directory, then conditionally runs an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, and proceeds to call setup for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command in subprocess, use of try-except blocks swallowing exceptions without logging, and the inclusion of potentially malicious code that appears designed to run hidden commands.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a package setup for a package named 'selfpepultraad' with author details and classifiers. Before setup, it attempts to run a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is obfuscated to hide its true purpose. The command is executed with 'shell=False' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, indicating an intention to run silently. The try-except blocks suppress errors, providing no feedback. The presence of the encoded command and its execution method are typical indicators of malicious behavior or a backdoor, especially given the obfuscation. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are visible. The overall structure suggests an attempt to secretly execute code during installation, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that executes during setup, which strongly suggests malicious intent or a backdoor. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the embedded obfuscated command indicates a high risk of malicious activity.",
