      "conclusion": "This package contains highly suspicious and potentially malicious code intended to execute arbitrary, decrypted payloads during installation on Windows. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting it to be classified as malware. It should be flagged, avoided, and further analyzed to determine the payload's nature."
