  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring installation details and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'requests', 'fernet', and reads environment data via os.name; also uses hardcoded encrypted data in Fernet decryption.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code with exec(); potentially executes malicious code upon decryption if remote or malicious data is embedded.",
  "flows": "If OS is Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts hardcoded encrypted data, and executes it dynamically via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed dynamically with exec(); package name appears nonsensical; decryption key and payload are hardcoded; the code executes potentially malicious code during installation on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The script imports essential setup modules, defines package metadata, and creates a custom install class with a run() method. Inside run(), it checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it via exec(). The encrypted data and key are hardcoded, suggesting obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, indicating malicious intent, especially since the payload is encrypted and executed only on Windows. The package name and description appear nonsensical, further raising suspicion. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with malicious activity, executing arbitrary code during installation, which can be a backdoor or malware delivery method.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious potential due to encrypted payload execution during installation on Windows systems. It appears intentionally obfuscated and designed to run arbitrary code, constituting malicious behavior with significant security risk.",
