{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a hardcoded payload, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded encrypted payloads and cryptographic keys within the script.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts the payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and then executes it directly, creating a source-to-sink flow from the encrypted data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and variable names, hardcoded cryptographic keys, encrypted payloads, and runtime execution of decrypted code during package installation on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that, on Windows, decrypts a concealed payload and executes it during installation. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution pattern are typical of malicious software designed to hide its intent and execute arbitrary code. The use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and encrypted data indicates an attempt to conceal malicious actions. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks that justify such behavior, and the pattern aligns with supply chain malware or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains highly suspicious and potentially malicious code intended to execute arbitrary, decrypted payloads during installation on Windows. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting it to be classified as malware. It should be flagged, avoided, and further analyzed to determine the payload's nature.",
