  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating likely malicious activity. The supply chain is potentially compromised, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload. The high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and risk (0.8) scores are justified based on the evidence."
