  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, with a suspicious URL embedded. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity, posing significant security risks. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified. Immediate investigation, decoding of the payload, and cautious handling are recommended."
