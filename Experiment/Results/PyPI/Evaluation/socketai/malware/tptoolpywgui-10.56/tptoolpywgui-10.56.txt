      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth, and error suppression justify a malware score of 0.8, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.8. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
