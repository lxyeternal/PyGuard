      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The silent error handling and conditional execution are typical of malicious payload delivery mechanisms. The scores in the reports are justified; I recommend assigning a malware score of 0.85, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9 to reflect the high likelihood of malicious activity."
