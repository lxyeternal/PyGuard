      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating potential malicious intent such as payload download or backdoor installation. The setup code itself appears benign, but the hidden execution raises high security concern. The overall risk is high, and further analysis of the payload is recommended."
