  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity through obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell payload execution during package setup. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL comment justify high malware and security risk scores. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further payload decoding confirms benign intent."
