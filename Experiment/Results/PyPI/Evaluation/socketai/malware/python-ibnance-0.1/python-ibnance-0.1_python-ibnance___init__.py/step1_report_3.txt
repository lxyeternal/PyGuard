  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some operations involving data processing, potentially involving external inputs or dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input functions or data reads from environment variables, user input, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to files, network connections, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or commands), possibly through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hard-coded credentials, suspicious function calls, dynamic execution like eval or exec, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows standard import statements and straightforward function definitions. No hardcoded secrets are visible. The code uses input() functions, which are typical data sources. There are no signs of malicious network connections, data exfiltration, or system damage. No usage of eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution methods detected. The structure appears normal without obfuscation or unusual language features. Dependencies are standard or unremarkable. The flow from input to output appears benign, but without specific details of external interactions or full context, minor concerns remain regarding input handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with standard practices. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns identified. Overall, the code seems safe, but a more detailed review of external dependencies and full context could improve certainty.",
