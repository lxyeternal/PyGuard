  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as safe with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustments to risk scores (e.g., lowering from 0.2 to 0.1) could be considered for more conservative assessment, but current scores are reasonable."
