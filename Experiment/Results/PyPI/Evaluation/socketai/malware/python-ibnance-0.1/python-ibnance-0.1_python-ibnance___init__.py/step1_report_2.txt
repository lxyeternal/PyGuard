  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or module, but the specific functionality is not provided due to the absence of code in the input.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include any input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or network requests present in the code. Since no code is provided, no explicit sources can be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. No such sinks are observable in the absence of code.",
  "flows": "Without specific code, there are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detectable without code. The provided input is empty.",
  "analysis": "The analysis cannot proceed without actual code content. No functions, variables, or logic are available for review. Therefore, no security issues, anomalies, or malicious behaviors can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code sample is empty or missing, preventing any meaningful analysis.",
