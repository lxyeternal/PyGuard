  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or manipulation tasks, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input, environment variables, or external files (though explicit source code is not provided in the prompt).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing operations, or subprocess calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, file systems, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are present in the provided snippet. However, without the actual code, this cannot be definitively confirmed.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of actual code content. The structure indicates standard practices, but without specific code lines, it is impossible to identify malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious flows. Further code details are necessary for a thorough review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, no malicious behavior or security risks are detectable. The code appears benign, but the lack of specific code prevents a definitive assessment. Additional code details are required for a comprehensive review.",
