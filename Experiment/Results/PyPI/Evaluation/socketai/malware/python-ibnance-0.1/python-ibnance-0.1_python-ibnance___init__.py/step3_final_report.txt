  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, data handling, network calls, environment variables, and external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, eval()/exec() calls, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system, eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are cautious but acceptable, considering potential external input handling. Confidence levels are appropriate based on available data. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as safe with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustments to risk scores (e.g., lowering from 0.2 to 0.1) could be considered for more conservative assessment, but current scores are reasonable.",
