  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, containing a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that could be malicious. The setup script's benign appearance masks potentially harmful activity. Given the obfuscation, conditional execution, and concealment tactics, this package should be treated as potentially malicious with high severity. Further analysis, such as decoding the PowerShell payload, is recommended before deployment."
