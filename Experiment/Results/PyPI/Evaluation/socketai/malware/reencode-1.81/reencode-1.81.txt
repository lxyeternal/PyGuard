      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, linked to external domains. The pattern suggests malicious activity, justifying high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
