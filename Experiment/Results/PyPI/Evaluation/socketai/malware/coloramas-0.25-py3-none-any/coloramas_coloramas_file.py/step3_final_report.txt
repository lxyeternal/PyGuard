{
  "purpose": "The code collects Exodus wallet files and related sensitive data, packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram API, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Wallet configuration files, seed, passphrase, and other wallet-related files; environment variables for user directories; external IP and country API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents; file system for creating and deleting ZIP archives.",
  "flows": "Reads sensitive files and environment variables -> creates ZIP archive -> retrieves IP and geolocation info -> constructs message with IP and country flag -> sends message and ZIP via Telegram API -> deletes ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of sensitive wallet files without user consent; external IP and country info collection; silent exception handling during file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script actively searches for and collects sensitive wallet data and configuration files from user directories, packages them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data along with IP and geolocation information via Telegram using hardcoded credentials. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs stealthy data theft without user awareness. The presence of hardcoded credentials, active collection of private data, and external communication strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code's logic aligns with typical exfiltration malware targeting cryptocurrency wallets, with no benign explanation for such actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and user IP information via Telegram, with hardcoded credentials and no user consent. It qualifies as high-severity malware with maximum security risk. The behavior is consistent with known exfiltration and privacy-violating malware, warranting immediate concern and removal.",
