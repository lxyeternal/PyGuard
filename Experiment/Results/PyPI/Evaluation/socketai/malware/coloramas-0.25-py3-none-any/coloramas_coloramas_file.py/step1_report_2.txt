{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive information related to Exodus wallet files from a user's system, package them into a ZIP archive, and then upload and send this information to a specified Telegram bot, likely for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), filesystem paths related to Exodus wallet data and configuration files, network requests to obtain external IP and country code, and reading files for zipping and uploading.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages and files via Telegram API endpoints, reading local files for exfiltration, and creating ZIP files containing potentially sensitive wallet data.",
  "flows": "System data (wallet files, configs) is read from user directories -> packaged into ZIP -> read as binary -> uploaded via Telegram bot API -> messages and documents are sent to attacker-controlled chat ID.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of multiple sensitive wallet-related files; use of requests to send data to an external server; the code actively packages and exfiltrates wallet data without user consent; naming conventions and structure suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by retrieving the current username and setting hardcoded credentials for Telegram API access. It constructs paths to wallet-related files and checks their existence. If found, it creates a ZIP archive containing these files, with multiple exception handling blocks to ensure all data is included regardless of individual errors. It also retrieves external IP and country code information, converting country code to flag emojis, and constructs a message indicating wallet data collection. This message, along with the ZIP file containing sensitive wallet files, is then sent via Telegram bot API, suggesting an intent to exfiltrate sensitive user data stealthily. The use of hardcoded tokens, active file collection, and external communication indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious exfiltration tool targeting Exodus wallet files. It collects sensitive wallet data, packages it into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive files, and external data transmission strongly suggest malicious intent with high security risk. The overall risk score is high due to the active data theft mechanism and unconsented data collection.",
