{
  "purpose": "The script collects sensitive Exodus wallet data, compresses it, and exfiltrates it via Telegram, potentially for malicious theft of wallet information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), wallet and config file paths, IP address via external API, files related to Exodus wallet.",
  "sinks": "Telegram Bot API endpoints for sending messages and documents, file system operations for creating and deleting zip files.",
  "flows": "Read environment variables and wallet files -> Package files into zip -> Send IP info and wallet data via Telegram -> Remove temporary zip file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, inclusion of wallet-related files and sensitive data, collection and exfiltration of IP address, dynamic creation and deletion of zip files for exfiltration, use of requests to send data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by retrieving system information and sensitive wallet data from specific paths associated with the Exodus wallet. It constructs a zip archive containing wallet configuration, seed, passphrase, and other sensitive files. It also gathers the external IP address and country code, then creates a message including this data and the country flag derived from the country code. The script then sends this information and the zip file to a Telegram bot specified by hardcoded credentials. The overall behavior aligns with data theft, potentially malicious, as it exfiltrates sensitive user wallet data and IP information without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and IP address via Telegram. It appears designed to harvest and transmit wallet credentials and associated data surreptitiously, indicating malicious behavior. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the collection of sensitive user data reinforce this conclusion.",
