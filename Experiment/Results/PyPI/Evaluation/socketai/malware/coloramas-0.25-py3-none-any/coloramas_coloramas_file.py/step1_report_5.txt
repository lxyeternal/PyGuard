{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user data related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet files and personal information, then compresses and exfiltrates this data via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Gets user name from getpass.getuser(); reads environment variables for local data paths; accesses various files in the user's appdata and desktop directories; makes HTTP requests to IP geolocation API.",
  "sinks": "Sends a message and a document to a Telegram bot API endpoint, effectively exfiltrating collected data.",
  "flows": "Collects wallet-related files and sensitive info, compresses them into a zip file, retrieves external IP and location info, constructs a message including country flag and IP, then posts message and zip file to Telegram, and deletes the zip.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet files and credentials; dynamic URL requests for IP info; concatenation of user-specific paths; no user consent or indication of benign intent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user-specific wallet and password files from the filesystem, including configuration, seed, passphrase, and wallet info, then compresses these into a zip archive. It fetches the current IP address and country code from external services, constructs a message with a country flag emoji, and exfiltrates the data by sending the message and the zip file to a Telegram bot API. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID, along with the collection of sensitive data without user knowledge, indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any benign or intended functionality beyond data theft. It does not appear obfuscated but is designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data. The exfiltration process uses HTTP POST requests to Telegram API, which can be malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive wallet and personal data from the user’s machine, package it, and exfiltrate it via Telegram. The hardcoded credentials and the nature of data collection strongly suggest malicious intent with a focus on privacy violation and data theft.",
