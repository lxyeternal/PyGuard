  "purpose": "Setup script for terminal coloring using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module 'coloramas_file' and external 'colorama'; call to 'initialize()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and 'initialize()' are straightforward; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from both modules; local module named 'coloramas_file' resembles 'colorama' but is misspelled, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup for terminal coloring, importing all symbols from a local module and 'colorama', then calling 'initialize()'. The local module name 'coloramas_file' is unusual and warrants further inspection but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The wildcard import is a minor concern but common in setup scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the suspicious module name but lack of evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily a setup for terminal coloring. The main concern is the local module 'coloramas_file', which should be reviewed to confirm it is safe. No malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
