      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively exfiltrating sensitive wallet data and user IP information via Telegram, with hardcoded credentials and no user consent. It qualifies as high-severity malware with maximum security risk. The behavior is consistent with known exfiltration and privacy-violating malware, warranting immediate concern and removal."
