  "obfuscated": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, characterized by extensive data collection, environment fingerprinting, remote exfiltration, and package management routines that could be exploited for malicious payloads. The scores in the reports are justified; a malware score around 0.85, high security risk (~0.85), and low obfuscation (~0.1) accurately reflect its threat level."
