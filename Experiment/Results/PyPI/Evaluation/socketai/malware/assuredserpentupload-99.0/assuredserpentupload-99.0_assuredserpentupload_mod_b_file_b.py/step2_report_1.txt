  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple function that prints a static message. The original code provided is:\n```python\ndef function_b():\n    print('This is function_b')\n```\nThis matches the descriptions in all reports. There are no discrepancies or overlooked issues; the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, malicious activity, or obfuscation.  \n- They correctly identify that there are no data flows, external inputs, or suspicious operations.  \n- The analysis and conclusions are consistent and accurate.  \n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, `malware: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- The confidence score is 1 in all cases, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- No justification is needed for higher scores since there's no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`, indicating no malicious activity detected.  \n- This is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they rely on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.  \n- Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a trivial function that prints a static message, with no data handling, external communication, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
