  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; only a print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static code with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that outputs a fixed string. All reports confirm the absence of data inputs, external dependencies, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No discrepancies or issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
