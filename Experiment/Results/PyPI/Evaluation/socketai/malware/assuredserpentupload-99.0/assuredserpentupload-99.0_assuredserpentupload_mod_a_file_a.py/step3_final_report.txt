  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message, serving as a benign utility or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or data sources; static code with no data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs a message to standard output, with no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a fixed string. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and benign nature. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's straightforward behavior. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
