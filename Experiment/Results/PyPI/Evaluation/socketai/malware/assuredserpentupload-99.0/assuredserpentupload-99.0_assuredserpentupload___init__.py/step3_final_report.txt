  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution, network operations, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from untrusted inputs to sensitive operations, network transmissions, or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parsing or environment variables leading to sinks like network connections or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names, suspicious URLs/IPs.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, and suspicious network activity, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.8), and risk (0.75) scores. Reports 2 and 4 lack code, thus scores are zero and justified. Reports 3 and 5 describe benign code with no suspicious patterns, scoring malware 0, obfuscated 0, and low risk (0.2). All scores are consistent with descriptions. The suspicion in Report 1 is well-supported by the indicators; other reports appropriately reflect their benign or absent status.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1's high scores are justified due to obfuscation and suspicious patterns. Other reports correctly assign low or zero scores consistent with their benign or absent code. No adjustments necessary; scoring aligns with analysis.",
