{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python module designed for data processing or utility functions, but without further context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly observed in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through functions, but without external calls or network operations, no malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs with typical use of variables, functions, and modules. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. The structure is conventional, and no obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads are present. Absence of external inputs leading to dangerous sinks suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious anomalies.",
