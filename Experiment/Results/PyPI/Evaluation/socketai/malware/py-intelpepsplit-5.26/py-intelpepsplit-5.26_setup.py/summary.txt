  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, indicative of malicious intent. It likely serves as a vector for malware or backdoor installation, posing a serious security risk. Decoding the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence justifies treating this as malicious."
