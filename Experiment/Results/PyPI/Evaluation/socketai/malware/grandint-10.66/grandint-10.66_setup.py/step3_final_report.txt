  "purpose": "Detects execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",

  "flows": "Directory existence check -> conditional execution of encoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command, execution in hidden window, silent error handling suppressing failures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory check, and if 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags, suppressing errors. The command is obfuscated, suggesting malicious intent. The setup() function appears standard, but the malicious payload execution is suspicious. The broad try-except blocks conceal failures, increasing risk. The obfuscation and hidden execution are classic indicators of malicious activity, such as backdoors or data exfiltration. The high scores assigned in reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscated: ~0.9, security risk: ~0.9) are justified by these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious intent through obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup. The package should be treated as malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms benign behavior. The high scores across reports are consistent with the observed suspicious activity.",
