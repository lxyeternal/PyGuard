{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'grandint' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading of the 'distutils.core' module, import of 'subprocess' and 'os', checking for the existence of 'tahg' directory, and the encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, and the setup configuration for package installation.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg', then potentially executes a PowerShell command if the directory does not exist, and proceeds with package setup. The encoded PowerShell command is a source-to-sink flow that executes without user visibility.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in Base64, executed via subprocess with hidden window flags. No clear purpose for this command is provided, and it could potentially be malicious. The setup process itself appears normal, but the encoded command is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a standard import from 'distutils.core' for package setup. It then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os', and checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If not found, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, hidden from the user. The command is suspicious due to its obfuscation and execution method. The setup call is standard, defining package metadata, with no immediate security issues. The use of encoded PowerShell commands suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity or perform unauthorized actions upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "While the package setup appears legitimate, the presence of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command executed during the script raises significant suspicion. This could be an attempt to run malicious code covertly during installation. Further investigation of the decoded PowerShell command is recommended to determine its purpose. Overall, the code exhibits potentially malicious behavior with a high malware score.",
