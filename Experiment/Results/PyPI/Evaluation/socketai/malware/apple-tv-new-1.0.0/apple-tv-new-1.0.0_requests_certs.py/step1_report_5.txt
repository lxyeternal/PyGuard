  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package",
  "sources": "Imports 'where' from certifi, reads CA bundle location with 'print(where())'",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the CA bundle path to standard output",
  "flows": "Source: 'where' import -> Function call 'where()' -> Output via 'print()'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code straightforwardly outputs a trusted CA bundle path; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'where' from the certifi package, which returns a trusted CA bundle path. When executed directly, it prints this path. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no suspicious data flows, or manipulative code. The code's purpose is to provide the location of a standard CA bundle, which is a common practice for network security and not malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script designed to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
