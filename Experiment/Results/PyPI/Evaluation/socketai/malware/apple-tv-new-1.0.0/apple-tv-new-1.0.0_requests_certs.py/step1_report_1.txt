{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package's where() function to obtain the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The path returned by where() could be used by other parts of an application to verify SSL certificates; no direct sink that leads to malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() to get the CA bundle path and prints it to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward operation without unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports certifi and prints the default CA bundle location, which is standard behavior for SSL verification support. It includes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The structure is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for retrieving and displaying the default CA bundle location used by requests. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
