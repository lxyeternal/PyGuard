  "sinks": "Outputting the CA bundle path to the console; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply retrieves and prints a file path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, certifi, and outputs the default CA bundle location. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data manipulation, and no network activity. The structure is straightforward and appears to be a utility script. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple utility to print the default CA certificate bundle path. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and performs a benign function.",
