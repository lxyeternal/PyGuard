  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle path used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' and the call to 'where()' function.",
  "sinks": "Output of the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> call to 'where()' -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its result. It performs no data manipulation, network activity, or untrusted input handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's functionality and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the trusted CA bundle path. There is no malicious intent or security risk. The code is straightforward, trusted, and safe, with scores accurately reflecting its benign nature.",
