{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package, primarily for verification of SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package by importing the where() function, which returns the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path to standard output using print(). There are no other sinks.",
  "flows": "The source (import of where()) provides the path to the CA bundle, which is then printed to the console when the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard library and third-party package functions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, which is a standard way to obtain the trusted CA bundle used for SSL verification. When executed as a standalone program, it prints this path to the console. The code contains no input handling, no data manipulation, and no network activity or cryptographic operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present. The purpose appears to be utility in determining the CA bundle location, which is common in SSL-related scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a standard operation for SSL certificate verification purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs the path to the CA bundle provided by the certifi package.",
