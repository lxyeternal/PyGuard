{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to return the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the certifi package via the 'where' function imported from certifi.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves the CA bundle path, which is then printed; no untrusted input flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected; simple function call and output.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to obtain the default CA bundle location. It then prints this path when executed as the main module. The code is straightforward, with no input validation, external data manipulation, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. It merely outputs a known, static resource path from a trusted library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a straightforward purpose of returning the CA bundle path used for SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
