  "purpose": "Utility data structures for handling HTTP headers and key lookups within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Internal data storage and retrieval in class methods; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; purely internal data management.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and accessed within class instances; no external flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Minor quirk in 'copy()' method of 'CaseInsensitiveDict' returning 'self._store.values()' instead of a proper copy, which may cause unexpected behavior but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: 'CaseInsensitiveDict' and 'LookupDict'. Both are standard implementations of dictionary-like structures, with 'CaseInsensitiveDict' handling case-insensitive keys by lowercasing them internally. No external input, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The only notable point is the 'copy()' method in 'CaseInsensitiveDict', which returns 'self._store.values()' instead of a proper copy, potentially leading to unexpected behavior but not security issues. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common patterns, indicating a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of internal data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor quirk in the 'copy()' method does not pose a security threat but could be improved for correctness. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose within the Requests library.",
