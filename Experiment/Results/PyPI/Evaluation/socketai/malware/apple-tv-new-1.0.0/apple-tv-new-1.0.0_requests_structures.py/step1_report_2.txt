{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup dictionaries in the Requests library, specifically case-insensitive and flexible dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item setting (__setitem__), item retrieval (__getitem__, get), and string representations (__repr__) that access internal data stores.",
  "sinks": "Potential data access points via __getitem__, get, and iteration over dictionaries; no direct sink for untrusted data affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in internal structures (OrderedDict, dict), retrieved via __getitem__ or get methods, and represented via __repr__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The code performs standard dictionary manipulations and data storage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom dictionary-like objects with case-insensitivity and flexible key retrieval. It relies on standard library data structures (OrderedDict, dict). No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. Methods are straightforward and adhere to expected behaviors for data handling. No signs of malicious logic or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility data structures with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious components.",
