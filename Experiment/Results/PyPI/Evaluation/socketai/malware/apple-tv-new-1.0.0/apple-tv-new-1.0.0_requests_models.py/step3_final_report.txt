  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses, including encoding, hooks, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as method, url, headers, data, json, files, cookies, hooks, and auth; URL parsing; request body encoding; cookie jar processing.",
  "sinks": "Request body, headers, cookies, hooks, and response content; potential data leakage if untrusted data is mishandled, but handled securely here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request and response objects; URL parsing and encoding lead to request construction; response content is streamed and decoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected; standard practices followed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client library. It performs proper validation, encoding, and error handling. No signs of malicious routines, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are typical for such libraries, and the use of trusted modules reduces risk. No network connections to suspicious domains or malicious payloads are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of request/response handling with no malware or obfuscation. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate given its nature as a core HTTP library component. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior.",
