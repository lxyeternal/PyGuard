  "purpose": "This module defines core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks provided during request initialization or through property setters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows could occur when user-provided input is encoded into request URLs, headers, body content, or cookies, and then transmitted over the network. Potential sink points include request URL, headers, body, form-data, cookies, and hooks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input (URL, headers, data, files, JSON, cookies, hooks) flow through request preparation methods: prepare_url (URL), prepare_headers (headers), prepare_body (data/files/json), prepare_cookies (cookies), and hooks registration. These processed components are assembled into a PreparedRequest object, which is then sent over the network. No direct or implicit data flows to external or malicious domains are evident in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured library code for HTTP request/response handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution (like eval or exec) is used. The import statements are typical, and the logic aligns with normal request processing. There are no signs of malicious privacy violations or unauthorized data exfiltration in this code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for creating and preparing HTTP requests, including encoding parameters, files, handling cookies, and setting headers. Response class manages response data, headers, encoding detection, and error handling. All methods are consistent with typical HTTP client implementations, with no suspicious or malicious logic. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are utility and setup routines, with no indications of malicious intent. The overall code maintains security and correctness in context, with no evident malware or vulnerabilities introduced by this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard component of the Requests library for managing HTTP requests and responses. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious features. It performs expected operations for a request/response handling library without introducing security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
