{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various errors and warnings related to HTTP requests made using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statements and class initializations, particularly during exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute accesses may process untrusted data, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code creates exception instances and assigns attributes based on input arguments, with no complex data flow or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily defines classes and constructors without executing external commands or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions for various HTTP-related exceptions, with constructors that initialize attributes based on parameters. It imports standard exceptions and extends them appropriately. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears standard and straightforward, serving as part of a robust error handling system for the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for a HTTP request library. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detectable from this code.",
