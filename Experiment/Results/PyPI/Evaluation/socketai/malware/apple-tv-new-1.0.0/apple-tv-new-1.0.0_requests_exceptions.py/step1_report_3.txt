{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; no external or user input data read explicitly.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute assignments within exception constructors; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling logic is standard and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for handling network and request errors in the Requests library. It imports exception classes from other modules and defines subclasses for specific error scenarios, including JSON decoding, HTTP errors, timeouts, and warnings. No external data input, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception hierarchy with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
