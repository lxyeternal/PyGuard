  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely definitional, consisting of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- No external data processing, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors.\n- The code imports standard exceptions and defines subclasses with straightforward constructors.\n- The scores assigned are consistently low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and security risk at 0.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches standard exception class definitions for a request library.\n   - No issues or anomalies are detected in the code logic or structure.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is safe and intended for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - None identified. The constructors and class hierarchies are standard and correct.\n   - The import statements are straightforward, and the class implementations are typical.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: all assign 0, which is correct.\n   - Security risk: all assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores are reasonable and should not be changed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any risk, so scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated features.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious code or payload present                        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation  |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors        |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis supply chain security report correctly identifies the code as benign, with appropriate low scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No changes are necessary.",
