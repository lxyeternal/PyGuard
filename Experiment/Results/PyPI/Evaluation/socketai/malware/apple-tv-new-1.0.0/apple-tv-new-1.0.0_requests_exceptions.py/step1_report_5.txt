{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception classes are defined for internal error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations; the code primarily defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code follows standard patterns for defining custom exceptions and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module, then defines a hierarchy of exception classes for different request-related errors, with appropriate inheritance. The constructors handle initialization and preserve error messages. No external inputs, outputs, or data processing are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a library.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes and warnings for error handling in the Requests library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It is a standard, benign implementation with no security concerns.",
