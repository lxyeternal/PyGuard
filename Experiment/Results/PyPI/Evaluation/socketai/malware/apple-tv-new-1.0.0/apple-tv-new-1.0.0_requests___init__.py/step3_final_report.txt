  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment setup, and compatibility checks for the 'requests' library, including version assertions and SSL fallback configuration.",
  "sources": "Version variables imported from dependencies, environment detection code, SSL support checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network transmission, no external command execution.",
  "flows": "Version variables and environment checks are performed without data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Standard version assertions, environment modifications, and dependency warnings; no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine dependency validation, environment compatibility checks, and SSL fallback setup. It suppresses warnings appropriately and injects SSL support when needed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The version assertions and environment modifications are standard practices for ensuring compatibility and security. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with typical setup routines for a Python HTTP library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. It is solely for dependency validation and environment configuration. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are consistent with its functionality and security posture.",
