  "purpose": "To define metadata information for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author details, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment of constant string values to metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code consists of simple variable assignments with static string values. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static metadata information to variables representing package details. It includes no input handling, no external data sources, no sinks such as network or filesystem access, and no control flow constructs that could suggest malicious behavior. The comments are decorative ASCII art and do not influence code execution or security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no suspicious activity or potential vulnerabilities.",
