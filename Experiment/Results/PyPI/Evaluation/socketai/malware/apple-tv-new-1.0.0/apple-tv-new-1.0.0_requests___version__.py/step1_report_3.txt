  "purpose": "Declare package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments and comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art at the top; no suspicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily metadata declarations about the 'requests' library, including version, author, description, and license. The ASCII art appears to be decorative. No functions, network calls, or data handling code are present. No hardcoded secrets, user input, or external data sources are detected. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files. No suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
