  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and description.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for package metadata; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art comments, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The ASCII art is purely decorative. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
