  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and the consistency of scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward compatibility layer with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard imports, version checks, and type aliasing, all typical for such modules. No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of untrusted data flows or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code handles optional dependencies and compatibility without any malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a compatibility module with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. It’s standard import handling with no suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Compatibility setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with standard version checks and optional module imports.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical compatibility shim, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign compatibility utility.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no malicious behaviors.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward, transparent code.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**No adjustments needed.** The assessments and scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
