{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and imports various standard libraries needed for HTTP requests, encoding, and data handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (Python version), attempts to import optional modules (chardet, simplejson), and imports standard libraries and modules such as sys, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input leading to security vulnerabilities, as the code only performs imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "The flow is primarily from source inputs (system info, import attempts) to internal variable assignments and conditional imports; no untrusted data flows to critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code behavior, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to handle backward compatibility across Python versions by checking sys.version_info and importing modules accordingly. It also gracefully handles optional modules like chardet and simplejson. All imports are from standard libraries or widely used third-party packages. No untrusted inputs are processed, and there are no network or system command executions. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions solely to ensure the correct modules are available across different Python versions, with no evident security risks.",
