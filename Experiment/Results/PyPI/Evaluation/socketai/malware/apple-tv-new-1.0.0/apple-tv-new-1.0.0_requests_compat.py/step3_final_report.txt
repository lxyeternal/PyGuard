  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for handling import issues and version differences between Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for optional modules (chardet, simplejson), standard library modules (collections, urllib, io).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility that manages imports and version detection for Python 2 and 3. It conditionally imports modules like chardet and simplejson, with fallbacks, and defines type aliases for cross-version compatibility. There are no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The code structure is standard and transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
