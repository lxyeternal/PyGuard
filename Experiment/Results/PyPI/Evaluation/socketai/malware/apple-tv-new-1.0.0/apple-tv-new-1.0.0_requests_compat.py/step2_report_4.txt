  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a compatibility utility with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Evaluation:** The code is straightforward, with conditional imports and version checks. No suspicious or obfuscated logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, which aligns with the code. Security risk is 0, which is appropriate. Confidence is 1, justified given the clarity and simplicity.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import handling and compatibility logic.  \n- **Evaluation:** No signs of malicious activity, no untrusted data handling, and the code structure is typical for such modules.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0 are justified. Security risk is 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on compatibility and import management, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Evaluation:** The code is a typical compatibility shim, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0 are appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard compatibility handling, no untrusted data processing.  \n- **Evaluation:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0 are justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the benign, standard import fallback logic and version handling.  \n- **Evaluation:** No malicious or obfuscated behavior, no data leaks or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0 are correct.  \n- **Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious behavior—no code injection, no network activity, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common patterns for compatibility.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n- The code is a standard compatibility layer, with conditional imports and version checks.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, no network or file system manipulation beyond standard imports.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and structure, confirming it is a safe, benign utility module.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious intent.",
