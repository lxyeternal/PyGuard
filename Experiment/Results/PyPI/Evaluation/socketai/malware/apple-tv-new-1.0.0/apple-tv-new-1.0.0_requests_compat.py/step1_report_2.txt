{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities and imports for handling different Python versions and dependencies, mainly for request handling and data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily imports modules and assigns variables based on environment and version info.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves conditional imports and environment/version checks, with no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code performs standard compatibility and import handling without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script handles compatibility across Python versions, selectively imports modules, and assigns version flags. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic for module fallback and environment detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden code, or backdoors. The code is typical for a compatibility layer and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility and import utility module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for such utility scripts.",
