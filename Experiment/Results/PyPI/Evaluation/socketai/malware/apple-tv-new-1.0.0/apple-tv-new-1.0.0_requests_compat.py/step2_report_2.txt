  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a compatibility layer handling imports and version detection.\n- No untrusted data processing, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n- The import logic is standard, with fallbacks for optional modules.\n- No obfuscated, suspicious, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code's purpose is to ensure cross-version compatibility, not to perform any sensitive or risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a benign compatibility utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is standard for compatibility, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, the code is a straightforward compatibility shim.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is standard for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate; no security risks are present.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The assessments are accurate.",
