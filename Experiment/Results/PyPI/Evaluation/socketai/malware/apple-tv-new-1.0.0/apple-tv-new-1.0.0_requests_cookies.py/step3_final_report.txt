  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, and a cookie jar class for compatibility with requests and cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, request URL, response headers, and cookie data during extraction and creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage and headers; potential for untrusted cookie values but no malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Headers and cookie data flow from request/response objects into cookie jars and headers, with functions converting and managing cookie data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for cookie management, wrapping request and response objects for cookie extraction, creation, and management. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The functions handle untrusted data as part of normal cookie handling, with no code execution or network connections. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting typical cookie handling risks but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured cookie utility code with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate given its purpose and behavior. No further action needed.",
