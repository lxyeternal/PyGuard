{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities and cookie management functionalities for the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal utilities, standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and methods handling request and response objects, cookies, and cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Methods that handle cookie data (e.g., extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, remove_cookie_by_name, set, update, merge_cookies) that process and store cookie information, and network-related methods like extract_cookies_to_jar that process HTTP response headers.",
  "flows": "Input from request headers and response headers flows into cookie extraction and management functions; cookies are created or retrieved via create_cookie, morsel_to_cookie, and cookiejar_from_dict; cookies are stored and manipulated via RequestsCookieJar methods; cookie headers are generated for requests via get_cookie_header.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation present. The code relies on standard cookie handling and compatibility wrappers. No unusual data leakage or stealth activities are detected. The functions perform standard cookie management and are consistent with expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a set of utility classes and functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including mock request/response wrappers for cookie extraction, a cookie jar class with dict-like interface, and functions for cookie creation, extraction, and merging. The implementation uses standard Python libraries and patterns for cookie handling. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or stealth mechanisms are evident. All operations relate to standard HTTP cookie management, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module offers legitimate cookie management utilities intended to facilitate compatibility and cookie handling within the requests library. It does not contain any malicious code or behaviors, nor does it exhibit signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage. The code appears safe and aligned with standard practices.",
