  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the described flows, and the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions/classes for cookie management; standard libraries and request/response wrappers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, creation, and management, with flow from headers to cookie jars.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie utilities, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard, with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 aligns with this. The security risk is low (0.1). Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cookie handling utilities, with emphasis on potential injection points via cookie values.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation and modification, with potential for malicious cookie values.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity. The functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk remains low (0.1). Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie utilities, extraction, conversion, and management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie data flows into jars, headers, and request/response objects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no network connections.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0 fits. Security risk is minimal (0.2). Confidence is very high (0.95).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cookie management functions, with detailed flow descriptions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, and manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation, no network activity, no data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Security risk is low (0.2). Confidence high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling utilities, with focus on potential untrusted data input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, modification, header generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity, no malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Assessment:** Malware score 0 matches the analysis. Security risk is negligible (0). Confidence high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. Given the code's purpose (cookie management), this is consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied, but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Standard cookie management, low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, standard cookie utility code with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
