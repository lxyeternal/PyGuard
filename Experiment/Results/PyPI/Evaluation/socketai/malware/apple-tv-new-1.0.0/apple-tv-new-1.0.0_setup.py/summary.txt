  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a remote backdoor by downloading and executing scripts from an untrusted IP address. It employs techniques such as silent error handling, remote content execution, and privilege checks to evade detection and establish control over the host system. The scores in the reports are justified; the malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation level moderate (~0.4), and the security risk at 1 due to the high severity of remote code execution."
