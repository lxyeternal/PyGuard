{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform package setup for a Python project, but includes additional code for downloading and executing external files, and potentially malicious system modifications.",
  "sources": "Reads from os.environ, sys.argv, and executes code from __version__.py and README.md. Also reads remote URLs and receives data via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute shell commands, move and delete files, and run downloaded files. Also writes files locally and potentially executes malicious scripts.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file -> downloads remote files -> saves them locally -> moves/renames files -> executes downloaded files via cmd -> deletes temporary files. These flows can lead to execution of external code.",
  "anomalies": "Code at the end fetches remote files from IP addresses and executes them via subprocess, which is highly suspicious. The downloaded files are renamed and executed without verification, indicating potential malicious activity. The code bypasses normal package installation workflows, with an unusual inclusion of system commands and network activity outside typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The initial setup code seems standard for a Python package, but the presence of the final block is concerning. It downloads files from external IP addresses, writes them to disk, and executes them using subprocess. These actions could be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or perform system sabotage. The code's structure indicates an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent, with a focus on downloading and executing remote payloads. The code does not perform any validation or verification of the downloaded files, increasing risk. Overall, these activities strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines legitimate package setup with highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior involving remote code download and execution. The remote IP addresses and execution of downloaded files point to malware or a backdoor. It should be considered extremely dangerous and should not be used.",
