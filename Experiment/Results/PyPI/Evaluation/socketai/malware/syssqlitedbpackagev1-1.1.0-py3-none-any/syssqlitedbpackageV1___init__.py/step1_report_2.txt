{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to decrypt and execute a hidden payload, likely for malicious purposes such as code execution or system compromise.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, imports modules, and decrypts a base64-encoded string containing the payload.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted data is executed directly via exec(), which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code loads a hardcoded encrypted string, decrypts it with Fernet, then executes the decrypted string as Python code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted data, loading of a dependency ('fernet') installed at runtime, and decrypting and executing potentially malicious code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script installs the 'fernet' library, imports it, then decrypts a long base64-encoded payload with Fernet symmetric encryption. The decrypted payload is run directly using exec(), which allows for arbitrary code execution. This pattern indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads, as decrypting and executing code without validation is a common tactic in malware and sabotage scripts. The code's core behavior is suspicious due to its obfuscated nature, dynamic decryption, and runtime execution. While the use of third-party libraries is not inherently malicious, the context of decrypting and executing unknown code signifies malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, given its pattern of decrypting and executing a payload dynamically. It exhibits behaviors typical of malware or sabotage scripts aimed at executing arbitrary code without user awareness or validation.",
