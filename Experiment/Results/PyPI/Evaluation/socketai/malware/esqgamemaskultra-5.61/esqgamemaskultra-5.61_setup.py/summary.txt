  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The silent error handling and embedded URL support this suspicion. While the payload is not decoded here, the pattern aligns with malware delivery tactics. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; a slight increase in the overall security risk score to 0.85 is justified given the evidence."
