{
  "purpose": "Detects and sets up a Python package, but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup if 'tahg' does not exist, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; reading package metadata; import statements.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing an encoded PowerShell command; external URL connections within the decoded payload.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers execution of the obfuscated command; command potentially contacts suspicious URLs or performs malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed silently; obfuscated command with suspicious URLs ('esquelesquad.rip'); silent error handling masking failures; conditional execution based on filesystem state.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg' and, if absent, executes a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The command is obfuscated, likely decoding to a script that contacts suspicious external URLs ('esquelesquad.rip'), indicating potential remote code execution or backdoor activity. Silent exception handling further conceals failures. The package setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious supply chain behavior. Multiple reports consistently identify this pattern, assigning high malware (0.8-0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk scores (0.85-0.9). Given the evidence, the overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell payload executed during package setup, with suspicious URLs and hidden execution flags. The behavior suggests remote code execution or backdoor functionality, warranting immediate caution. The scores assigned are justified; I recommend treating this package as malicious and removing it from distribution channels.",
