      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell payload executed during package setup, with suspicious URLs and hidden execution flags. The behavior suggests remote code execution or backdoor functionality, warranting immediate caution. The scores assigned are justified; I recommend treating this package as malicious and removing it from distribution channels."
