  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package and a malicious payload downloader and executor",
  "sources": "requests.get() call fetching an executable from an external URL",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from external URL -> temporary file creation -> subprocess.call() executes the downloaded file",
  "anomalies": "Fetching an executable from an external source and executing it without validation; hardcoded URL; no input validation or checksums; suspicious use of subprocess to run a potentially malicious executable",
  "analysis": "The script initially defines package setup parameters but then proceeds to import requests, tempfile, and subprocess modules. It downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link, saves it to a temporary file, and executes it directly. The downloaded file is not verified or validated, and executing external binaries in this manner is a common malware tactic. The code contains no security checks or user prompts, indicating malicious intent or at least high risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation, which is indicative of malicious activity. The setup code appears to be a decoy or part of a malicious package payload.",
