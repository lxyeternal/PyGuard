{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package and then downloads and executes an external executable file from a Discord CDN link.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1055888135671795823/1105562608993570816/win32.exe) via requests.get() and writes it to a temporary file.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using subprocess.call([exe_path]), which runs the file as an external process.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the URL (source) through the requests.get() response into a temporary file (write), then from the temporary file (read) into the subprocess execution (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the silent download and execution of an external executable from a suspicious URL immediately after package setup code, without any validation or user consent. The executable is fetched from a Discord CDN, which is often associated with malicious payloads. The code does not validate or inspect the downloaded file before execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a typical setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies. Immediately following, it performs an HTTP GET request to a Discord CDN URL to download an executable file. The downloaded content is saved to a temporary file, which is then executed directly via subprocess.call(). There are no checks for the integrity, safety, or legitimacy of the executable. This behavior is highly suspicious, as it resembles a malicious payload delivery mechanism embedded within a seemingly legitimate setup script. The code acts as a supply chain attack vector, potentially installing malware on the host system without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior—downloading and executing an external executable from an untrusted source immediately after package setup. The external executable could perform any malicious activity, such as system compromise, data theft, or persistence. The code is designed to execute without user intervention, indicating malicious intent.",
