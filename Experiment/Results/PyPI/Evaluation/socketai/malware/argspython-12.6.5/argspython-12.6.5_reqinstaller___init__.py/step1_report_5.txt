{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable file, likely to run arbitrary code on the host system.",
  "sources": "HTTP request to fetch external content from a specified URL.",
  "targets": "Temporary file creation and execution via subprocess, which runs the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "Request response -> write to temporary file -> execute temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation, no checksum or signature verification, and no user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches an executable from a remote URL and executes it directly without any validation or sandboxing. This behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious code delivery, especially since the file is executed immediately after download. The use of 'subprocess.call' to run the downloaded file poses a significant security risk, as it can execute malicious payloads without inspection. No safeguards, such as signature verification or sandboxing, are present, which further increases suspicion of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes an external binary without validation, representing a high security risk and typical malicious behavior. It could be used to deploy malware or perform malicious actions on the host system.",
