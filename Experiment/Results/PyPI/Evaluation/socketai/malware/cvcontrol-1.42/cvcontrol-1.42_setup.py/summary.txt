  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, which is a red flag for malicious activity. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional logic justify high malware and risk scores. It warrants further decoding and analysis to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior."
