Its obfuscated nature and use of system manipulation functions confirm malicious behavior. Malware score is set to 1, and security risk is extremely high."

Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments to malware scores could reflect the cautious suspicion without overstating risk. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk, with no confirmed malicious activity."
