  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup. This pattern is indicative of malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package should be treated as compromised or malicious until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
