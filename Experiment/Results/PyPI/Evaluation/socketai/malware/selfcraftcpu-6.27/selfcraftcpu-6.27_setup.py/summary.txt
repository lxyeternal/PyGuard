  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior characterized by obfuscated, silent PowerShell payload execution during package setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and error suppression suggest malicious intent, warranting caution and further analysis. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until payload content is verified."
