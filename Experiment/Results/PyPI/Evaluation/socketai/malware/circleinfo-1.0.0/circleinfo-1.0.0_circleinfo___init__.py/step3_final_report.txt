  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalous patterns based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, files, stdin, network endpoints, and subprocess/system calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network communication, subprocess execution, system calls, and data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions into sinks such as network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and assign appropriate scores. Reports with no code or placeholder files are correctly scored zero across malware and obfuscation. The low security risk scores (~0.2) in reports with code reflect potential sink points but are conservative given the lack of malicious activity. Confidence levels are high, and the reasoning aligns with the observed code behavior. Minor overestimation of risk scores in some reports can be adjusted downward to zero, as no active threats are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and justified. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks is present. Scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code, with conservative risk assessments acknowledging potential sink points. Overall, the code appears safe, and no further action is necessary unless new evidence emerges.",
