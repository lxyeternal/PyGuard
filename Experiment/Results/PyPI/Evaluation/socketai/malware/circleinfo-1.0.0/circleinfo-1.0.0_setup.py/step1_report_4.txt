  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'circleinfo' Python module, providing metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; defining package metadata; setting up package info and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> package setup and configuration -> registration of console script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, keywords, classifiers, license, entry points, and Python version requirement. All parts are typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward configuration suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
