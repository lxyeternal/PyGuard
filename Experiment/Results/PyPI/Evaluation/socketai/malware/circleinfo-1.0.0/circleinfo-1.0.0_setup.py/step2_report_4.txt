  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are reported or observed.\n- The code reads a README.md for the long description, defines package metadata, and sets up a console script entry point.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or user input is evident in this snippet.\n- The reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with security risk also at 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  None. The code only performs package configuration.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The setup script does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate, as there are no security risks identified.\n\n### Any suggestions for score adjustments?\n- Given the consistent evidence, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
