  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration for 'circleinfo' package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; package metadata definitions; entry point declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, reading a README file, defining package metadata, classifiers, entry points, and Python version requirements. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. No issues or malicious behaviors are present or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
