  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'circleinfo' intended to provide information tools related to Bangladeshi mobile circles.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads environment variables only if used elsewhere (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "None evident in this snippet; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are apparent in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (besides metadata), or obfuscated code; standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description, configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line interface. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The package metadata appears benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is straightforward, typical for Python packages, and does not contain any malicious code or security risks based on this content.",
