{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'circleinfo' that provides tools related to Bangladeshi mobile circle information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package discovery via find_packages(); reading environment variables or user input if used elsewhere in the package (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of console scripts ('circleinfo') defined in entry_points, but no malicious behavior directly observed.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown in this code snippet; assuming the package's main function ('circleinfo') may process user input or external data when executed, but this is outside the scope of this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic present. The code is standard setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README for the long description, and defines package metadata including name, version, description, author info, classifiers, license, entry points, and Python version requirements. No input/output handling, no external data processing, no embedded code execution, or suspicious code snippets are present. The package appears to be a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
