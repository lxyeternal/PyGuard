  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and imports for a proxy-related Python package, primarily organizing and exposing classes and functions for proxy connections and errors.",
  "sources": "import statements importing modules and classes from local package files",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data processing or external communication functions are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up imports and exports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, constant definitions, and __all__ exports. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The module appears to serve as an interface for other parts of the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package related to proxy handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no external communication or data leakage activities.",
