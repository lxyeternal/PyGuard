  "purpose": "This source code defines module exports and imports for a proxy-related library, facilitating proxy connections and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; no data output or network activity is shown",
  "flows": "Imports are from internal modules; no external data flow or untrusted input handling is visible",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; version string appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports, importing components from other internal modules. It defines a version and lists exported symbols. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network communication in this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization script with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
