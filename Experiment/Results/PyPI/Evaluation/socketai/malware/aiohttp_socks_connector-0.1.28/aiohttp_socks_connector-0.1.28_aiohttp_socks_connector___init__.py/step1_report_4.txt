{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to a proxy connection library, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the assignment of version and export variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical security operations within this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves importing modules, setting version info, and defining the export interface, with no indication of data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All code appears straightforward and related to module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports components from local modules, sets version info, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The structure suggests a standard library module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization file for a proxy-related library, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports components from internal modules.",
