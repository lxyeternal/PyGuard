{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file for a SOCKS proxy library, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Static import statements; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with static imports and exports, containing no dynamic execution, network communication, or input handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is negligible. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. All evidence and reports support this conclusion, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
