{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export modules related to a SOCKS proxy connector, including error handling, connection helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are directly read; it primarily imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing, storage, or network communication is performed within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and exposes certain classes and functions; there are no data flow paths from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are observed. The version number is static, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module import and export setup, defining a package interface for a SOCKS proxy library. It imports classes and functions from internal modules and sets the module's version and export list. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger, legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface for a SOCKS proxy package. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
