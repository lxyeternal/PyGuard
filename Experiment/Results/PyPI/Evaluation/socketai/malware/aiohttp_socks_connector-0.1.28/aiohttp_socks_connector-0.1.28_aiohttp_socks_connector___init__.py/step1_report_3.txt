{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a SOCKS proxy client or server library, providing classes, errors, and helper functions for managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flows are visible within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The version string is a typical package version.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version declaration, and an __all__ list for public API exports. It does not include any data processing, network I/O, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup file.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module setup file for a Python SOCKS proxy library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It simply imports components and defines the public API.",
