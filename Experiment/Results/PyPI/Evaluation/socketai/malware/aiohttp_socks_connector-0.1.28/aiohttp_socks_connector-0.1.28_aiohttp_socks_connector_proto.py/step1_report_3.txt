{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, providing connection, negotiation, and address resolution functionalities for proxy communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user ID during class instantiation and method calls; it resolves hostnames via getaddrinfo; it receives data from proxy servers during negotiation and response handling.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from proxy server responses during negotiation, especially in the '_receive' methods. Data is sent to proxy servers via '_send' methods. The socket object can be used to send/receive arbitrary data if misused elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) -> network resolution and proxy communication -> receiving proxy responses (e.g., connection success, errors) -> potentially influencing subsequent connection logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious commands are present. The code uses standard socket operations and asyncio for asynchronous networking. The use of 'struct', 'socket', and 'asyncio' libraries aligns with typical proxy implementations. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection logic, including address resolution, authentication, and response parsing. It handles socket creation, connection, and data transmission with proper error handling. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, or hidden backdoors are observed. All data flows are within expected proxy communication protocols. There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual behaviors, or suspicious network activity. The logic is consistent with standard proxy client implementations. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with appropriate error handling and protocol compliance. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected network operations for proxy connections without any suspicious activities.",
