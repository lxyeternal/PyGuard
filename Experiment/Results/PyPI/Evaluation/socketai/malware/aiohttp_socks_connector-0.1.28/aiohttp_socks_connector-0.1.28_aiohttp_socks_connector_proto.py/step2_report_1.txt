  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's function as SOCKS proxy wrappers, with typical data flows and sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, standard async socket handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies legitimate proxy client code, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Handling:** Correctly notes the code manages SOCKS4/SOCKS5 connections, including authentication.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or backdoors; standard socket and asyncio usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the flow of data and address resolution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Uses standard protocols.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identifies the core functions and data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Handling:** Properly describes the code's role.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature as a proxy client implementation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified for network code handling untrusted data but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or activity detected.\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n**Risk:** 0.1 — low, given the code's purpose and absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code.
