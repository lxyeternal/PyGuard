{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials for authentication. These are provided via constructor parameters and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to remote proxies and over network sockets. Also, socket address resolution and string encoding/decoding occur, which could lead to data leakage if misused.",
  "flows": "Hostnames and credentials flow from initialization to socket connection and negotiation. Resolved addresses are used for connection setup and request formation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are observed. No dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are detected. The code adheres to standard asynchronous socket handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides socket wrapper classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, handling address resolution, protocol negotiation, and connection establishment. It uses standard Python libraries and practices, with error handling and clean separation of concerns. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of string encoding, socket operations, and address resolution appears typical and safe. No hardcoded credentials or obscure code constructs are present. The code’s structure indicates it is a utility for proxy connection management, not malware or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no malicious intent. It follows standard patterns for network communication and protocol negotiation, with no suspicious behaviors or security risks identified.",
