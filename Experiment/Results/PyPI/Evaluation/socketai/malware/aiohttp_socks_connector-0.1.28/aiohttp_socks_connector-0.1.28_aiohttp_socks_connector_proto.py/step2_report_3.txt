  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a SOCKS proxy client implementation supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable, given the code handles network operations and authentication.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The confidence (0.9) seems appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing proper handling, no suspicious code, and standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code again appears legitimate, with standard socket and asyncio usage.\n- The risk score is even lower, reflecting minimal concern.\n- Malware score remains justified at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The detailed reasoning confirms no malicious activity.\n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code’s nature.\n- The risk score is justified given the code's network capabilities, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard implementation, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code’s behavior. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable considering the code's network operations but no inherent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided code and analysis.\n- The overall assessment indicates this is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to network operations, but no significant vulnerabilities)\n\nThis aligns with the reports’ conclusions and the code’s nature.",
