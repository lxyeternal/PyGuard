{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing asynchronous connection, negotiation, and data transfer through proxies.",
  "sources": "Host, port, username, and password inputs; DNS resolution via getaddrinfo; socket data send and receive functions",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive functions, where untrusted data could influence network communication",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication steps; then socket connection and negotiation steps transmit data over the network",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or malicious code; no suspicious obfuscation or hidden backdoors; code appears to follow standard proxy protocol implementations",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection wrappers with asynchronous handling. It performs address resolution, socket connection, and protocol negotiation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. No data leakage, malicious command execution, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of standard socket and asyncio libraries indicates routine network operations. No anomalous or suspicious behaviors such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access are observed. The code's structure and functions align with typical proxy handling logic, with appropriate exception handling for network and protocol errors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates as expected for standard proxy communications. There are no indicators of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. Overall security risk is low.",
