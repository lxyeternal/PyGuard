{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for managing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections within an asyncio-based environment, including connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the destination host and port parameters, and user credentials (username, password). The code also reads from network sockets during negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations (sock_sendall, sock_recv, sock_connect) are the primary sinks where untrusted data (e.g., responses from the proxy server) can influence control flow or data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into connection and authentication procedures; responses from proxy servers (e.g., SOCKS reply codes) influence subsequent steps such as error handling or establishing the proxy tunnel.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to handle proxy negotiation and address resolution securely with standard methods; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code structures are present. Error handling is appropriate. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages SOCKS proxy connections with proper use of asyncio for asynchronous socket handling. It correctly performs address resolution, authentication (with optional username/password), and interprets server responses with validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or command injection, is evident. Usage of standard library modules and conventional patterns suggests legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy handling using asyncio, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages network operations securely and correctly, without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
