{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to establish proxy connections with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during socket connection, address resolution, and authentication procedures.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes untrusted data during socket communication, especially in connect and negotiate methods.",
  "flows": "Source data (host, port, credentials) flows through address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation to establish a proxy tunnel.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Standard socket and asyncio usage; no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It handles connection setup, authentication, and address resolution securely, with proper error handling. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation are present. The functions follow typical patterns for asynchronous socket communication, and no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates as expected for such a proxy client, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
