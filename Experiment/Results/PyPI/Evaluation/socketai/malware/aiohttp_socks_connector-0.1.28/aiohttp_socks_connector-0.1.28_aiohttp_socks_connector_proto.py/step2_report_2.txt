  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, handling negotiation, address resolution, and connection establishment. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes standard practices, proper error handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score seems reasonable given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct handling of SOCKS proxies, address resolution, and authentication. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The reviewer emphasizes standard socket operations, proper validation, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate; the malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS4/5 proxy implementation with correct handling, no backdoors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The review confirms standard protocol compliance and safe practices.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard implementation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the code appears routine.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, and malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Analysis:** The review confirms proper implementation and no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Validation:** The code snippets provided are consistent with standard SOCKS proxy client implementations. No signs of code manipulation, obfuscation, or malicious logic are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) reflect the inherent network handling risks but no significant security concerns are raised.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal inherent network handling risk, but no significant security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code is safe and legitimate. The assigned scores accurately reflect the analysis.",
