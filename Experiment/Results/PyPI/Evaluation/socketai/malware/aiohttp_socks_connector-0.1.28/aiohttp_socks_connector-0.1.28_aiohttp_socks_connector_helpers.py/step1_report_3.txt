{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxy servers, supporting proxy URL parsing and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "The code reads proxy URLs (parse_proxy_url), input parameters (host, port, socks_url, proxy_type, credentials), and socket connection attempts (sock.connect and asyncio.open_connection/loop.create_connection).",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include passing user-provided proxy URLs and connection parameters to network functions, and socket connection calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port) are parsed or received, then used to create proxy socket wrappers, which connect to proxies, and finally, connections are established via these proxies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Proxy URL parsing includes exception handling for invalid URLs but no malicious anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles proxy URL parsing with error checks, creates appropriate socket wrappers based on proxy type, and manages connections asynchronously. It validates input parameters such as host and port, and raises errors for invalid inputs. The code relies on external libraries for socket and proxy handling, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious operations. There are no hidden network communications, data leaks, or backdoors. All operations appear to be standard for establishing proxied network connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It handles input validation and uses standard libraries for networking, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code.",
