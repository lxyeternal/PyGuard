  "purpose": "Provides SOCKS proxy connection handling in asyncio, including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection functions.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, environment variables (via asyncio.get_event_loop())",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection",
  "flows": "Input parameters or proxy URL -> parse_proxy_url -> create_socket_wrapper -> connect -> return connection",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard validation and error handling; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio, with proper validation, error handling, and external library usage. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is straightforward, and the code relies on external libraries for socket wrappers. Minor robustness issue in port parsing exception handling (only catching TypeError) but does not impact security. No signs of malware, suspicious activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling untrusted input, which is typical for such utilities. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
