{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy URLs (parse_proxy_url), connection parameters (host, port, socks_url), and optional user credentials.",
  "sinks": "Creates socket connections, opens network connections via asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection, and connects to specified hosts and ports.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing and credential extraction flow into socket wrapper creation, which then flows into network connection functions, ultimately establishing socket or protocol connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of external libraries appears standard for asyncio and proxy handling. No obfuscated or malicious code found. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly manages proxy connection setup, including parsing URLs, handling credentials, and establishing connections asynchronously. No suspicious data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity evident. The code does not perform any unauthorized data collection or system manipulation. It relies on external libraries for proxy handling, which are commonly used and trusted. No anomalies or malware indicators detected. Overall, it appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with appropriate security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections in asyncio applications. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears safe and well-structured, with proper error handling and standard practices.",
