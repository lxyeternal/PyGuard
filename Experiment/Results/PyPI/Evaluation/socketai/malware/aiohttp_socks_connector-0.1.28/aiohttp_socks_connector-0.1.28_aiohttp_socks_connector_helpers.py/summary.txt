  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling untrusted input, which is typical for such utilities. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
