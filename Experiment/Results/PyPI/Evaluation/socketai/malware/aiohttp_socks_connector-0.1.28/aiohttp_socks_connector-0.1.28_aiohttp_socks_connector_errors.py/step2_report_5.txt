  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a set of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The code appears to be standard, clean, and intended for error handling within a larger proxy or network module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code contains only class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- **Malware, Obfuscation, Risks:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and overall security risk at 0.\n- **Logic or Reasoning Flaws:** None identified; the reports correctly state that these are simple exception classes.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \nGiven the simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, raising scores would be unwarranted. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or dynamic logic that could introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Any logical flaws or assumptions?\n- The reports assume the code is solely for exception handling, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the analysis is correct.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The assigned scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. All scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
