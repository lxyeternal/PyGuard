  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only establishes exception class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a series of class declarations inheriting from standard Python exception classes. It appears to define custom exceptions for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection-related errors. There is no logic, data handling, or external interaction present. The classes are standard and do not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The structure is simple and typical for error handling in network modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a network or proxy context. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module responsible for SOCKS proxy management or network error reporting.",
