  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that these are simple class definitions with no data processing or external interactions. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; the report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception class hierarchy, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward class declarations. The report accurately assesses that there's no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk and malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk and malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign, consisting solely of class definitions for error handling.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- **Scores:** All malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:** No questionable assumptions; all analyses are consistent with the code.\n- **Potential Risks:** Given the simplicity and lack of execution logic, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No malicious or security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If this code were part of a larger module, further review of the surrounding code would be necessary. But based solely on these class definitions, the security posture is sound.",
