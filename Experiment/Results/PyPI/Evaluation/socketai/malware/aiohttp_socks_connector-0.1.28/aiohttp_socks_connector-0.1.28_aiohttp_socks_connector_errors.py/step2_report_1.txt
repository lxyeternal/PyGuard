  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- They consistently note the absence of data processing, external interactions, or malicious behavior.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code provided matches the descriptions in all reports. There are no discrepancies; the classes are simple exception definitions with no logic, input, or output.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security concern that would warrant a higher risk score.\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any operational or malicious code.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on all information, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No malicious or suspicious elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
