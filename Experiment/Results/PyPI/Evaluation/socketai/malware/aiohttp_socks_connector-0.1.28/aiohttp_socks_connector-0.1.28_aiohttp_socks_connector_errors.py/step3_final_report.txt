  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely structural class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, data processing, or external interactions; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as error classes for a larger module. Given this, the overall security posture is negligible risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. No malicious or security concerns are evident. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
