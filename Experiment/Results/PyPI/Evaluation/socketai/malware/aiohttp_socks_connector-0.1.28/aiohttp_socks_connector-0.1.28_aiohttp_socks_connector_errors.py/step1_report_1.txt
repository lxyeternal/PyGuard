{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; solely class definitions for exception handling",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as these are static class declarations without execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functionality observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a set of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types. These classes are likely intended for use in a larger network or proxy handling module. There is no evidence of input processing, data leaks, malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, purely defining exception types, and contains no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
