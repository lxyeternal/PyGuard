  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class declarations and exception inheritance, no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "None, as this code only defines exception classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception classes, intended for structured error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no data inputs, network operations, or code execution logic present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The classes are straightforward and serve as error types, which is typical for robust exception management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is purely for error handling purposes.",
