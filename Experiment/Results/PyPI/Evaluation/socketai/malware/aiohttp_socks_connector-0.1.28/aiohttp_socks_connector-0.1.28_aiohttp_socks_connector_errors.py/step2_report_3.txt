  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No data processing, network operations, input/output handling, or dynamic logic is present.\n- The classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard exception classes, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence level of 1, and no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - Confirmed: The code is just class definitions for exceptions. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n   - No data leaks, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate reasoning.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n   - The consistent conclusion across reports aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - Malware: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: All assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - Security risk: All assign 0, consistent with the code's straightforward exception class definitions.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warranting higher scores are present.\n   - The code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate beyond what the code shows.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Personal estimate (after careful review):**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the existing assessments. However, considering the importance of exception handling in security contexts, I would still assign a **risk score of 0** because the code itself doesn't introduce vulnerabilities, but I would note that exception classes are often used in larger, potentially risky modules. Since this is just class definitions, the risk remains negligible.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior or code present                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward class definitions                  |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky operations detected           |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
