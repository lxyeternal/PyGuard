  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only exception class hierarchy definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, establishing a hierarchy for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The classes are straightforward and do not include dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or other malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling in a network proxy context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
