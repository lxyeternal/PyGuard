  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There is no evidence of input processing, data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and purely structural, serving as error classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscation scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no risk scores above 0.5 are justified.\n   - The code is purely for exception handling and does not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are consistently 0 across reports, which is correct.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on direct analysis of the code structure.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the issues.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThis code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for error handling in a SOCKS proxy module. It does not raise any security concerns.",
