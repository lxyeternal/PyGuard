  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in this code; class definitions do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output, no data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is purely class hierarchy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Exception class definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations, inheriting from base exception classes. There are no data inputs, external calls, or code execution. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The classes are straightforward, intended for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations, and do not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It shows no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is likely a component of a larger proxy handling library. Overall security risk is negligible.",
