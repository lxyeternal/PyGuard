  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. The low risk score of 0.2 reflects typical concerns with handling untrusted input in proxy configurations but does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The overall assessment is that the code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for use without concern for supply chain compromise."
