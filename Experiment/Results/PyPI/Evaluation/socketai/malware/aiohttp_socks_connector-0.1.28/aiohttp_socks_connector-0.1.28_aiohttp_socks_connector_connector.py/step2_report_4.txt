  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector with no evident malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for proxy handling, with no suspicious behaviors or payloads. The low risk score aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy handling, with a note on the custom NoResolver bypassing DNS.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that dynamic URL formation and socket creation are standard but could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, no malicious activity is present. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the dynamic construction of proxy URLs and socket creation, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's behavior is standard, and no malicious activity is detected. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights proxy URL parsing, socket wrapping, and connection management, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code appears legitimate, with no suspicious activity. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes standard proxy handling, with no malicious behavior or supply chain attack signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is standard, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, aligning with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to dynamic URL formation and socket creation, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, considering the code's functionality and the absence of malicious indicators.",
