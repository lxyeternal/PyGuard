  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, indicative of malicious activity. The setup() function is legitimate. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. The package should be treated as potentially malicious, and decoding the payload is advised for confirmation."
