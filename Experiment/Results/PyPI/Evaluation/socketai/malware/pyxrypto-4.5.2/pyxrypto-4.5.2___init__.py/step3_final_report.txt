  "purpose": "Simple demonstration function that prints 'installed' when called.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or environment variables; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted source to sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that prints a static message 'installed' and calls it immediately. It involves no external data, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and benign. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No adjustments or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
