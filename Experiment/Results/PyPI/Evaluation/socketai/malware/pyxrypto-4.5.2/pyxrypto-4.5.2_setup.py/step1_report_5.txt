{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'pyxrypto' and execute additional actions post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME') and downloads a file from a remote URL using requests.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') via os.system, which can run arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' -> execution of downloaded file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently catches all exceptions without logging or handling errors. It downloads and executes an external executable during post-installation without any verification. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' is suspicious and indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking. The use of 'os.system' to run an executable from the internet is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this info via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a potentially malicious domain and runs it silently. The 'PostInstallCommand' runs this 'send' function after installation. The package setup includes minimal metadata. The silent exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. Overall, this behavior resembles malicious activity such as data exfiltration and remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious intent: collecting system info, sending it to a suspicious server, downloading, and executing an external executable during package installation. The use of silent error handling and executable download/execution poses a significant security risk. This package exhibits high malicious behavior likelihood.",
