{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package called 'pyxrypto' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and the 'requests.get' calls to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' command that executes a downloaded executable file, and the HTTP requests that send data to an external server.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is retrieved, then used in a GET request to an external URL. Simultaneously, an external executable is downloaded and executed based on the platform detection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts an external URL with the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends data over the network, downloads an executable file, and executes it without user consent. Use of bare 'except' block suppresses errors. The URL 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com' are suspicious and could be malicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'send()' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends it to a suspicious URL. It also downloads an executable from another suspicious URL and executes it automatically if on Windows. The 'PostInstallCommand' runs 'send()' during package installation. The code's behavior of contacting external servers, transmitting environment data, and executing downloaded files indicates malicious intent. The use of broad exception handling hides errors, which is suspicious. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious. The code structure is straightforward but performs high-risk actions that could compromise user security.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information, downloading, and executing potentially malicious executables without user consent. These actions pose a significant security risk. The presence of suspicious external URLs and automatic execution of downloaded content confirm malicious intent.",
