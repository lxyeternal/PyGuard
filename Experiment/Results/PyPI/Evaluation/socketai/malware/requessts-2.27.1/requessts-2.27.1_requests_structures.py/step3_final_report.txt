  "purpose": "Provides data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup tables with case-insensitive keys.",
  "sources": "Initialization of 'data' in __init__, key access in __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__, and the __iter__ method.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the internal _store dictionary; key lookups and modifications access _store; no external sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is an iterator over values, not a proper copy of the object. This is a bug, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard data structures with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only notable flaw is in the copy() method of CaseInsensitiveDict, which does not return a new instance but an iterator over values. This bug does not introduce security risks but could cause functional issues. No external data transmission, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The minor bug in the copy() method is a non-security issue. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The code can be considered secure for supply chain purposes.",
