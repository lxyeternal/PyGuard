{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures (CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict) to manage HTTP headers and lookup tables, primarily for use within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data via the constructor, update methods, or dictionary item assignments.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval from internal dictionaries; no data sinks that send data externally or perform unsafe operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal ordered or standard dictionaries, then data is retrieved or manipulated within class methods; no external network or file operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code strictly implements standard dictionary-like behaviors with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which maintains case-insensitive keys for HTTP header-like data, and LookupDict, a simple dictionary with an optional name attribute. Both classes provide standard dictionary operations with no unsafe or malicious behavior. No external data transmission, command execution, or malicious code constructs are detected. The code uses standard Python collections and practices, with no obfuscated logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used within the requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this module.",
