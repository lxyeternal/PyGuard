  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup configurations, specifically case-insensitive dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data updates (update), and key accessors (__getitem__, get).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; data accessors return stored data or defaults.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization/update into internal storage, and from __getitem__/get into the returned value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated patterns, or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data structures: CaseInsensitiveDict for case-insensitive headers handling, and LookupDict for simple key-value storage. The classes use common Python collections and methods, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The classes handle data securely without executing or transmitting data externally. No code injections, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The implementation appears straightforward, focusing on data management, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility data structures for managing headers and lookup data. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
