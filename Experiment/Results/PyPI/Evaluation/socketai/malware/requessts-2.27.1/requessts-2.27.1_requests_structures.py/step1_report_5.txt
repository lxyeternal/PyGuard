  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup dictionary used in HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item access (__getitem__), update method, and other methods accessing or modifying internal data stores.",
  "sinks": "Methods that return or manipulate internal data structures, such as __getitem__, __iter__, lower_items, and copy.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the internal _store or __dict__, and then out through methods like __getitem__, lower_items, or copy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no file operations, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The classes are standard data structures without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard data structures for dictionary-like objects with specialized behavior. CaseInsensitiveDict manages keys case-insensitively but preserves original key casing for display; LookupDict is a simple wrapper around __dict__ with optional naming. There are no input/output operations, no code injection, or network activities. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data structures used in request handling, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used for request processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
