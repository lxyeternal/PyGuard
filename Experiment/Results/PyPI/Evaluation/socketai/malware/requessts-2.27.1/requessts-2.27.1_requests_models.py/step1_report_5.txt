{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions that support the creation, preparation, and handling of HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating HTTP communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from function parameters (e.g., url, headers, data, files, json, cookies), and internal method calls such as parse_url, get_auth_from_url, and stream_decode_response_unicode.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could reach network transmission points via prepared request bodies, headers, cookies, or the response content. Sinks include the raw stream for response data, headers for request and response, and the request body for transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., url, headers, data, json, cookies) into request and response preparation methods, eventually leading to network transmission in send operations (not shown). Response content is read, decoded, or parsed from the raw stream, and headers or body data may be accessed or decoded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries, well-known third-party modules, and common HTTP handling practices. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs are observed. The code properly separates input/output and does not perform any network connections or data exfiltration on its own.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard HTTP request/response handling with careful encoding, URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, and stream decoding. All functions utilize safe, documented library functions, with no evidence of malicious activity such as data leakage, system command execution, or unauthorized network connections. The code includes proper error handling, encoding support, and hooks for customization, aligned with normal library operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected in the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, well-structured component of the Requests library responsible for request preparation and response handling. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security threats. It performs expected HTTP operations without side effects or unauthorized actions.",
