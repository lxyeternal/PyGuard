{
  "purpose": "This code implements core components of the 'requests' library, including request preparation, response handling, and utility functions for HTTP communications.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as url, headers, data, json, files, cookies, and hooks; reads response content from raw response object; reads request and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Uses input data to generate HTTP request bodies, headers, and URLs; writes cookies and headers; reads response content; raises exceptions based on response status; encodes URL and body content.",
  "flows": "Input data (url, headers, data, json, files, cookies) -> prepare request/response objects -> encode and assemble request components -> send request -> receive response -> process response content and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are evident. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present. The code relies on external libraries for encoding, JSON parsing, and HTTP parsing, but these are standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions and utility functions for handling HTTP requests and responses, with clear and standard logic. It manages request preparation, including URL encoding, header validation, and multipart form data creation, as well as response parsing and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert network activity. The code appears to be a legitimate core component of a well-known library, with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate implementation of HTTP request and response handling typical of the 'requests' library. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Its functions are to facilitate safe HTTP communication within applications.",
