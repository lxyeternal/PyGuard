{
  "purpose": "The code implements core request and response handling for an HTTP client library, managing URL encoding, headers, cookies, hooks, and response parsing in a secure and standard manner.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters such as URL, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks.",
  "sinks": "Request body, headers, URL components, cookies, and response content where untrusted data could potentially be processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into encoding functions, URL construction, header setting, cookie management, and response parsing, with no signs of malicious code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code follows standard practices for request preparation and response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of an HTTP request/response system, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It handles URL encoding, JSON serialization, multipart form data, headers, cookies, and hooks securely. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The data flow is typical for such libraries, with no signs of sabotage or backdoors. The absence of suspicious patterns and the use of reputable modules support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard component of an HTTP client library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent and justified.",
