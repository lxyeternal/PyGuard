  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the consistency of their scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles request/response, URL encoding, headers, cookies, hooks, JSON, and multipart data. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states no malicious behavior, and the low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities. The confidence is high (0.9). The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on request/response construction, URL, headers, encoding, and standard handling. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the report is consistent. No malicious indicators, high confidence, and zero malware/obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on core components, encoding, error handling, and request/response processing. No malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the standard functionality. The confidence is high. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing request/response handling, URL encoding, headers, and response parsing. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low risk and malware scores are justified. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes standard request/response handling, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the others. No suspicious activity, high confidence, and low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** The provided code is a typical implementation of an HTTP client library, with functions for request preparation, response parsing, encoding, and error handling. It relies on standard libraries and external dependencies, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risk inherent in processing untrusted input, but nothing unusual.\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, indicating thorough analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, based on handling untrusted input, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and their scores accurately reflect the code's functionality. The code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP request/response library, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
