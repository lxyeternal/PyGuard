{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and manages imports for related modules and functions, particularly for HTTP requests, URL handling, JSON parsing, and cookies.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and optional third-party libraries such as chardet and simplejson, with fallbacks if they are not available.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or code execution. It mainly imports modules and sets up compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No direct data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code sets up environment and compatibility variables without executing external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The only noteworthy point is conditional imports based on availability and Python version, which is standard for compatibility libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles import compatibility for different Python versions (2 and 3), importing modules accordingly. It includes fallbacks for optional libraries like chardet and simplejson. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network connections, or operations on untrusted data. All imports are from standard or well-known third-party libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious logic. The code appears to be a typical compatibility module used in many open-source Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard compatibility shim for handling differences between Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware. The security risk is minimal.",
