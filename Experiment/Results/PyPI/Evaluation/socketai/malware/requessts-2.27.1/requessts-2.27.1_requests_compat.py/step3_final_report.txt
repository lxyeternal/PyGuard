{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility support for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, mainly through conditional imports and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like sys, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, StringIO, and collections, based on Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs import operations and variable definitions.",
  "flows": "Version detection leads to conditional imports; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; straightforward compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version, conditionally imports modules, and defines compatibility variables. It avoids dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing untrusted data. All imported modules are standard or well-known third-party libraries. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The purpose is solely to maintain cross-version compatibility, and the implementation aligns with common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
