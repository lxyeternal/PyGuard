  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard compatibility layer with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code performs typical imports and version checks without any malicious intent. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It describes a typical compatibility shim.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or suspicious logic; standard practice for cross-version support.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code handles imports based on Python version, with fallbacks for optional libraries.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard compatibility code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. It is a typical compatibility module.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, it manages compatibility with standard imports.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is purely for compatibility, with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the assigned scores. The code is a straightforward compatibility layer, common in many open-source projects, and shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.",
