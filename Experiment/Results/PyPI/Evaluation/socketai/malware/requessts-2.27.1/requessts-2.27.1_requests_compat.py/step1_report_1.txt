{
  "purpose": "This module manages import compatibility and shims for Python 2 and 3 for the requests.compat package.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, json/simplejson, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, collections, and collections.abc.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks; the code primarily imports modules and assigns variables based on Python version.",
  "flows": "Code reads system version info, attempts to import modules, and sets compatibility variables accordingly. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears standard for handling compatibility across Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a description and attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'. It then checks Python version to determine import paths and compatibility shims. It handles differences between Python 2 and 3 in standard library imports, defining compatibility variables and types. No hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious logic are present. The code's structure and purpose are clear and typical for a compatibility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for managing cross-version compatibility in the requests library.",
