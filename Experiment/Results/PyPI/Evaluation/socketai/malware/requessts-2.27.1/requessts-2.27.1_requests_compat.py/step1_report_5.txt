{
  "purpose": "The code handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 for a request handling module, ensuring proper imports and type definitions across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for external modules (chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json), standard library imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly or execute code based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Code reads Python version info to conditionally import modules and define types; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard compatibility imports and definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to import 'chardet' and falls back to 'charset_normalizer' if unavailable, which is a common pattern. It then detects Python version to load appropriate modules for URL handling, cookies, and JSON processing, and defines compatibility type aliases. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious logic. All imported modules and functionalities are standard for a compatibility layer in a Python HTTP request library. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is well-structured for cross-version compatibility, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3 with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical imports and type definitions necessary for HTTP request handling across different Python versions.",
