{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, providing consistent access to various libraries and functions across versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard library imports, including sys.version_info for version detection, and conditionally imports modules based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code mainly imports modules and assigns variables; it does not handle external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "The flow involves detecting Python version, importing appropriate modules, and defining compatibility variables and types, with no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard compatibility boilerplate, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The conditional imports are normal for cross-version support.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection and conditional imports to support compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It handles optional imports (like simplejson) and assigns common type variables for later use. All modules and variables are standard, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or misleading code features.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard compatibility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to ensure cross-version compatibility and does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
