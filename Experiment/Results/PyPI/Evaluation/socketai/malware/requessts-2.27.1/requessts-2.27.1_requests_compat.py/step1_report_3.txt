{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests library, ensuring cross-version compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via sys.version_info, imports standard and optional libraries, and checks for the presence of 'simplejson'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not process or output user input or external data directly.",
  "flows": "The code gathers environment info and sets compatibility variables without involving external untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed; the code performs standard compatibility imports and variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a module docstring explaining its purpose. It attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', which is benign. It checks Python version info and sets flags accordingly. It tries to import 'simplejson', falling back to 'json' if unavailable. Depending on Python version, it imports various modules and functions for URL handling, HTTP parsing, cookie management, string IO, and collections, ensuring compatibility across Python 2 and 3. All imports are standard, and variable assignments are typical for compatibility layers. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for the 'requests' library, with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages imports and environment detection for cross-version support.",
