  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a utility for cookie management, reading request data, headers, and cookie attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Headers are manipulated, cookies are extracted and stored.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Standard cookie handling routines.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report states the code is safe, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, security risk is very low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis appears accurate. The code is utility-focused, standard, and lacks any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions for cookie handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, storage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with a confidence of 0.9. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions/classes for cookies, similar to above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, extraction, manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The review aligns with the code's straightforward utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management utilities, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, storage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code remains a benign utility module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling utilities, similar to others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, creation, management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, perfect confidence (1.0), malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is purely utility functions for cookie management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but justified by the code's role as a utility library, not a security risk.\n\n**Additional Notes:** The code does not contain any network communication, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It is a standard implementation of cookie handling functions and classes.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, utility nature of the code, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
