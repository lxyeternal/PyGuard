  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including compatibility wrappers and cookie management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Code reads request headers, URL components, cookie attributes, and internal cookie data structures.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie extraction from responses, cookie manipulation functions, and cookie storage modifications.",
  "flows": "Request data (headers, URL) -> Cookie handling functions (e.g., get_cookie_header, extract_cookies_to_jar) -> Cookie storage update or retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Use of threading is standard; no indications of malicious obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages cookies, providing wrappers for cookie handling, extraction, and manipulation. It converts cookies between different formats, handles cookie storage, and produces headers for requests. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. Functions like extract_cookies_to_jar and get_cookie_header are standard for cookie management. The code includes compatibility layers and standard data handling routines without any suspicious logic. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Overall, this appears to be utility code aimed at safe cookie operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs expected cookie operations without malicious intent.",
