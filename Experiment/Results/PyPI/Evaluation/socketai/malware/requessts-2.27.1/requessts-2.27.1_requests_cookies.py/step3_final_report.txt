  "purpose": "Utility module providing cookie management classes and functions for handling cookies, extracting, creating, and manipulating cookie data within HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Request headers, request URL, cookie attributes (name, value, domain, path, etc.), response headers (msg object).",
  "sinks": "CookieJar storage, cookie extraction, header generation for requests, cookie deletion.",
  "flows": "Request data and headers are read to create mock request objects; cookies are extracted from response headers into CookieJar; cookies are retrieved and set via methods that manipulate internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard cookie handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling utilities, wrapping existing classes and functions for compatibility and convenience. It includes classes like RequestsCookieJar for cookie storage with dict-like interface, functions for extracting cookies from responses, creating cookies, and merging cookie jars. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code operates solely on data structures and headers, with no network communication or secret handling. The logic is straightforward, and the implementation aligns with typical cookie management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for cookie management with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
