  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities and classes for managing cookies within the requests library, including extraction, creation, and manipulation of cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Requests or external code passing request objects, response objects, or cookie data; functions reading request headers, response headers, or cookie attributes.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify or retrieve cookies, headers, or request/response data, including get_cookie_header(), extract_cookies_to_jar(), set_cookie(), and various cookie list functions.",
  "flows": "Input from request or response objects flows into cookie extraction or cookie header generation functions; cookies are created or modified via create_cookie(), morsel_to_cookie(), and set methods; cookies are retrieved or cleared through get, set, or remove functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard cookie handling patterns, with no obfuscated code or hidden logic. The functions are typical for cookie management. No unusual data leaks or privacy violations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for handling cookies, including converting request/response objects, extracting cookies, creating cookies, and managing cookie jars. The classes are standard and compatible with Python's cookie handling. No code appears to send data over the network autonomously, connect to suspicious domains, or perform malicious actions. The functions rely on well-known modules and do not include any obfuscated or malicious logic. The code is primarily utility functions and classes for cookie management, with no signs of malware or malicious data exfiltration. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured utility code for cookie management in the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No malware or malicious intent is evident based on the code provided.",
