  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for cookie management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, primarily wrapping existing cookie handling classes and functions. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) still reasonable given the nature of the code, which handles cookies but does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard cookie utility code, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Clear, standard cookie management code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—cookie management utilities, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard cookie handling utilities, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward implementation.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varying (0.1 or 0.2), but all within reasonable bounds for a utility library handling cookies.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (leaning towards the lower end, as the code is purely utility functions with no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-justified, and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action needed.",
