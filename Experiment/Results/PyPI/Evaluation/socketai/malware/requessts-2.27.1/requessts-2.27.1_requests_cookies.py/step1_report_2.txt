  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes to handle cookies in the requests library, including compatibility wrappers and cookie management features.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from HTTP response headers, request URL, and cookie parameters provided by client code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cookie storage, header manipulation, and cookie extraction, but these are intended for legitimate cookie handling.",
  "flows": "Input from headers or URL -> cookie creation/update -> storage in CookieJar -> retrieval for headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. Functions behave as documented, primarily standard cookie management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management, including creation, extraction, merging, and storage within a CookieJar. It includes compatibility wrappers for cookie handling across different environments. No signs of malicious activities such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or covert data leaks. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and focuses solely on cookie operations. It maintains standard security practices, with no evidence of intentionally harmful behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for cookie handling in the requests library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no covert functions. It serves its intended purpose of cookie management and compatibility support.",
