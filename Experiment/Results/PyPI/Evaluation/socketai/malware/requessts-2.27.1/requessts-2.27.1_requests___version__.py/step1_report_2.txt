  "purpose": "The code provides metadata information about the 'requests' Python package, including version, author, license, and description.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present; no processing or external data is handled.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or untrusted data handling in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata declarations with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard metadata module defining package information. No external data handling, user input, or dynamic code execution is present. The metadata appears normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of Unicode characters in __cake__ is harmless decorative data.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines package metadata for the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
