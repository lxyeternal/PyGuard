{
  "purpose": "Static package metadata definitions for the 'requests' library, including descriptive variables and decorative Unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and numeric literals to module-level variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode characters in __cake__ variable as decoration; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, input/output, external calls, or obfuscation are present. Unicode characters are purely decorative. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code's static and straightforward nature indicates a benign purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static metadata for the package. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
