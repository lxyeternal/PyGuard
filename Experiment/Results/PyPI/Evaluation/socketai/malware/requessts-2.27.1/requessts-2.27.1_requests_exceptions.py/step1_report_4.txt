{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, handling various network and request errors.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are directly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to files, network, or other sinks; no untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows, as this code only defines exception classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exception handling; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from external modules and defines custom exception classes for request-related errors. All classes inherit from built-in or external exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The structure is standard for a Python exception module, and no code performs I/O, network, or data manipulation beyond class definitions. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definitions module for the Requests library, with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears benign and solely for error handling purposes.",
