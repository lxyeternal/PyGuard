{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library, used for handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; class definitions with no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and inheritance; no untrusted data flows or data leaks occur within this code.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated during error handling; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for error handling, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and external modules. There are no dynamic behaviors, network operations, or data processing. The code is well-structured, typical for a Python error hierarchy, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. All imports are from reputable modules, and the class hierarchy is conventional. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is purely to define exception types, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
