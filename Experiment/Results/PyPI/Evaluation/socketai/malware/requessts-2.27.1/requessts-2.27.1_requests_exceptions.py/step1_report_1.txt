{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, a popular Python HTTP client.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (`urllib3.exceptions`, `.compat`) and defines class constructors and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard exceptions, extends them with custom classes, and documents their purpose. No network, input, or output operations occur here. No suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. All class definitions are straightforward, serving as error hierarchies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured code without any malicious intent.",
