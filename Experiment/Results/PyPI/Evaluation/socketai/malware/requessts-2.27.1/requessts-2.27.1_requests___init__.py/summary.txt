  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits explicit malicious behavior by downloading, extracting, and executing a cryptocurrency miner without user consent, and exfiltrates system info to external servers. It manipulates files covertly and uses obfuscated paths to hide its activities. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, with a moderate obfuscation score reflecting minimal but present concealment tactics. Overall, this code should be classified as malicious malware, posing severe security threats and warranting immediate removal and further investigation."
