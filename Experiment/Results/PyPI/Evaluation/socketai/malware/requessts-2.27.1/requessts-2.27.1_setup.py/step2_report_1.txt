  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard setup.py with minor concerns about exec() and os.system(). No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Security issues:** exec() on version file, os.system() for publish command.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware behavior detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — moderate due to exec() and os.system() usage.\n- **Comments:** The typo in package name ('requessts') is likely unintentional but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears typical for a setup script, with minor security concerns that are common in such scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on exec() and os.system() usage. No malicious code.\n- **Security issues:** exec() on version file, command execution via os.system().\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, standard setup script risks.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious behaviors beyond typical setup routines.\n\n**Assessment:** Standard setup script with minimal security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—exec() and os.system() usage, package name typo ('requessts').\n- **Security issues:** exec() and system calls, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No malicious behaviors, just some poor practices.\n\n**Assessment:** Typical setup script, minor issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, with exec() and os.system() usage, no malicious code.\n- **Security issues:** exec() on version file, system commands for publishing.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** Typos and standard practices.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware, just typical setup script concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—exec() and os.system() usage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security issues:** exec() and system commands, but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Comments:** No obfuscation or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0; no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and typical of setup scripts.\n- **Risk score:** While exec() and os.system() are used, these are common in setup scripts. The main concern is potential for malicious modification if the files or environment are compromised, but there's no direct evidence of such.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2–0.3** — minor security concerns due to exec() and os.system() usage, but nothing indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The typo in the package name ('requessts') is likely unintentional and not malicious but should be corrected for correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup.py script with typical practices. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The main risks are related to executing external code and commands, which are common in such scripts but should be managed carefully.\n\n**Recommendation:** No immediate threat detected; maintain best practices to avoid environment tampering.",
