  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package; calls 'where()' to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Output of 'where()' function to standard output.",
  "flows": "import certifi -> call where() -> print() to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code simply exposes the path to a trusted CA bundle.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' to obtain the path to the CA bundle and prints it when executed as a script. No untrusted data sources, external network connections, or data manipulation are present. It is a straightforward utility script intended to show the location of a CA bundle, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script designed to output the path to the default CA bundle from the 'certifi' package. There are no indicators of malware or malicious activity, and the code adheres to normal practices for such functionality.",
