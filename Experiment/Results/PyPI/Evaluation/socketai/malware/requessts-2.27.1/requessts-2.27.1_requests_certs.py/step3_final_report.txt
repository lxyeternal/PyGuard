  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via print() function.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> print(where()) when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output. It contains no input processing, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The purpose is benign: providing the path to the CA bundle used by requests. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a well-known package reduce risk. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the trusted CA bundle. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
