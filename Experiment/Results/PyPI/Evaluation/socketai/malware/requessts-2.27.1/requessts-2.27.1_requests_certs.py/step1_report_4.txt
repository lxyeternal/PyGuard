{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package and the print statement that calls it.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the certificate bundle path, which could be considered sensitive information if misused, but in this context, it is benign.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides the CA bundle path, which is then printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and serves a simple purpose without any obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a single function from the 'certifi' library and prints its result when executed directly. It provides the default CA bundle location. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external data inputs beyond the function call, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns. The code is minimal, clear, and intended for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and intended for retrieving and displaying the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a safe utility script.",
