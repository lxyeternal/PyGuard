  "purpose": "The code returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a well-known package function; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package to retrieve the path to the CA bundle. When executed as a script, it simply prints this path. The implementation is simple, standard, and does not involve untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues is present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility that outputs the location of the default CA certificate bundle from the 'certifi' package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
