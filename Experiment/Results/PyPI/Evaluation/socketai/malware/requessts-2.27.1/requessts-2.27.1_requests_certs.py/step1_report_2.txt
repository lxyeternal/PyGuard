  "purpose": "To return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function retrieves a trusted file path; the path is printed directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted function from a well-known package (certifi) that provides CA bundle location. It then prints this location when executed as a standalone script. No external input, no data manipulation, no suspicious behavior. The purpose is clearly documented, and the code performs a benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign utility script that outputs the location of the CA bundle from certifi. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks.",
