  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple script: importing `where` from `certifi` and printing the result.\n- The code is straightforward, with no input processing, no external network activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The purpose is benign: providing the path to the default CA bundle used by `requests`.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- It relies on a trusted, well-known package (`certifi`).\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The script's output is just a file path, which is generally safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code's purpose and behavior are benign, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign utility script with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.",
