{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and calls it when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The output (the path to the CA bundle) is printed to standard output; no other sinks or data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function's output flows directly to the print statement when the script is run as the main program.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code behaviors; the code simply wraps a standard library function for retrieving a CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known, trusted package (certifi) to get the default CA bundle path. When executed as a script, it prints this path. No input data is processed, and no untrusted data flows are present. The code performs a straightforward, safe operation with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. It is a minimal utility script with a clear and legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple utility to output the default CA certificate bundle path used by requests. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
