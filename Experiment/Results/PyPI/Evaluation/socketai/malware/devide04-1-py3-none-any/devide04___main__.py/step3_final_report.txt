{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, system information, and other sensitive data. It injects malicious scripts into Discord and Chromium-based apps, kills processes, disables security protections, exfiltrates data via a hardcoded webhook, and attempts self-hiding and persistence.",
  "sources": "User directories (Discord, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.), registry entries, local SQLite databases, environment variables, and system files.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a hardcoded Discord webhook, writes logs and credential files, injects scripts into Discord and Chromium apps, kills processes, modifies files to disable protections, and creates ZIP archives of stolen data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage, decrypted, and then transmitted over the network via webhook; malicious scripts are injected into app directories; processes are terminated; self-deletion and startup copying are performed for persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, code injection routines, process termination of security-related processes, self-hiding via file attribute modification, self-copying to startup, decryption of stored credentials, and self-deletion after execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive malicious activities including credential theft, cookies and password extraction, system info collection, code injection into Discord and Chromium apps, process termination, disabling of protections, data exfiltration via webhook, and self-hiding/self-deletion routines. The code is straightforward but contains some misleading variable names and minimal obfuscation, with some Unicode spaces and misleading identifiers. The behavior aligns with typical malware functionality aimed at system compromise, data theft, and persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware designed for credential theft, system sabotage, and data exfiltration. It exhibits multiple active malicious behaviors, including process killing, code injection, data collection, and exfiltration, with minimal obfuscation. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score of 1 is justified.",
