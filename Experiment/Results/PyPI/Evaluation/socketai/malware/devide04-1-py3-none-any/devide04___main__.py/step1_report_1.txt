{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies, then send this data along with system info and files to a specified webhook. It also attempts to inject code into Discord-related applications and can modify system startup and hide itself.",
  "sources": "Reads input or data from user directories (Discord, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Iridium, etc.), local system configuration files, and Windows registry via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a remote webhook via HTTP POST, writes sensitive info to files, executes processes (including injecting scripts into Discord), deletes or modifies files (like Chrome passwords, cookies, and system files), and zips and uploads files.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from directories and registry (sources) is decrypted and collected, then sent to remote server via HTTP POST (sink). File injections and process terminations modify Discord applications, while data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info flow from local system files/registry to network via the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, malicious intent to steal tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and Roblox cookies. It forcibly kills Discord processes, injects malicious code into Discord applications, modifies system startup, and hides itself. It also attempts to bypass Discord protections and modify Discord/BetterDiscord files. The self-deletion after operation and compression of stolen data further indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a credential stealer and information gatherer targeting Discord, Roblox, Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, collects Discord tokens and user info, and even modifies Discord and browser files to inject malicious code. It kills Discord processes to avoid detection and then reinjects code, which indicates an attempt to persist or manipulate Discord clients maliciously. It also collects system info, IP address, and geographic data, then exfiltrates everything to a Discord webhook. The code structure, including hardcoded URLs, malicious file modifications, and aggressive data collection, clearly points to malicious intent. The obfuscation is minimal but the nature of the operations and targets confirm this is a malicious payload aimed at theft, espionage, and disruption.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious malware designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information, inject malicious scripts into Discord, and exfiltrate all collected data to a remote server. It also modifies system startup, kills Discord processes, and attempts to hide itself. The purpose aligns with data theft, unauthorized access, and potential system compromise.",
