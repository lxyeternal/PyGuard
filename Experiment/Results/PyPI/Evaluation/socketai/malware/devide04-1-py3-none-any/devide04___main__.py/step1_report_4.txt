{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive data such as Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, passwords, and cookies from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this information along with system and network data to a specified webhook. It also includes functions to inject malicious scripts into Discord instances and manipulate system files for persistence or disruption.",
  "sources": "Reads input or data from browser leveldb and sqlite files (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.), local environment variables, Windows registry (Roblox cookies), system processes, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, writes sensitive data into local files, and potentially modifies or deletes system files (e.g., self-hide, startup copy, Discord process termination). Also injects scripts into Discord applications for further malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens/passwords/cookies from local files and system registry, decrypts sensitive data, collects system info and geolocation, then exfiltrates data via webhook and file uploads. Uses threading to perform tasks concurrently. Executes system commands for persistence and system manipulation, then packages data into a zip file before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Highly suspicious activities include decrypting browser passwords and cookies, harvesting Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and browser session data, injecting scripts into Discord, disabling system security mechanisms, killing Discord processes, and deleting files/self-hiding. Hardcoded webhook URL and injection URL suggest controlled external communication. The code also attempts to disable protections and modify Discord files, indicating sabotage intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a credential stealer, harvesting Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and stored passwords from browsers. It employs various techniques such as decryption of stored data, registry access, and reading local database files. It injects malicious JavaScript into Discord clients and disables or kills related processes. It gathers extensive system info, geolocation data, and captures files, then compresses and exfiltrates everything to an attacker-controlled webhook. Multiple steps involve system manipulation for persistence (self-copying to startup, hiding process). The code appears designed for malicious data theft, system disruption, and covert data exfiltration, with no legitimate or benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in nature, functioning as a credential and data stealer with capabilities to inject malicious scripts, disable security, and exfiltrate sensitive information. It exhibits typical traits of malware aimed at harvesting user data, disrupting system integrity, and maintaining persistence, confirming a high security risk.",
