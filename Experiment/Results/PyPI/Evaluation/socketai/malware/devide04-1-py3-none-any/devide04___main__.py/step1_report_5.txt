{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies from the user's system, and then send this data along with system info to a specified webhook. It also injects scripts into Discord client instances to potentially hijack or manipulate their behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads from browser storage files (leveldb, sqlite), environment variables, system registry via PowerShell, and files related to Discord, Chrome, and Firefox profiles; collects tokens, cookies, passwords, system info, and user data.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a remote webhook via HTTP POST, writes to files locally, and executes potentially malicious injected scripts into Discord instances.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser storage, registry, environment variables, and profile files provide sensitive data, which is processed, decrypted, and then exfiltrated by HTTP POST requests to the webhook. Also, the code injects scripts into Discord apps and terminates processes, then packages and sends data in ZIP files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, disables Discord protections, injects malicious scripts into Discord, and attempts to hide itself by setting file attributes and copying itself to startup folder. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, which are sensitive operations, and exfiltrates a comprehensive set of user data including system info and user tokens.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to perform multiple malicious activities: it extracts tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies from various locations; it attempts to disable Discord protections and injects scripts into Discord clients; it kills Discord processes; it exfiltrates system info, user tokens, and files via webhook; it hides itself from the user and copies itself to startup to persist. It uses cryptographic functions to decrypt stored credentials. It collects system info like IP, location, system RAM, disk space, and Windows product keys. The code employs threading and asynchronous operations to perform these tasks efficiently. Overall, all operations are aimed at stealthily harvesting sensitive data and system information for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates highly malicious intent, performing credential theft, data exfiltration, process termination, self-hiding, injection of potentially harmful scripts, and system info collection. It is clearly designed as malware to compromise user systems, steal personal data, and maintain persistence. Due to its extensive malicious capabilities, it should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
