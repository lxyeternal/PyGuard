{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, browser passwords and cookies, and system information, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook. It also injects scripts into Discord and other Chromium-based browsers for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading browser Local Storage and leveldb files, reading SQLite databases for saved passwords and cookies, environment variables for system paths, and web requests to fetch injection scripts and system info.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, writing decrypted credentials and cookies to local files, and creating ZIP archives for exfiltration. It also injects JavaScript into Discord's app files and terminates Discord processes.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data (tokens, cookies, passwords) are extracted from local storage, leveldb files, SQLite databases, and environment variables, then encrypted/decrypted as needed, written to local files, and uploaded to a webhook. The script also injects code into Discord browser processes and terminates Discord to facilitate injection.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses hardcoded webhook URLs, modifies Discord's internal files for code injection, terminates Discord processes, and collects system info without user consent. It employs obfuscated or misleading variable names (e.g., 'neatifyTokens'), and injects scripts into Discord installation paths, indicating malicious intent. Also, the code deletes certain files to disable protections, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential stealer targeting Discord, browsers, and Roblox, collecting tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info. It performs injection of malicious scripts into Discord, terminates processes to facilitate manipulation, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and ZIP archives. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, code injection into application files, and process-killing routines strongly suggest malicious behavior. The code's structure, including obfuscation tactics like misleading variable names and replacing spaces with Unicode characters in data, supports this conclusion. Overall, this is clearly malicious code designed for information theft and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, implementing credential theft, system info harvesting, process termination, code injection, and data exfiltration. Its purpose is to stealthily gather sensitive data and exfiltrate it to attackers, with mechanisms to disable protections and hide its activity. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
