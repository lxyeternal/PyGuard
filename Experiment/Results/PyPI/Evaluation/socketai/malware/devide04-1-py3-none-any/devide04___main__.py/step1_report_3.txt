  "purpose": "This code is designed to extract and steal various sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies from a Windows system, then compile and send this data to a specified Discord webhook. It also includes features to inject code into Discord, kill Discord processes, and hide itself.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local storage files, leveldb files, sqlite databases, and registry keys; also reads system information and user data.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST to a webhook; writes sensitive data to local files; deletes files and processes; injects code into Discord applications.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens, cookies, passwords, and system info from sources, then processes and formats the data, which is subsequently sent over the network to a webhook and stored locally in ZIP files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, code injection into Discord, process termination, self-hiding, startup persistence, and aggressive data collection without user consent. The use of decrypting Windows credential stores and registry keys indicates malicious intent. The obfuscation of certain strings and the presence of functions to disable security features further suggest malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious actions: it extracts Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and Roblox cookies by reading user files, registry, and encrypted data. It attempts to inject code into Discord, kill Discord-related processes, and hide its executable. It collects extensive system and network information, compiles it into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook. The code is structured to run silently, persist across reboots, and evade detection by hiding itself. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs, self-modification, and injection routines are typical malicious behaviors. No benign or legitimate functionality is evident; all actions aim to compromise user privacy and security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious stealer and injector targeting Windows users. It exfiltrates sensitive credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info, injects malicious scripts into Discord, and attempts to hide its activity. Its primary purpose is to compromise user accounts and steal personal data, indicating high malicious intent with multiple suspicious behaviors.",
