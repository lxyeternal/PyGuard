  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple function `hello()` that prints a static message.\n   - There are no external inputs, data flows, or external dependencies involved.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No reports identify any malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The code does not perform any file or system modifications.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies are noted.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**:\n   - All reports agree on the absence of obfuscation or anomalies.\n   - The code is transparent and minimal.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, indicating no security concerns.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the clear code.\n\n5. **Score Justification and Consistency**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity, the scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n6. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their benign evaluation.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- Since the code is a minimal, benign demonstration, there's no need to adjust the scores.\n- The external URL reference does not impact security; it's merely documentation.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Keep scores as they are:\n  - Malware: 0.0\n  - Obfuscated: 0.0\n  - Security Risk: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
