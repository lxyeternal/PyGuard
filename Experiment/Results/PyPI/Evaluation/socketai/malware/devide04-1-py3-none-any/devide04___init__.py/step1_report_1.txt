  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function to print a greeting message, intended as a test of the module.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used or read in the code.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data or external systems are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply prints a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single function that prints a static string. It references an external URL for documentation but does not invoke or import any external modules, nor does it perform any network, file, or system operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a benign demonstration or placeholder function.",
  "conclusion": "This is a harmless, non-malicious example code intended to demonstrate module operation. There are no security risks or malware indicators present.",
