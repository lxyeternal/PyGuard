{
  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function that prints a static message, intended for testing or illustrative purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or dependencies; the code is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network activity, or data leaks; the code only outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the function executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'hello()' that prints a fixed message. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or access sensitive data. The code is clear, simple, and intended for demonstration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward demonstration function with no malicious intent or security concerns. All evidence points to a safe, non-malicious snippet suitable for testing or documentation purposes.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
