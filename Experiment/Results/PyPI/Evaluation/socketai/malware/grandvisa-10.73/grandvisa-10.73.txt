      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded, obfuscated PowerShell intended to run silently, which is characteristic of malware. The setup script itself appears legitimate but is compromised by malicious payload execution. The high suspicion and scores are justified based on obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional behavior. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious activity."
