  "flows": "os.name check -> Fernet decryption -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run decrypted code, embedded encrypted string, code executed only on Windows platform",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup with metadata. The custom install class 'GruppeInstall' overrides the run() method. If the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is executed directly via exec(). This is highly suspicious, as executing decrypted code at install time can hide malicious activities such as system modifications, data exfiltration, or backdoor setup. The use of encrypted strings and runtime code execution is indicative of obfuscation. The package's main setup parameters are typical, but the conditional malicious code on Windows raises a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows systems. This could be used to run malicious scripts covertly, constituting a security threat. The use of exec() on decrypted payload is a strong indicator of malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
