  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'biip-utils' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.name), imported modules (requests, fernet), hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec() if os.name is 'nt'.",
  "flows": "On Windows systems, the code imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload in the code, exec() on decrypted content, conditional execution only on Windows, potential for malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install command class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the run() method. If the target system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code using exec(). This behavior is suspicious because it involves executing dynamically decrypted code at install time, which can be malicious. The hardcoded key and encrypted payload suggest an intent to conceal the malicious code. No other malicious activities or suspicious behaviors are evident elsewhere in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high risk of malicious behavior due to the use of hardcoded decryption keys, encrypted payload, and runtime execution of arbitrary code via exec() on Windows systems. This indicates potential malware activity designed to run malicious code during package installation.",
