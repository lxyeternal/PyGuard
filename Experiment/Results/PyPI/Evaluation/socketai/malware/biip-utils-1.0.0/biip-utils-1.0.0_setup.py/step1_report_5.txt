  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'biip-utils' package, including custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted data, package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code if decryption results in malicious payload.",
  "flows": "Detection of environment (os.name), import of modules, decryption of embedded data via Fernet, execution of decrypted payload via exec() during install.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decrypted code, hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, conditional code execution based on OS, obfuscation via meaningless strings in description and long description.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload via exec(). The payload is stored as an encrypted string with a hardcoded Fernet key, making it potentially malicious. The setup process includes standard parameters but the execution of decrypted code during installation indicates malicious intent or backdoor capability. The presence of obfuscated description strings and the use of exec() with decrypted data are suspicious. The code does not perform any benign or transparent operations beyond package setup, and the embedded payload could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior, executing decrypted code during installation, which could be used for backdoors or other malicious activities. The hardcoded encrypted payload and use of exec() are typical indicators of malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
