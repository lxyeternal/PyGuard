  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input/output, environment variables, network or file I/O, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through code execution paths, including dynamic code execution and data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic execution, misleading variable names, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity such as network exfiltration, destructive commands, or data theft. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are identified. The code structure appears standard for utility or setup scripts, with benign data handling. The low malware score (0.1) reflects the obfuscation concern without evidence of malicious payloads. The high confidence (0.9) indicates certainty about benign nature in non-obfuscated code. The obfuscation score (0.7) aligns with the signs of code hiding. The security risk score (0.2) is justified given the lack of active malicious behavior, though obfuscation warrants some caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign with obfuscation present but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security risk remains low. Slightly lowering the malware score in obfuscated cases can improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable.",
