{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious information stealer and remote access tool (RAT) designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and potentially cryptocurrency wallets, then send this data to a remote server or webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), user data directories (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex, Brave profiles), clipboard contents, and running processes. It also reads local system information via subprocess calls and Windows Registry queries.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to the specified Discord webhook URL, uploaded to external file hosting services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), and exfiltrated through network requests made by functions like 'LoadUrlib' and 'LoadRequests'. The data includes browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, screenshots, and files matching specific keywords, indicating exfiltration to remote servers.",
  "flows": "The code captures user tokens, passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, system info, and screenshots from user browsers and system, then formats this information and transmits it to the configured webhook. It also zips collected files, uploads them to external services, and reports system details and geolocation data. It uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently, then consolidates and sends the information.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include the use of obfuscated/deceptive function and variable names, extensive use of threading for concurrent operations, and aggressive data collection from multiple browsers, platforms, and applications. Hardcoded URLs, Discord webhook, and specific file paths are suspicious. The code also kills specific processes related to debugging or analysis, deletes files, modifies browser data (e.g., bypassing protections, tampering with local state files), and performs obfuscation-like patterns. The code also collects system identifiers and performs conditional exit strategies based on environment detection (e.g., VM, sandbox, specific usernames, PC names, IP addresses). Additionally, the code incorporates code for zip file creation, external uploads, and the collection of various personal data types, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed for malicious purposes, collecting a wide array of user data, including browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and screenshots. It employs techniques to evade detection (threading, process termination, environment checks). It exfiltrates data via HTTP POST requests and uploads to third-party services. The code modifies browser local storage and registry data to disable security measures. It performs extensive information gathering, disguises its operations, and actively kills security or analysis processes. The presence of hardcoded URLs, suspicious process names, and obfuscated patterns suggests malicious sabotage. The code's purpose aligns with malware that compromises user privacy, steals credentials, and enables remote control or further exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to steal sensitive user data, disable security measures, and exfiltrate information to remote servers. It demonstrates clear intent for malicious surveillance, credential theft, and potential system sabotage. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware suspicion score is also very high, indicating this package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
