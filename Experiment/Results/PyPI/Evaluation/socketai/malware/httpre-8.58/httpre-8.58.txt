      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthily run PowerShell command during setup. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified. Overall, this package poses a significant security risk and should be treated as potentially malicious until further payload analysis confirms safety."
