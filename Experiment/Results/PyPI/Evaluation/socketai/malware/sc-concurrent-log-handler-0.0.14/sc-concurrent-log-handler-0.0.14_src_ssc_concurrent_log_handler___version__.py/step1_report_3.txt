  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'sc-concurrent-log-handler' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to module-level variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data reads present; no data leaks or external communications are initiated.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. All variables contain static, hardcoded string values. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata assignment, establishing package information such as title, description, author, license, and version. There are no data input/output operations, no external communications, no code execution, and no potentially malicious logic. The email address appears to be a personal or organizational contact. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are present. This is standard package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely serving as metadata definition for the package. No malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
