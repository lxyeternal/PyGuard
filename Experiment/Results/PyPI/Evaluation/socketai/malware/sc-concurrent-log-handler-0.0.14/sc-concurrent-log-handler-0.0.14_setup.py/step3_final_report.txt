{
  "purpose": "The code's purpose is to set up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including executing a remote script during installation.",
  "sources": "The remote shell command embedded in the CustomInstall.run() method, encoded in base64, executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded shell command which downloads and runs a script from an external URL during setup.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded and passed to os.system, which executes the remote wget command piped into bash.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for the shell command, executing remote code during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a CustomInstall class that, during installation, encodes a shell command to download and execute a remote script from 'https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh'. This command is decoded from base64 and executed via os.system, leading to remote code execution at install time. The rest of the setup script appears standard, with no other malicious behavior. The remote URL and execution pattern are indicative of malicious intent, such as a supply chain attack or backdoor. The use of base64 adds a mild layer of obfuscation but is common in malicious scripts. The behavior is highly dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which can compromise user systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively executes remote code during installation, representing a severe security risk and malicious behavior. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or malware deployment. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 due to the remote code execution, and obfuscation is moderate. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
