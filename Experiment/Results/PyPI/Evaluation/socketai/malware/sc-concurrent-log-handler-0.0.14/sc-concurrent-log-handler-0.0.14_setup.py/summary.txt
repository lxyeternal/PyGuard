  "conclusion": "The code actively executes remote code during installation, representing a severe security risk and malicious behavior. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or malware deployment. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 due to the remote code execution, and obfuscation is moderate. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and avoided."
