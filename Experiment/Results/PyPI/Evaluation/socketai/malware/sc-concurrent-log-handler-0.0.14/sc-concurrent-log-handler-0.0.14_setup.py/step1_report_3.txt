{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package for distribution, including dependencies, metadata, and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads package version info from __version__.py, reads README.md for long description, platform detection via sys.platform, and executes a base64-decoded shell command during installation.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes a command decoded from a base64 string, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded shell command is generated, then decoded and executed via os.system, potentially executing remote or malicious scripts.",
  "anomalies": "The script encodes a remote download-and-execute command ('wget ... | bash') into base64 and executes it directly during installation, which is highly suspicious and atypical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations, including reading files, setting dependencies, and defining package metadata. The unusual part is the CustomInstall class, which encodes a shell command to download and run an external script from a remote URL. This command is decoded from base64 at runtime and executed via os.system(), which can execute arbitrary code. This behavior introduces a significant security risk, as it fetches and executes code from an external source without any validation or user consent. No other parts of the code show malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The remote command execution during install is highly suspicious and suggests potential malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior in the CustomInstall class, which executes a remote shell script during package installation. This is a serious security concern, indicating the package could be used for malicious purposes or supply chain attacks.",
