  "purpose": "Setup script for installing a Python logging library with concurrency, gzip, and Windows support.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, version info from __version__.py, detecting platform, importing modules, executing base64-encoded shell command.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded base64 string, potentially running remote script.",
  "flows": "Reading version info -> executing os.system with base64-decoded command.",
  "anomalies": "The script encodes a shell command ('wget ... | bash') into base64 and then decodes and executes it via os.system(). This is unusual and suspicious in a setup script, as it may execute remote code without verification.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs setup tasks for a Python package, including reading metadata, handling dependencies, and platform-specific imports. The key anomaly is the CustomInstall class, which overrides the run() method to execute a base64-encoded shell command that downloads and executes a script from an external URL. This behavior is not standard for a setup script and indicates potential malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. All other parts of the code are typical for package configuration. The use of os.system() with a dynamically constructed command from a base64 string is a high-risk behavior, strongly suggestive of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: executing a remote script during package installation. This is highly suspicious and indicates a likely malicious intent, such as deploying malware or establishing backdoors. The rest of the script is standard setup code, but the embedded remote execution makes the overall package dangerous.",
