      "conclusion": "The code actively executes remote code during installation, representing a severe security risk and malicious behavior. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or malware deployment. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 due to the remote code execution, and obfuscation is moderate. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and avoided."

The minor regex typo should be corrected for proper operation, but it does not impact security. The environment variable usage is standard practice, and no suspicious activity is evident."
