  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to the execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command conditioned on a directory check. The presence of suspicious comments and obfuscation tactics strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be treated as compromised or malicious, and further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation."
