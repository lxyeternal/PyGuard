  "purpose": "The code gathers system and user information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specific URL.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL",
  "flows": "User input and system information (source) is collected and sent directly via requests.post() (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits potentially identifiable system information without user consent or clear purpose; no validation or anonymization is present. The target URL is suspicious and not a recognized package repository.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for HTTP requests, user info, and system info. It sets package info variables but does not use them elsewhere. It then immediately posts a JSON payload containing the package name, version, username, current directory, and hostname to an external URL. There is no validation, encryption, or user confirmation. The URL 'https://0v0.in/pypi/' is suspicious and not related to standard PyPI infrastructure. The data transmission could be used for fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits system information to an external, suspicious URL without user consent, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. It demonstrates malicious intent related to data exfiltration.",
