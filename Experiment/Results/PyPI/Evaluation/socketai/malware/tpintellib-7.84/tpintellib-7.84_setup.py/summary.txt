  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains high-confidence malicious signals, including obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, silent error handling, and suspicious URL comments. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as backdoor installation or payload delivery. The scores assigned are justified and indicate a significant security threat, warranting the package's rejection or thorough review before use."
