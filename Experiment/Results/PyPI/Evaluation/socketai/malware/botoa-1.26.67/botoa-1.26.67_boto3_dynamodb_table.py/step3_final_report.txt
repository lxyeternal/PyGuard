  "purpose": "Provides batch writing capabilities for DynamoDB with deduplication and automatic batching.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'Item' and 'Key' used to build batch requests.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'batch_write_item' API with prepared request items.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> internal request buffer -> batch_write_item API call.",
  "anomalies": "None; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for batch writing to DynamoDB, including request deduplication based on primary keys. It manages internal buffering, automatic flushing when buffer reaches a threshold, and retries unprocessed items. No suspicious patterns, external network calls beyond AWS SDK, or obfuscation are present. The logic is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with a benign utility handling untrusted data in a controlled manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard DynamoDB batch utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action required.",
