{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file operations, warning filtering, and deprecation notices, primarily for AWS SDK compatibility and runtime management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, os, errno, socket, warnings), reads sys.version_info, and checks sys.platform. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.remove and os.rename for file operations, warnings.filterwarnings, and warnings.warn. These are standard functions for handling files and warnings with no malicious intent.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified. The code manipulates files locally, filters warnings, and issues deprecation notices based on environment and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code uses standard Python library functions for environment checks and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility module for managing deprecation warnings and file renaming across platforms. It includes safe file removal with error handling, conditional platform-specific file renaming, and deprecation warnings for outdated Python versions. All operations are standard and do not perform any malicious activities. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears legitimate, aimed at maintaining compatibility and informing users about deprecated Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module focused on environment management, deprecation warnings, and file operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
