  "sources": "os.remove, os.rename, sys.platform, sys.version_info, warnings.filterwarnings, warnings.warn",
  "sinks": "File system operations (remove, rename), warning messages",
  "flows": "Platform detection -> file removal/renaming, warning filtering -> deprecation warnings",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward utility code with no suspicious or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform-specific file renaming, filters deprecation warnings, and issues deprecation notices based on Python version. No external data input, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. Error handling for file removal is correct, and warning filters are standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured, with clear intent and safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for environment compatibility and deprecation management, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its functionality.",
