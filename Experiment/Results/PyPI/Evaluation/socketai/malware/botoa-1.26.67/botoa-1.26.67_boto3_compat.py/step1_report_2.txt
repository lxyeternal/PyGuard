  "purpose": "This code provides platform-specific file renaming, warning filtering, and deprecation warning functionalities for AWS SDK support, primarily related to boto3 compatibility.",
  "sources": "User input or system state: sys.platform, sys.version_info, environment variables (indirectly through warnings and sys modules), file system (os.remove, os.rename).",
  "sinks": "File system operations (os.remove, os.rename), warnings (warnings.filterwarnings, warnings.warn).",
  "flows": "System platform check influences rename_file behavior; deprecation warning filters and warnings triggered based on Python version and module states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code predominantly manages warnings and file operations, which are standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script manages platform-specific file renaming with error handling, filters deprecation warnings related to boto3, and issues deprecation warnings based on Python version. These operations are benign and typical for maintaining compatibility and informing users of upcoming deprecations. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of warnings and error handling appears standard, and no secret or sensitive information is processed or stored. Overall, the code is straightforward with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling warnings, deprecation notices, and platform-specific file operations related to AWS SDK support. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and appears intended for maintaining compatibility and informing users about deprecation timelines.",
