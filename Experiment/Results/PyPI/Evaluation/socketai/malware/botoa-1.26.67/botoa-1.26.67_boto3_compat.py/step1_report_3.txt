{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for file renaming, warning filtering, and deprecation notices related to the boto3 library and Python versions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from system modules (sys, os), socket errors, and warning filters; deprecated Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (os.remove, os.rename), warnings.warn, and filtering warnings could potentially be misused if exploited to mask malicious activities.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.platform and sys.version_info influences behavior; warnings filter and rename_file functions perform filesystem modifications; warnings.warn communicates deprecation info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; code appears standard and intended for environment compatibility and deprecation handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard utility code with platform-specific file renaming, warning filtering, and deprecation messaging. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are present. It relies on standard library modules and publicly documented practices. The warning filtering and deprecation messages are typical for library maintenance. There are no indications of obfuscated, malicious, or harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for environment handling and deprecation warnings in the boto3 library context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The overall security risk is very low.",
