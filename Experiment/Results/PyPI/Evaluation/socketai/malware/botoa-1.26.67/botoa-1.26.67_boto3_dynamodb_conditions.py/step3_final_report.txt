  "purpose": "A DynamoDB expression builder that constructs safe query expressions using placeholders, regex parsing, and class hierarchies for conditions and attributes.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, regex pattern matching for attribute names, method calls generating condition objects, attribute value inputs.",
  "sinks": "Generation of expression strings with placeholders; placeholders stored in dictionaries for attribute names and values.",
  "flows": "Input attribute objects and condition values → Placeholder generation and substitution → Final expression string with placeholders and corresponding dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Regex usage is standard; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured DynamoDB expression builder that employs safe placeholder substitution, regex for attribute parsing, and class hierarchies for conditions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The placeholder mechanisms and expression formatting follow best practices, ensuring safe query construction. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk around 0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation. The code's design minimizes security risks, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure DynamoDB expression builder with no malicious or obfuscated components. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safety and purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
