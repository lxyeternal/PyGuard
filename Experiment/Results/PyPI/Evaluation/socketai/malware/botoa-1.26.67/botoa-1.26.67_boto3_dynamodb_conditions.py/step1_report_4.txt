{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for constructing DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholders, used to build safe query conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes attribute names and values passed to condition objects and methods (e.g., __init__, eq, lt, between, contains). These are used as parameters for condition objects and are processed during expression building.",
  "sinks": "The placeholders for attribute names and values are generated and stored in dictionaries. These are used in DynamoDB query expressions to prevent injection. The code itself does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input data (attribute names and values) flow into condition objects, which are then processed by the ExpressionBuilder to produce expression strings with placeholders. These placeholders are stored in dictionaries for safe DynamoDB query execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly constructs expression strings and placeholders for DynamoDB queries. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is structurally straightforward and typical for query expression building.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes to build DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholder substitution, preventing injection attacks. It includes regex parsing of attribute names, placeholder generation for names and values, and recursive expression construction. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The logic is consistent with safe expression building. The absence of any network code, system modifications, or hidden behaviors indicates no malware. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for secure DynamoDB query construction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for building DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholders. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be legitimate, open-source query builder code for DynamoDB with no evident security issues or malware.",
