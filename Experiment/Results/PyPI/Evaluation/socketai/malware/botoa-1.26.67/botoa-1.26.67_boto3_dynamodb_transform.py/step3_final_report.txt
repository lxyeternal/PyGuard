{
  "purpose": "The code extends boto3 DynamoDB client with event handlers for copying parameters, transforming condition expressions, serializing/deserializing data, and updating documentation. It includes a custom dictionary class for copying behavior.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for DynamoDB operations, event registration points, data transformation functions, and documentation update hooks.",
  "sinks": "Transformation functions that modify parameters and responses, but no external data sinks or malicious data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through event handlers where it is transformed, serialized, or deserialized; the custom _ForgetfulDict influences copying behavior during deep copy operations.",
  "anomalies": "The _ForgetfulDict class overrides __setitem__ to discard all assigned items, which is unconventional but documented and used intentionally for copying semantics.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK extension for DynamoDB, registering event handlers for parameter copying, condition expression building, and data serialization. The only unusual element is _ForgetfulDict, which discards items when set, serving as a memo during deepcopy to prevent shared references. No code injection, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is known and documented, not malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the purpose of _ForgetfulDict.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate SDK extension code with an unusual but benign _ForgetfulDict class used for copying behavior. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are detected. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
