{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS SDK sessions, handling credentials, regions, profiles, and resource creation.",
  "sources": "Parameters and environment variables supplying credentials, region, profile, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Credential and configuration data flow into client and resource creation, which are standard SDK operations.",
  "flows": "Sources (credentials, region, profile) flow into client/resource constructors; no suspicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Event registration and resource factory usage are typical SDK extension points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS SDK session management class, following best practices. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Credential handling is via parameters and environment, with no hardcoded secrets. Event handlers and resource factory injections are SDK extension points, not malicious hooks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS SDK session class with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, reflecting standard SDK configuration and resource management without malicious activity.",
