  "purpose": "Define utility classes and functions for managing AWS service context, dynamic module importing, lazy loading of waiter models, and injecting attributes into class definitions.",
  "sources": "import_module function, lazy_call function, ServiceContext class, LazyLoadedWaiterModel class, and the initial imports.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; functions perform safe import, attribute injection, and method invocation without untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "import_module used in lazy_call to dynamically load modules; get_waiter in LazyLoadedWaiterModel retrieves waiter models via session object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility constructs for managing AWS service models and waiters, with functions for dynamic importing and attribute injection. No unsafe code, malicious activity, or suspicious data flows are detected. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or client library and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward, serving typical SDK purposes.",
