  "sources": "import_module function, lazy_call function, ServiceContext class, LazyLoadedWaiterModel class",
  "sinks": "getattr in lazy_call, import_module, attribute injection in inject_attribute",
  "flows": "import_module called with module name -> getattr used to invoke functions; lazy_call invokes dynamically imported functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and reflection (getattr), which could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but in this context are controlled",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for module import, dynamic function invocation, attribute injection, and lazy loading of waiter models. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The dynamic import and reflection are standard in SDKs but could pose risks if inputs are untrusted. The code is well-structured, readable, and performs controlled operations. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The potential security concern is the use of dynamic features, which is acknowledged in the risk score but is typical for SDK internal mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of dynamic import and reflection introduces minimal risk in a controlled environment, reflected in the low security risk score. Overall, the code is safe and standard for SDK utility functions.",
