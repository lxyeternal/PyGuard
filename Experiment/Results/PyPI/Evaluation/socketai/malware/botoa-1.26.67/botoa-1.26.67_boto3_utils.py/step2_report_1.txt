  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is primarily utility functions and classes for managing AWS SDK components, with dynamic import, lazy loading, and attribute injection.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The dynamic import and reflection mechanisms are standard in SDKs but could be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system manipulation, are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, standard utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal given the controlled nature of the functions. The high confidence aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard utility code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; scores are reasonable.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with dynamic import and reflection, potential risk if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score is justified because dynamic import and 'getattr' can be misused if inputs are malicious. However, within a controlled SDK environment, this is standard. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; potential risk if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning as Report 3; the risk score is appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with dynamic features; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but consistent with the analysis. The security risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (0.2) in reports 3, 4, 5 due to dynamic import and reflection, which could be risky if misused, but in SDK context, this is acceptable.\n- **Confidence levels:** Generally high, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic import and reflection, which are standard but could be misused if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign a risk score reflecting the potential for misuse, I might consider 0.2 appropriate, given the controlled context. The malware score remains at 0 because there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- No changes needed unless further context indicates untrusted inputs or supply chain concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears safe, with minor caution warranted due to dynamic features. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
