  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the report correctly notes standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low risk score (0.1) is justified, as the code uses dynamic imports and reflection, which could be risky if misused, but here appears controlled.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is standard utility code with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None apparent; the functions are typical for SDK utility modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the low risk score is justified.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still low, considering dynamic import and reflection.\n- **Justification:** While dynamic import can be risky if inputs are untrusted, in this context, it appears controlled.\n- **Overall assessment:** No malicious intent; the score is reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies; the code is typical for SDK utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Dynamic import and attribute injection are standard but could be risky if misused; however, no evidence of misuse here.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning; dynamic features are typical in SDKs, with no malicious intent.\n- **Overall assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting the potential risks of dynamic import and reflection, but justified given the controlled context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are reasonable.\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, justified risk due to dynamic features but controlled)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility module for AWS SDKs, with no security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.",
