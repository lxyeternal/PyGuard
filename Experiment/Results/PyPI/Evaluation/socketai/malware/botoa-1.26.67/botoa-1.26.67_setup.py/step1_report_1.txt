  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'botoa' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'boto3/__init__.py' to extract version, reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted data sources or potentially dangerous sinks such as network, file write, or eval.",
  "flows": "Extracts version from a package file; reads static files for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: importing modules, defining dependencies, reading static files for metadata, and configuring package setup with setuptools. It reads version info from a package file in a safe manner, and there are no indications of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected actions for package configuration without involving any suspicious or unsafe operations.",
