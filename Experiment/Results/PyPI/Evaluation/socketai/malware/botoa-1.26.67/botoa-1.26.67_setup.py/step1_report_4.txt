{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the boto3-based library 'botoa', including dependency management and package data inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for version info, reading README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Reading __init__.py to extract version -> passing dependencies and package data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs. Standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup using setuptools. It reads version info from __init__.py via regex, loads a README file, and specifies dependencies and package data. No code injections, no network calls, no credential handling, and no obfuscated code are present. The code strictly handles package metadata and data inclusion without executing external or untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious or security risks detected.",
