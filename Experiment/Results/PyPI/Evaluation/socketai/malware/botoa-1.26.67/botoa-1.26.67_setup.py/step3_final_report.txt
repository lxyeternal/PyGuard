  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'botoa', configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading static files (__init__.py for version, README.rst for description).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; only static file reads and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Static file contents flow into setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading version info via regex from a local file, reading static description, and calling setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The regex-based version extraction is standard and safe. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. Scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the script's safety and correctness.",
