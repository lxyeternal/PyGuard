{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the boto3-like SDK, primarily to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py to extract version, reading README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading version from __init__.py -> passing data to setup() function, reading README for description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no network activity, no malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports modules, reads package version info from __init__.py, reads README for description, and calls setup() with static package info and requirements. The get_version() function reads a file and extracts a version string, which is standard. All data read operations are from static files, and no untrusted inputs are processed. No suspicious code, no hidden behaviors, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It securely reads static files for package configuration and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
