{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for AWS Boto3 SDK errors, primarily for error handling and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (botocore.exceptions) and class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data or executes untrusted input; it mainly raises exceptions with constructed messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exception messages are constructed from trusted parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and other imported exceptions. The classes include constructors that format messages based on input parameters, but do not process untrusted data in a way that would cause security issues. The code lacks network operations, data leaks, or code injection vectors. It appears to serve as error handling infrastructure for AWS SDK operations, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in AWS Boto3 SDK, with no signs of malware or security risks. It is safe and has no malicious behavior.",
