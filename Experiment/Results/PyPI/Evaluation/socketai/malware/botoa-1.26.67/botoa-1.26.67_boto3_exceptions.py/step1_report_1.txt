{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to Boto3 and botocore in AWS SDK operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code consists solely of class and exception definitions without input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports botocore.exceptions and defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception or other base exceptions, including subclasses that combine botocore exception classes for backward compatibility. The classes generate specific error messages when instantiated, aiding in AWS SDK error handling. No input parsing, data processing, network activity, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for AWS SDK error management.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this code. It serves as a typical error handling module with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
