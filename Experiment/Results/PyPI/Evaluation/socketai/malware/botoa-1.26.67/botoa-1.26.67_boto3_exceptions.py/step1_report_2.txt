{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to AWS services using Boto3 and Botocore, providing structured error handling for AWS resource interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and exception initializations; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input to critical functions are present; the code primarily defines error classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling definitions with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from botocore.exceptions and defines several custom exception subclasses for AWS-related errors. Each class is used for specific error scenarios, such as resource not found, API version issues, or transfer failures. All class implementations are straightforward and involve standard exception messaging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code includes a deprecated class name with a typo, which appears to be a backward compatibility fix but is not malicious. No external input processing, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations.",
