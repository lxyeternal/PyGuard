  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, including error messages and backward compatibility support.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and message formatting within exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data inputs; purely static class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception instantiation occurs locally with static messages.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name 'DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError' (likely a typo for 'DynamoDBOperationNotSupportedError') as a backward compatibility fix.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of straightforward exception class definitions for AWS SDK errors, with no data processing, network activity, or malicious logic. The only notable issue is a minor typo in a class name, which is explicitly marked as a backward compatibility measure. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The exception messages are constructed from parameters and do not involve untrusted data. The code is static and well-structured, adhering to standard Python exception practices. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor typo does not impact security but should be corrected for clarity. Overall, the code poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
