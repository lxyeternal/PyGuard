  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to AWS SDK (Boto3 and botocore).\n- No data processing, network activity, or external data handling occurs.\n- Exception messages are constructed from parameters; no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of Issues\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The reports state that the code is purely exception class definitions with no malicious behavior. This aligns with the code, which is straightforward class inheritance and message formatting.  \n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the typo in the class name `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError`, which is marked as a backward compatibility fix. This is not malicious but is a typo, which is acceptable here.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk / Overall Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points & Justifications\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and does not process untrusted data, network, or system modifications.\n- The typo in `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError` is noted but not malicious.\n- The backward compatibility class alias is not malicious but a minor code issue.\n\n**Any recommendations?**  \n- The typo could be corrected for clarity, but it does not impact security or maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Personal Estimation\n\nBased on all reports and analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor issue is a typo, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n| Score Type             | Estimated Value | Justification                                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score          | 0                 | No malicious activity or code present.                         |\n| Obfuscated Score       | 0                 | Code is straightforward class definitions, no obfuscation.   |\n| Security Risk / Overall| 0                 | No vulnerabilities, no untrusted data handling, no network activity.|\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The original reports are accurate and thorough. I concur with their assessments, and I would maintain the scores at zero across all categories.\n\n**End of analysis.**",
