  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to AWS SDK (Boto3 and botocore).\n- No data processing, network activity, or external input handling occurs.\n- The code primarily constructs error messages and raises exceptions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- One class contains a typo (\"DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError\") which is noted as a backward compatibility fix but is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward exception class definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n- **Suspicious anomalies:** No.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The class `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError` is a typo for `DynamoDBOperationNotSupportedError`. It's a backward compatibility fix, not malicious, but worth noting for code quality.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk; this is error handling infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, **all reports are consistent** with the code being benign, standard exception definitions for AWS SDK error handling.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in AWS SDK operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is a typo in a class name, which is not security-related but should be corrected for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
