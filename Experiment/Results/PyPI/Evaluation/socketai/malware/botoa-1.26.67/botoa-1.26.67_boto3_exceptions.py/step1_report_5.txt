  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS Boto3 SDK errors and related error handling.",
  "sources": "Importing botocore.exceptions; custom exception class definitions that may be instantiated or raised.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes are instantiated with static messages or parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes related to AWS Boto3 operations. It imports botocore.exceptions and defines several custom exceptions, mostly for error handling in AWS SDK interactions. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. Exception messages are constructed dynamically but only from provided parameters, with no indication of malicious intent. There is no obfuscation, code injection, or hidden behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward exception hierarchy setup for AWS SDK error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.",
