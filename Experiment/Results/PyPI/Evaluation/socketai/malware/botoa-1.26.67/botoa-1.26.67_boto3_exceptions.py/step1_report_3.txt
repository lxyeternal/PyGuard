{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in the Boto3 AWS SDK for Python, mainly related to AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiations and exception handling scenarios, which are typical for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Error messages are constructed and passed to exception constructors; no data is sent over networks or external channels.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with descriptive messages; no flow of untrusted data into external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is purely for error handling and exception management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python and botocore exceptions. It constructs descriptive error messages but does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. No input/output sources or sinks indicate any malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden malicious intent. The code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling for a software library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for AWS SDK error management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks.",
