  "purpose": "This code snippet is a license header comment containing licensing information and legal notices.",
  "sources": "The entire code is a comment block; no data sources or input points are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flows exist; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden malicious elements; it is a straightforward license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment block with licensing information, containing no executable code, data handling, or input/output operations. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header comment with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) is justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
