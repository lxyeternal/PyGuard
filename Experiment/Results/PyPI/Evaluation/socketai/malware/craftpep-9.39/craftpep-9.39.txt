      "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional behavior are red flags for supply chain malware or backdoor activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware potential is significant. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its purpose."
