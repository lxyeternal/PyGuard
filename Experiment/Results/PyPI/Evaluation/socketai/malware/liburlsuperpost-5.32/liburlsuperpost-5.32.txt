      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating malicious intent. The package setup is standard but overshadowed by the malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with high malware (around 0.8-0.9), obfuscation (around 0.8-0.9), and security risk (around 0.8) reflecting the significant threat posed by this code."
