{
  "purpose": "Set up and install the 'websoocket-client' Python package, including complex obfuscated code that appears to manipulate system files, environment variables, and potentially execute system commands.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments (sys.argv), importing modules (sys, distutils.core, pip, os, win32com, ctypes), environment variables (os.getenv), and system paths (os.path functions). Encoded strings and obfuscated variable names used throughout suggest dynamic code execution or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential file operations (open, write, close, os.makedirs, os.path.expanduser, os.path.basename, os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, os.path.isdir), system command executions (pip.main, os.system, os.getenv), registry or shortcut creation (Dispatch, CreateShortcut), and file manipulations. Obfuscated code also hints at dynamic execution of code snippets or script generation.",
  "flows": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, and filesystem paths. The code heavily encodes strings and conditions that trigger file system changes, registry modifications, or command execution. Many variable values are calculated via complex bitwise and arithmetic operations, potentially controlling flow to malicious sinks like file writes or process creation.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated string manipulations using dynamic string assembly from character codes, unusual variable names (e.g., 馬女水女口目人馬鳥月水馬山山馬鸟). Repeated complex bitwise operations to generate string literals and control flow, often used in malware to evade static detection. Multiple conditional branches execute system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, modifying files, and calling system APIs, which are not typical for legitimate package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to perform setup operations for a package called 'websoocket-client', but is heavily obfuscated with complex bitwise and string operations. It dynamically constructs strings that are used to invoke modules, create shortcuts, and manage files. Several parts of the code execute system commands, modify files, or interact with environment variables, which could be malicious. The obfuscation is consistent with malware techniques to hide malicious intent. There is no clear benign functionality beyond the initial package setup, and the presence of code that manipulates system files, calls external APIs, and executes commands suggests possible malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with complex string and number manipulations designed to conceal its true behavior. It attempts to perform system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, modifying files, and executing system commands. These actions, combined with the obfuscation, indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially as a supply chain attack or backdoor. The setup function appears legitimate on the surface but is embedded within malicious-looking code.",
