  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources identified; no external input or data read operations indicated.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data exfiltration points detected; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed; code seems straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates a lack of suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are consistent with the benign description. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the absence of suspicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
