  "obfuscated": 0.3,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign or minimally suspicious, but some reports indicate moderate to high malicious potential, especially where dynamic execution and obfuscation are involved. Adjusting report 3's malware score to 0.4 and report 4's obfuscated score to around 0.3 improves alignment with observed behaviors. The overall security risk remains moderate to high, emphasizing the need for further static and dynamic analysis for confirmation."
