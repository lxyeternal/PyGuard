{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package called 'selfrecpu' with some package metadata and attempts to execute a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of 'tahg' directory, attempting to import subprocess and os modules, and executing a subprocess command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command which, if malicious, could be used to run arbitrary code or perform malicious actions on the system.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> If not exists, execute PowerShell command (potentially malicious) -> Setup package metadata",
  "anomalies": "The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with minimal visibility, potentially indicating obfuscation. The URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' is suspicious and may be related to malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions if the directory exists, but silently attempts to run hidden code otherwise.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core, then tries to import subprocess and os. If the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which could be malicious. The command is hidden and not immediately readable, a common tactic to obfuscate malicious intent. The setup function is called with package details, which appears legitimate. However, the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command and the suspicious URL indicates potential malicious activity intended to run arbitrary code or establish a backdoor during the package installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command that executes when the 'tahg' directory does not exist. This behavior, combined with the suspicious URL, suggests malicious intent or at least malicious potential. The setup process itself appears legitimate, but the hidden code execution is highly suspicious and could compromise the system if used maliciously.",
