      "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, conditional PowerShell payload executed during package setup, representing a significant security threat. The suspicious obfuscation, stealth execution, and context suggest malicious behavior, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package should be considered high risk and avoided unless further decoding confirms safe behavior."
