  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network operations, or any executable logic that could pose a security risk.\n   - The code appears straightforward, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no suspicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in these summaries.\n   - The only minor note is that all reports assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The `risk` scores are also 0, which aligns with the findings.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified due to the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score higher than 0.5 since there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is purely for error categorization and does not interact with external data or systems.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious code are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that the code is simple class definitions.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions with no executable logic, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a typical purpose within a larger application. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
