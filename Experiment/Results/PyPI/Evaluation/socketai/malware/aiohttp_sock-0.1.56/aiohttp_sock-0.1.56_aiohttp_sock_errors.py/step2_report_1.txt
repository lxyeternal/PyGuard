  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a set of custom exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- They consistently state that the code is straightforward, contains no obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious constructs.\n- No external data sources, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- The classes inherit from standard exceptions and serve error categorization purposes.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description: it is purely class definitions for exceptions.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are detected.\n   - The code is standard and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero.\n   - This is appropriate, as the code is purely structural and error handling related.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code snippet is a typical pattern for defining exception classes in Python.\n- It plays no role in supply chain security threats on its own.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the reports and the code's nature.",
