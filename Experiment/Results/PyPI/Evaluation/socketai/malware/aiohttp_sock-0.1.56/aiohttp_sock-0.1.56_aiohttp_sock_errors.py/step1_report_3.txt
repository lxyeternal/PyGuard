{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows, input/output handling, or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exception handling with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes (Exception, OSError) and contain no executable code, data handling, or external dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data leakage mechanisms. The structure and content are typical for exception class definitions used for error handling in network-related modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for handling SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks within this snippet.",
