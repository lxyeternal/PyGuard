  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network operations, or any executable logic.\n   - The code appears straightforward, adhering to standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No report makes unsupported claims; all emphasize the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores all at 0.\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature—simple class definitions with no suspicious or malicious content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely structural and has no executable or network-related logic, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's explicit content.\n   - No speculative claims are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/securityRisk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are evident.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, I concur with the existing scores.\n- My own estimate for the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores would be:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because the code is just class definitions; no operational logic)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, standard exception class definitions for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
