  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No external data sources, input handling, or data processing are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, inheriting from standard exceptions, with no executable code or external dependencies.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across reports, appropriate given the code.\n- Security risk: consistently 0, correct as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated: 0, accurate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- Confidence: 1, justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- No claims seem to be based on unwarranted assumptions; all reports correctly state the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling.\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious behavior).\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (no obfuscation).\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risk).\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet appears to be a typical part of a larger network library or application, serving as error categorization without any security concerns.",
