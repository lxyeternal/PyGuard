  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The classes serve to categorize errors related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for defining exceptions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard.",
