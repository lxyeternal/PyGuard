  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy and connection errors.\n- There are no signs of data handling, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is straightforward, adhering to standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not include any malicious payloads, backdoors, or behavior that could be exploited.\n- The exception classes are used for categorizing errors and are typical in network-related modules.\n- Since the code is purely structural, it does not pose any security risks by itself.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n**Risk score considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no executable or data processing logic, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n- No reason to increase the risk score based on the current content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code appears safe, with no supply chain security concerns evident.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Final note:**\n- If this code is part of a larger codebase, the security implications would depend on how these exceptions are used, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
