{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it solely defines classes",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows as the code only declares exception classes without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code appears to be standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard exception types such as Exception, OSError, and built-in exceptions. The classes are named to reflect various SOCKS and proxy errors, and contain no executable logic or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs. All classes follow standard Python syntax and semantics, serving as error identifiers for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in SOCKS or proxy operations. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
