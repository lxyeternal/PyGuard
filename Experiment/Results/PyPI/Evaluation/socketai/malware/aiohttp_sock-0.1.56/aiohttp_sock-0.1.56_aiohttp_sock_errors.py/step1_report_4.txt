  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no data leaks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. These classes inherit from built-in exception types and serve to categorize different error conditions. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any malicious logic or suspicious behavior. No security risks are present based on this code snippet.",
