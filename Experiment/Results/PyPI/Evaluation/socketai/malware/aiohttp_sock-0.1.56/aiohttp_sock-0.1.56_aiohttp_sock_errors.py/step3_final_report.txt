  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; classes are purely structural with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exceptions. It contains no executable code, data processing, network operations, or external dependencies. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and purpose as error categorization classes confirm its safety and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security-related issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
