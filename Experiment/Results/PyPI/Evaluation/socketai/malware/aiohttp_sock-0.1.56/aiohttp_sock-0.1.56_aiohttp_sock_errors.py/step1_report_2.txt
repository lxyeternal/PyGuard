{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions; exceptions are defined but not used here.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution logic; just class inheritance structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, used for categorizing SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, external connections, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious intent are evident. The classes are straightforward and serve as error identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple set of exception class definitions for SOCKS and connection errors with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a normal part of a larger network application or library, with no indication of supply chain threats or malware.",
