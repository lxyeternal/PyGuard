  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the described logic, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code implements a proxy connector with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It uses user input for proxy URL construction and connection handling. No backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is standard for proxy handling, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate given the lack of sensitive data exposure or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles proxy setup securely, with no suspicious behaviors. It notes that proxy credentials are passed via parameters, not hardcoded.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment**: The analysis aligns with the code. No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on the standard nature of the proxy classes, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment**: Correct. The code appears to be a legitimate proxy handler without malicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is a typical aiohttp proxy connector with no signs of malicious behavior. Proxy URL construction and socket handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment**: Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, describes a standard proxy connector with no malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, and typical handling of proxy credentials.\n\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score**: 0.2 seems appropriate; while the code handles sensitive data (proxy credentials), it does so securely and without malicious intent. No evident vulnerabilities or data leaks are present.\n\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 across reports is justified given the thorough reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk**: 0.2 (appropriate, given the handling of credentials but no malicious activity)\n- **Confidence**: 0.9 (well-founded)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The code is standard, with no obfuscation or backdoors.\n- The handling of proxy credentials and URL construction is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The use of external functions like `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` is assumed safe, as no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n**Final conclusion**: The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. The code appears secure, with no malware or obfuscation, and a low security risk score is justified.",
