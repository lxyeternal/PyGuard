{
  "purpose": "Define custom proxy resolver and connector classes for HTTP communication, supporting proxies and DNS resolution options.",
  "sources": "Inputs include method parameters, class attributes, and URL parsing functions, notably from user-provided proxy URLs.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL generation and socket connection establishment, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "User-provided proxy URL -> parse_proxy_url -> ProxyConnector constructor -> proxy_url property -> socket creation and connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code structure follows standard proxy handling; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy classes for HTTP connections, allowing customization of proxy types, DNS resolution, and connection handling. It parses proxy URLs to construct connection parameters, and manages socket connections depending on proxy type. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The code handles input data (proxy URLs and credentials) cautiously without evident hardcoded secrets or dangerous behavior. There is proper separation of concerns, with no signs of data leakage, malicious command execution, or unintended data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of proxy connection handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected proxy configuration and socket management without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
