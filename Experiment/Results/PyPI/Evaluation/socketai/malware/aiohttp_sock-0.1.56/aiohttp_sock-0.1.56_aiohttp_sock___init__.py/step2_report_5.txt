  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the security implications based on the provided code and assessments.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard `__init__.py` for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling.\n   - It imports classes, error types, helper functions, and protocol constants from internal modules.\n   - It defines the package version and the public API via `__all__`.\n   - There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, and no user input handling.\n   - The code is purely structural, setting up module exports.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - The code structure is typical for a package's initialization module.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Scores**:\n   - The reports assign a very low `securityRisk` score (0.1) and zero malware risk.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - Since no actual data handling or network logic is present, the risk is minimal.\n\n4. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - All reports agree on zero malware, obfuscation, and high confidence (1).\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 might reflect a conservative acknowledgment that, in principle, if this package were compromised or misused, it could pose some risk, but as-is, it is safe.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural and does not process untrusted data.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code snippet.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal inherent risk given the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.1**  \n\nThese reflect the actual safety profile of the code snippet provided.",
