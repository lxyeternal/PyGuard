  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization module for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy handling, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module attribute definitions, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward package setup with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing internal modules, defining version and public API. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports agree that it is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with its benign nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
