{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to SOCKS proxy connections, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly exports classes and functions related to proxy connection handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as the code only defines imports, constants, and exports without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an __init__.py file, setting up module exports and versioning for a proxy-related package. It imports relevant classes, error types, and helpers, then defines the public API via __all__. There are no functions executing code, no user input handling, and no network activity. The structure is typical for a Python package's entry point. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script for a proxy connection library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. The module appears safe and straightforward.",
