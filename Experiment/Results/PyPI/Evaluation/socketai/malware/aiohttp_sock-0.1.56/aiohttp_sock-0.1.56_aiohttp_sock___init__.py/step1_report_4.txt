{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for handling proxy connections, defining imports, version, and exportable symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external network interactions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code mainly imports and exposes symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code behavior observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules related to proxy connection handling and error management. It sets a version string and defines the __all__ list for exports. No user input handling, network calls, or external data processing are present. The code structure is straightforward, typical for a module initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a standard module initializer and export definition.",
