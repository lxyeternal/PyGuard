{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports components related to proxy connections, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types, likely for use in establishing and managing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), version string __version__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no functions or code that process external input or write output directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only module setup and exports are present",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The version string and imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements, variable definitions (__version__, __all__), and no executable logic or data processing. It functions as an interface or package export module. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as an interface for proxy-related functionalities, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and typical for a Python package component.",
