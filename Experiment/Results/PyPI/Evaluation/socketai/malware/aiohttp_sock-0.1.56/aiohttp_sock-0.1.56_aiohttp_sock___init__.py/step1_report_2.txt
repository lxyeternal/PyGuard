{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components related to proxy connections, including connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types, likely for a networking library handling SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "The code sources data mainly from imported modules: connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows from sources to sinks within this code segment; it primarily imports and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation, is observed. The version string and module exports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script, importing various classes and functions from internal submodules and setting up module exports. No data input, processing, or external communication is present. The absence of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic indicates standard library setup. The version string is a typical module version indicator. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization script for a proxy-related library, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a component for a larger system and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
