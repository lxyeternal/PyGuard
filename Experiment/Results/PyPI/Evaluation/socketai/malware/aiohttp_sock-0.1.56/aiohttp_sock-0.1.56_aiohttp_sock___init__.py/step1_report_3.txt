{
  "purpose": "To provide a proxy connection interface with error handling and helper functions for network communication",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily defines imports and exports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only module setup and import statements",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization file that imports specific classes and functions, assigns versioning, and defines exports. It does not contain data processing, network connections, or execution of dynamic code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure appears to be standard for a Python package module, focusing solely on setup and interface exposure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module definition with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply imports and exposes certain components related to proxy handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
