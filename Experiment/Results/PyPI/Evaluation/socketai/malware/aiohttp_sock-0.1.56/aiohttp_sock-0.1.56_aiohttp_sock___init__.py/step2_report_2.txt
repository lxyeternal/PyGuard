  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing modules and defining exports.\n   - No evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, establish network connections, or execute any runtime logic that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and standard for a Python package's `__init__.py` file.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the consensus, there is no justification for raising the risk or malware scores above 0.5.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the assessments are consistent with the code's actual content.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n   - The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, as it's a package setup script with no security concerns)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package initialization module. All reports correctly identify its safety and lack of malicious intent. No changes to their scores are necessary.",
