  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code is a typical `__init__.py` module for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy connections. It imports internal modules (`connector`, `errors`, `helpers`, `proto`), defines a version string, and specifies what symbols are publicly accessible via `__all__`. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and standard for a package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious activity or suspicious behavior:** None. All reports agree that the code is a standard package initialization script.\n- **Code logic and data flow:** No data flows from untrusted sources, no user input handling, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** None.\n- **Malicious patterns or backdoors:** No evidence.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The code is simple and clean, with no apparent security risks.\n- The overall security risk score assigned is very low (0.1 or 0), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** The scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- Since the code is just an import and export setup, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk should stay minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** I agree with the assigned scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (or 0), since there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard module initializer with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no data flow from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, typical for a Python package's `__init__.py`.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The risk remains very low, and malware/obfuscated scores are correctly set at 0.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, depending on strictness)\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions and the code's safety.",
