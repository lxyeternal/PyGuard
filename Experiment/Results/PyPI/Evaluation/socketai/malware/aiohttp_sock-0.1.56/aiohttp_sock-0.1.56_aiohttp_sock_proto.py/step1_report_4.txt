{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including negotiation, connection, and authentication procedures.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports provided for proxy and destination addresses, as well as optional user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets for proxy negotiation, connection establishment, and authentication. The code also receives data from network sockets for these purposes and address resolution.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows into methods that construct and send request packets; these requests flow through socket send functions to proxy servers. Responses flow back into receive functions, leading to validation and further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward network socket operations and address resolution; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. No attempts to exfiltrate data or execute malicious payloads are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a structured, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy negotiation in an asynchronous context. It includes error handling for common network and protocol errors, and supports both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with optional user authentication. The address resolution accommodates both local and remote DNS resolution. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. Usage of standard socket and asyncio libraries aligns with typical proxy client implementations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with authentication. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected based on the provided code. It operates within expected parameters of a proxy client library.",
