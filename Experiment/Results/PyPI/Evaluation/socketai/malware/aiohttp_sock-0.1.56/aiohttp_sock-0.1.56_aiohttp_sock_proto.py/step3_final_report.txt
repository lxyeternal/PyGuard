  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client protocols for asynchronous network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads hostnames/IP addresses for destination, proxy server address, and user credentials (if any).",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; potential data leakage if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) → address resolution or direct IP usage → proxy negotiation → data transmission over socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard protocol handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It performs address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation according to protocol specifications. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code's purpose is legitimate proxy communication, with no signs of malicious intent or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.",
