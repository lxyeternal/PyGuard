  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/5 proxy client implementation, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It handles connection, negotiation, and data transfer properly.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are evident. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and adheres to protocol specifications.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — low, given the code's nature; some minimal risk exists if used maliciously, but no vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scoring. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and proper error handling.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None detected.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 — low, consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client with correct protocols, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — low, acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no suspicious activity, no backdoors, and standard implementation.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client code, no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal inherent risks in proxy code, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy clients.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, given the nature of the code; some residual risk if used maliciously, but no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's actual behavior.",
