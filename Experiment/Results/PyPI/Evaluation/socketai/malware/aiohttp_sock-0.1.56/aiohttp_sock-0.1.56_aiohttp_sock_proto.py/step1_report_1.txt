{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling clients to connect through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket connections during negotiation and data transmission (sock_recv, sock_sendall), address resolution via getaddrinfo, and user-provided hostnames for proxy and target addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over sockets during negotiation, connection establishment, and data forwarding; potentially vulnerable if malicious data is injected or if the proxy handles untrusted data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input sources (address resolution, hostname input, socket data) flow into connection and negotiation procedures; data sent and received through sockets during these processes, potentially including untrusted hostnames or proxy addresses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard socket and asyncio functions. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution. The code appears to implement standard proxy protocols without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection wrappers using asyncio for asynchronous socket operations. It correctly handles address resolution, protocol negotiation, and data transmission. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code only facilitates proxy connections and does not perform any suspicious actions beyond intended proxy functionalities. The code also does not contain any hardcoded secrets or covert channels. Overall, it appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of proxy client logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evidence of malicious intent. It performs expected network operations for establishing proxy connections. The code is clear, structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or hidden functionalities. No security risks are identified within this module.",
