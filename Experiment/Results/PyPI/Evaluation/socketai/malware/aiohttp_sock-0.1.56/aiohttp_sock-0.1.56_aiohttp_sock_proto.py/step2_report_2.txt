  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — somewhat low but not negligible; possibly due to the inherent risks in proxy code if misused.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard and free of malicious intent. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity is suggested.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy client, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The assessment aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is thorough and reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Scores for malware are all 0, which is consistent.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the potential risks inherent in proxy code but not indicating malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), justified by the detailed reasoning.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — low, considering the nature of proxy code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Continue monitoring for any indirect malicious uses, but based on the code alone, it appears safe.\n\n**Overall, the scores and reasoning across all reports are consistent and justified.**",
