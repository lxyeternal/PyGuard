{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of classes for establishing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections, handling authentication, address resolution, and connection negotiation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and internal function parameters (e.g., destination host/port).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets; particularly, the code sends proxy negotiation requests, authentication data, and receives responses. Potential sink points include socket.sock_sendall and socket.sock_recv methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows into socket request construction functions, then transmitted over network sockets; responses are received and processed, influencing subsequent control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code performs standard address resolution and proxy negotiation. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. Error handling appears appropriate. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration attempts are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy client logic for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It uses safe socket operations, proper exception handling, and avoids executing untrusted code or using insecure practices. No indications of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data theft, or unauthorized system access are found. The code appears to be a legitimate proxy client implementation designed for network communication, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation. It does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected network proxy negotiation functions without insecure practices or malicious code. Overall, the code is safe and primarily intended for network proxy connections.",
