{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing applications to connect through a proxy server to target destinations asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters (host, port, user credentials), socket operations (_loop.sock_recv, _loop.sock_sendall, getaddrinfo), and network responses (proxy server replies).",
  "sinks": "Sends data to the proxy server (_send), receives data from the proxy server (_receive), and resolves host addresses (getaddrinfo).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build and send proxy connection requests (_send). Responses from the proxy are read (_receive) and interpreted to establish the connection. Address resolution occurs via getaddrinfo. No untrusted user input directly influences sensitive data or system commands outside network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and established protocols. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected. Error handling is conventional, with specific exceptions for proxy-related errors.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an asynchronous SOCKS proxy client, implementing standard protocols with proper error handling and address resolution. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network misuse are evident. The logic strictly adheres to protocol specifications, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. It appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant implementation intended for secure proxy connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, protocol-specific implementation for SOCKS proxies, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical network proxy operations safely and correctly, with appropriate error handling. There is no evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious actions.",
