  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and assess the scores for malware, obfuscated code, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard proxy connection procedures.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, standard implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, considering proxy setup).  \n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior detected. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, standard proxy client code.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, protocol-compliant implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy client logic.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard SOCKS proxy client with address resolution and negotiation.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, protocol-compliant code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard SOCKS proxy connection code.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code analysis supports this. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert channels are evident.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation according to protocol specifications. No suspicious behaviors, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to proxy code but no security issues)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the detailed review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
