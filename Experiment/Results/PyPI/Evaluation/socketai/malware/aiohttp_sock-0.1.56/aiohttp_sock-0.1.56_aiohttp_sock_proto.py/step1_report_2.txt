{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connection to proxies, negotiation, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly involved through the host, port, username, and password parameters; network address resolution via getaddrinfo; data being sent and received over sockets.",
  "sinks": "Socket send and receive operations, specifically sock_sendall and sock_recv methods, where data flows to and from the network, including proxy negotiation and destination communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into address resolution and socket connection routines, then through negotiation functions, with data exchanged over network sockets during proxy negotiation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard proxy connection procedures. No hidden or unusual code patterns or secret data appear present. The only exception might be indirect user input handling, which is typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with functions for establishing connections and negotiating proxy protocols. It handles network communication securely by using asyncio's sock_sendall and sock_recv, with proper error handling and exception raising. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network leaks are evident. It does not contain code that would perform unauthorized actions outside the intended proxy functionality. The use of standard libraries and protocols appears legitimate. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no detectable malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs legitimate network proxy negotiations and socket communications with appropriate error handling. No security risks or malicious activities are identified.",
