  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, decoding and executing obfuscated scripts capable of system compromise. The pattern aligns with malware behavior, warranting a malware score of 1, obfuscation score around 0.9, and security risk near 1. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious."
