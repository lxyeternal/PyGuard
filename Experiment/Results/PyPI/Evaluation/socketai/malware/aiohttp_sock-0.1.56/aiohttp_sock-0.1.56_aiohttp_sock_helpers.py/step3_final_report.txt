{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to create SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, parse proxy URLs, and establish asynchronous network connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "URL parsing via 'parse_proxy_url', socket wrapper creation in 'create_socket_wrapper', input parameters for host, port, proxy URL, and credentials.",
  "sinks": "The connection functions ('open_connection', 'create_connection') that establish network connections through proxies, potentially exposing data if misused, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port) are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers which connect to target hosts; data flows through these sockets during connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Exception handling is standard; no covert channels or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection utilities, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It performs input validation, handles exceptions properly, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal inherent security concerns, primarily related to potential misuse if provided with malicious inputs. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
