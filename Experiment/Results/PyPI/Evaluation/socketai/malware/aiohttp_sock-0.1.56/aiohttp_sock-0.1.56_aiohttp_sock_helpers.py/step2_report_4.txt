  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The code implements asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.\n   - It includes URL parsing (`parse_proxy_url`) to extract proxy configuration.\n   - Socket wrappers (`Socks4SocketWrapper`, `Socks5SocketWrapper`) are created based on proxy type.\n   - Connection functions (`open_connection`, `create_connection`) utilize these wrappers to connect to target hosts.\n   - Proper input validation and exception handling are present.\n   - Usage of external libraries (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`) aligns with standard practices for proxy handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - Proxy URL parsing and socket creation follow expected patterns.\n   - No signs of data leakage, command execution, or covert channels.\n\n3. **Potential Security Concerns or Anomalies:**\n   - The code handles untrusted input (proxy URLs, host/port) carefully.\n   - Error handling is adequate.\n   - The functions are designed for legitimate proxy connection management.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.2 — Low, given the code's purpose and proper validation.\n\n5. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is standard, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They assign high confidence (0.9) and low malware/obfuscation scores.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code appears to be a well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- The code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above, confirming the code's benign nature.",
