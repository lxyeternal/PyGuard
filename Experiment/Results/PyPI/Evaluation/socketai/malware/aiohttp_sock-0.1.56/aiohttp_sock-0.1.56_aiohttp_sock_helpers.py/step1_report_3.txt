  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections for network communication.",
  "sources": "parsing proxy URL, input parameters for host, port, proxy URL, and socket connection functions",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection, sock.connect",
  "flows": "Input data from URL parsing or function parameters flows into socket creation and connection functions, which then initiate network connections",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious domain or IP addresses, no malicious API usage detected. Proxy URL parsing and socket creation appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for parsing proxy URLs, creating SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, and establishing network connections through proxies using asyncio. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for asynchronous network connections. No unusual or suspicious logic is observed. The functions rely on external libraries like yarl and aiohttp_sock, which are common for proxy handling. The flow from input parameters through socket creation to network connection is straightforward. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for establishing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. It follows standard practices for proxy connection management without apparent security risks.",
