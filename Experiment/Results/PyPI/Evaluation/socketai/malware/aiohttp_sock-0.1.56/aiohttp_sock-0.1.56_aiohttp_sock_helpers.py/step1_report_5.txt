{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, with support for proxy URL parsing and optional proxy authentication.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() reads the proxy URL; open_connection() and create_connection() read host, port, proxy parameters, and optional SOCKS URL; socket creation functions read proxy details and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Sockets created via Socks4SocketWrapper and Socks5SocketWrapper are used to connect to target hosts; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection use these sockets to establish network connections.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() extracts proxy details from URL -> create_socket_wrapper() creates proxy socket -> open_connection()/create_connection() connect to proxy -> socket connects to target host and port, passing data to network interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no apparent backdoors or hidden malicious code. Usage of standard proxy libraries and asyncio functions appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles proxy URL parsing, avoiding hardcoded secrets, and uses established libraries for socket and asyncio operations. It properly manages proxy types, connections, and parameters without suspicious behavior. There are no signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious logic. No external communications or system modifications are evident. The structure adheres to common asynchronous network connection patterns, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a network proxy client for SOCKS proxies, with standard parsing, socket creation, and connection procedures. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy connection handling.",
