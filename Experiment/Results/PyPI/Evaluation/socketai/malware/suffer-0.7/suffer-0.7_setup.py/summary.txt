  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. External factors such as the URL and package name are noted but do not constitute security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score can be conservatively set around 0.2 due to external concerns but no internal malicious activity."
