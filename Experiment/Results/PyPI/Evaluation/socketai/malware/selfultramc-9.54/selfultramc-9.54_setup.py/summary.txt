  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command during setup, conditioned on filesystem state, with embedded suspicious URL. The behavior aligns with tactics used in supply chain attacks or backdoor installations. Scores are set high for malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.8), reflecting significant concern and warranting further decoding of the payload."
