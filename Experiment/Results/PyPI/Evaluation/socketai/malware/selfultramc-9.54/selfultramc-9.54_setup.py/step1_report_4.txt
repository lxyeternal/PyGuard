{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package named 'selfultramc', which includes some obfuscated code that executes a PowerShell command when certain conditions are met.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of a directory 'tahg' and potentially executes a subprocess if it doesn't exist.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with encoded commands, which could be used to run malicious code or perform unwanted actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if not present, executes the encoded PowerShell command -> the command may perform further malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command that is base64-encoded, executed without user consent, and bypasses typical visibility, which is suspicious. No legitimate reason for this behavior is apparent in a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a typical setup import but then attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and, if not found, executes an encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a common technique to hide malicious commands. The setup function is called with package details but is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which could hide issues. The use of encoded commands and suppressed error handling in the context of a setup script suggests malicious intent or sabotage, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands executed during package setup, indicating malicious behavior aimed at executing unauthorized code. The attempt to hide this behavior and the encoded payload are significant security concerns.",
