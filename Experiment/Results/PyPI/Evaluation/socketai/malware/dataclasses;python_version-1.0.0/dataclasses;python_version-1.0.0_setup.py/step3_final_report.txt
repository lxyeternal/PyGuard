{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation by sending it to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "flows": "sources (system info) -> requests.get() (external request to webhook URL)",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user consent; hardcoded webhook URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when executed, collects system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external webhook URL. This behavior indicates malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration. The report responses are empty, lacking details or evidence, which hampers validation. Given the clear malicious intent, the malware score should be very high (close to 1), and the security risk should also be rated high (above 0.8). The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, so obfuscation score is low. The package name appears suspicious, potentially used to mimic legitimate packages. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat due to its malicious exfiltration behavior during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, representing a high security risk and malware threat. The existing reports lack sufficient detail, but the code's behavior warrants assigning a malware score near 1 and a high risk score. The package should be flagged as malicious, and the scores should be updated accordingly.",
