{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script that performs basic linting checks on a given Python file, specifically for trailing whitespace and missing final newline.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a file specified by the user via the file path parameter in run_linter(), and from the hardcoded sample_code string used to create a test file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output messages to the console via print statements; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (file content) flows from the file read operation into the check functions, which analyze the content for formatting issues, and results are output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious operations are present. The functions perform straightforward string processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple text pattern matching to identify trailing whitespace and missing newline at the end of a file. It creates a sample file with specific content for testing. All operations are standard I/O and string processing, with no external or unsafe code execution. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward linter for code formatting issues. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It solely performs file reading and pattern matching for stylistic checks.",
