{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script designed to perform basic linting tasks, such as checking for trailing whitespace and missing newline at the end of a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a specified file path provided to the run_linter function, which opens and reads the content of that file.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs results to standard output (print statements); it does not write or transmit data elsewhere. No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input is read from the file in run_linter, processed by check_trailing_whitespace and check_missing_newline, then results are printed. No external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic linting but does not contain any anomalies, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code patterns. It is straightforward and consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to check for trailing whitespace and missing newline at file end, then applies these checks to a test file created within the script. No user input or external data sources are involved beyond file reading. The functions simply analyze text patterns and output results. There are no malicious code injections, network activities, or suspicious behaviors. The code is entirely benign, aimed at code quality enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward linter utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs simple static analysis without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
