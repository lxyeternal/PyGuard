  "purpose": "A Python script to format code files by removing trailing whitespace, replacing tabs with spaces, and ensuring a newline at EOF.",
  "sources": "Reading code from a string or file; input is provided via function parameters or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "Writing formatted code back to file; no untrusted data flows leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input code is read, processed by regex and string operations, then written back; no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a syntax bug: 'if not code ends with '\\n':' should be 'if not code.endswith('\\n'):'; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward formatting tasks without malicious intent. The only issue is a syntax error in the EOF check, which affects correctness but not security. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware behaviors are present. The reports are empty, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code is benign and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious formatter with a minor syntax bug. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal; the main concern is fixing the syntax error for proper execution.",
