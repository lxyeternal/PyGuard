{
  "purpose": "Collect and send system and import context information to a remote server for analytics purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform, uptime, hostname), call stack data, and package/module name.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to an external URL (webhook.site).",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system calls and traceback, then transmitted through a network request to an external endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed import stack traces and sends them externally without user consent or transparency, which could be considered privacy-invasive. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code are present. The URL used is a placeholder service (webhook.site) often used for testing, not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info such as OS, uptime, hostname, and the call stack, then identifies the context of the import based on the filename. It constructs a JSON payload with this info and sends it via a POST request to a specified external URL. This behavior appears designed for tracking or analytics rather than malicious intent. No suspicious or harmful operations (like data exfiltration of sensitive data, backdoors, or malware) are detected. The only potential concern is privacy invasion, as the code transmits detailed environment and stack data without user consent. The URL used is benign and for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an analytics tool that collects and transmits environment and import context information. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks beyond potential privacy concerns due to unconsented data sharing. No malware or obfuscated code detected. Overall risk is low.",
