  "purpose": "This __init__.py file serves as a minimal placeholder for the utils package, containing only comments and no executable code.",
  "sources": "The file contains only comments; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the file contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only comments with no executable code, imports, or suspicious patterns; no anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment-only __init__.py file with no executable content, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The file serves solely as a package marker, and there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving only as a package initializer with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores are justified and should remain at zero. No further action is necessary.",
