  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing an internal module during setup without validation poses a supply chain security risk. While no direct evidence of malicious code exists, this behavior warrants caution. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk around 0.6."
