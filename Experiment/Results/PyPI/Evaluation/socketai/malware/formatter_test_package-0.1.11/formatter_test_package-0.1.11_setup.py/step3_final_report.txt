  "purpose": "The code executes a subprocess running the internal module 'formatter_test_package.utils.analyzer' during package installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call: subprocess.call([sys.executable, '-m', f'{PACKAGE_NAME}.utils.analyzer']) within the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The execution of the 'analyzer' module via subprocess during setup, which could lead to code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious activity if the module is compromised.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess.call invocation; Sink: execution of 'formatter_test_package.utils.analyzer' during install process.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an internal module during setup without validation, sandboxing, or user confirmation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally runs an internal module during installation, which could be exploited if the module is malicious. The pattern of executing code during setup is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or secrets, but the lack of validation raises security concerns. Given the behavior, a malware score of approximately 0.4 is appropriate, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious content. The security risk score should be around 0.6, indicating moderate to high concern due to the potential for malicious activity if the module is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing an internal module during setup without validation poses a supply chain security risk. While no direct evidence of malicious code exists, this behavior warrants caution. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk around 0.6.",
