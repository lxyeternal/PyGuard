  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, encoded PowerShell command executed silently, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or establishing a backdoor. The obfuscation, external URL, and silent error handling significantly increase the security risk. These factors warrant classifying the package as high risk with a strong suspicion of malicious intent."
