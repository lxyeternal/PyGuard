  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SFTP/SCP file transfer utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to potential misuse of path interpolation with untrusted inputs, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
