  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling operations present; no data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Comment about moving code to another module suggests refactoring intent, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes are simple and do not execute any logic beyond storing data. There are no input operations, no network calls, no evaluation of untrusted data, and no suspicious code constructs. The comments hint at potential refactoring but do not introduce any malicious content. Overall, the code appears to be standard, straightforward exception class definitions with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception class definitions for managing application-specific errors. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security issues are present.",
