{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are simple class definitions extending Exception, with no code execution, data handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation is present. The comments suggest some context related to task invocation and environment validation, but no malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a larger application or library for handling errors.",
