  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior. It includes standard exception class structures with docstrings for context. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks. No inputs, outputs, or external data handling are present, reducing the likelihood of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for error handling in a Python project, with no signs of sabotage or malicious code.",
