  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential security implications, and scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with straightforward constructors and docstrings.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- Comments suggest potential refactoring or future code organization but do not imply malicious intent.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of the Reports**\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Only class definitions, no data flow or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard exception classes, with no security risks.\n- Confidence: 1 (high certainty)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Logical Flaws or Errors:**\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n**Scores:**\n- The assigned malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- Security risk scores of 0 are justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns or Overlooked Aspects**\n- The code is very simple; however, exception classes are sometimes used maliciously if misused in a larger context. But in this isolated snippet, no such behavior exists.\n- No signs of obfuscation or hidden payloads.\n- The comments hint at refactoring but do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification and Recommendations**\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThe code is entirely benign, serving as infrastructure for error handling in a larger application.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the code as harmless exception class definitions with no security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action or re-scoring is necessary.",
