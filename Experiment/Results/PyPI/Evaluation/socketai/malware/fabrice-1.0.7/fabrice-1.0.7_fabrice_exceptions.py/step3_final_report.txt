  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three exception classes with minimal logic, serving as infrastructure for error signaling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. Comments suggest potential refactoring but do not imply malicious intent. The code is static, simple, and standard, with no external interactions or dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and security risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
