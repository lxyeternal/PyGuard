  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n   - These classes are straightforward, with minimal logic (mainly constructors and docstrings).\n   - There are no external data reads, no network calls, no data processing, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - Comments suggest possible future refactoring, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, serving as infrastructure in a larger application.\n   - No external input handling or data sinks are present.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which aligns with the code.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The comments about moving code or refactoring are benign and do not suggest malicious activity.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is standard exception class definitions with no security risks.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence presented.",
