  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n   - All classes are straightforward subclasses of `Exception` with minimal constructors and docstrings.\n   - No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The comments suggest potential refactoring or future organization but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The code is purely infrastructural, intended for error handling within a larger application.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - Exception classes are standard practice and pose no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or code is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — Since the code only defines exceptions with no security-sensitive operations, the risk is negligible.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - The reports uniformly agree on the benign nature of this code.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior or security concern.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions with no security implications.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n   - The code does not warrant any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- I concur with the reports: the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for overall security risk.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
