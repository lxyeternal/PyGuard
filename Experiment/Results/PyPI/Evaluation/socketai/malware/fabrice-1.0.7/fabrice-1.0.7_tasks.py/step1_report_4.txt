  ],
  "analysis": "The code includes multiple points where sensitive information such as passwords and hostnames are hardcoded or set directly in environment variables. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, such as code injection or network exfiltration; however, the presence of hardcoded credentials and environment configuration indicates poor security practices. The installation of specific package versions and the configuration of remote connections involve sensitive data that, if misused, could facilitate unauthorized access. The script appears to be intended for testing and packaging purposes and does not demonstrate malicious intent or behavior. Nonetheless, the explicit hardcoded secrets and connection parameters represent significant security risks and should be handled securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior but contains serious security risks due to hardcoded secrets and configuration data. It appears to be a typical build/test script with insecure handling of credentials and connection details. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is high due to the exposure of sensitive information.",
