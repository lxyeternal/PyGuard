  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded secrets such as passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), gateways ('some-gateway'), and user info ('admin', 'localghost').",
  "analysis": "The code contains explicit hardcoded secrets used in test functions and configuration objects, which pose security risks if exposed. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is insecure handling of secrets, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build and deployment utility with significant security issues due to hardcoded secrets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from potential secret exposure, which should be mitigated by replacing hardcoded values with environment variables or secure secret management.",
