  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension facilitating remote task execution with flexible connection parameters. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring proper validation of user inputs outside this code to prevent misuse. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical concerns about untrusted input handling but not malicious behavior."
