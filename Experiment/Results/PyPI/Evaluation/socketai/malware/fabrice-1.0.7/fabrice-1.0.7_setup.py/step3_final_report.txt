  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, configuring package names, version retrieval, dependencies, and entry points based on environment variables and filesystem checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem directories, and a local '_version.py' file read via exec()",
  "sinks": "Execution of the contents of '_version.py' via exec()",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks influence package configuration; exec() executes code from '_version.py'",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local version file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no network activity or user input. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is a common but potentially risky pattern if the version file is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The environment variables and filesystem checks are safe. The use of exec() warrants caution but is typical in setup scripts; if the '_version.py' file is trusted and controlled, the risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard packaging script with a minor security concern regarding exec() on a local version file. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) due to the exec() pattern.",
