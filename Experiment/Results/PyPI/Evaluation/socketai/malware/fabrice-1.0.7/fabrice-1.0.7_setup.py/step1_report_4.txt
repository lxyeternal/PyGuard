{
  "purpose": "The script configures and sets up a Python package called 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' with dependencies and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file system directories, and file contents (README, _version.py).",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptool's setup() function to install dependencies, write package metadata, and define entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming; file reads (version and README) contribute to package info; setup() registers all configurations and scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity. The script performs standard setup tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package, including environment-based configuration, directory checks, reading version info, and preparing metadata. It does not include any malicious logic, network activity, or security issues. All data handling appears benign and aligned with normal packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to prepare and install a package, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
