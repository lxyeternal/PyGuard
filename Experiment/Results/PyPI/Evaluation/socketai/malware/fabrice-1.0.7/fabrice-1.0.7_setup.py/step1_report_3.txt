  "purpose": "Configure and set up the packaging information for a Python project named 'fabrice'.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), filesystem (os.path, open), package files (exec on _version.py, README.rst).",
  "sinks": "exec() execution of _version.py, reading files (README.rst), environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2).",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package and binary names. File reading of _version.py executes code to get version. Reading README.rst for long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from _version.py instead of importing; this could be risky if _version.py is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to decide package configuration, reads a version file with exec(), and reads README.rst for description. The use of exec() on a local file is potentially risky if the file contents are malicious or compromised. The rest of the code primarily deals with package setup details and appears standard. No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable influence is benign but could be manipulated to change package naming. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for packaging setup with a potentially risky use of exec() to read version information, but no malicious intent or harmful behaviors are evident. The main concern is the use of exec() on local files, which could be exploited if the version file is tampered with.",
