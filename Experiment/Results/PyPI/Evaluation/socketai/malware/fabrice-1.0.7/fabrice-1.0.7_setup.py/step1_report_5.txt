  "purpose": "Configure and set up the packaging of a Python project named 'fabrice' with conditional package and binary naming, and specify dependencies for installation and testing.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get(), os.path.abspath(), os.path.isdir(), open()",
  "sinks": "exec() to load version info, setuptools.setup() to install package",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package/binary names, open() reads README and version files, exec() loads version data, setup() installs the package",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate version file content could be risky if version file is malicious, but typical for reading version info; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no external data input beyond environment variables",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads environment variables, filesystem info, and files for setup. It uses exec() to dynamically load version info, which can be risky if the version file is malicious, but this is a common pattern in packaging. No untrusted data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated code detected. The dependencies and configuration are standard. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. No malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks for packaging a Python project with conditional logic based on environment variables and filesystem checks. The use of exec() for version reading is a common pattern but should be reviewed for external tampering, although unlikely here. Overall, no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
