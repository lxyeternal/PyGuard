      "conclusion": "The script is a standard build and deployment utility with significant security issues due to hardcoded secrets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from potential secret exposure, which should be mitigated by replacing hardcoded values with environment variables or secure secret management."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing SSH and command execution functionalities. The only security consideration is the hardcoded sudo password ('mypass'), which is acceptable in a controlled testing environment but should be avoided in production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, justified by the context. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present."

The low security risk score is justified, primarily due to potential misuse of path interpolation with untrusted inputs, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The primary security consideration is ensuring proper validation of user inputs outside this code to prevent misuse. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical concerns about untrusted input handling but not malicious behavior."
