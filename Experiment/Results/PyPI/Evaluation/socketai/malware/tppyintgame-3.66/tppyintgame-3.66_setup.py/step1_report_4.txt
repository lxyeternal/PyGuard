{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'tppyintgame' with a specified package and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system (os.path.exists), environment, and executes a subprocess command via subprocess.Popen with encoded PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command which, when decoded, may run potentially malicious commands or scripts; reading from the file system can also be a source of input if manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code checks for the existence of a file ('tahg') and then executes a PowerShell encoded command if the file does not exist. This command is executed with subprocess.Popen, potentially running malicious code. The setup function then executes, but is likely benign itself.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen; no clear benign purpose for this command; no license specified; exception handling suppresses errors silently; the code structure is unusual with try-except blocks around setup and subprocess calls, and the PowerShell command is heavily obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing setup from distutils.core and attempts to run a subprocess with a hidden PowerShell command if the file 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is Base64-encoded, which is often used to obfuscate malicious scripts. The setup function configures package details for 'tppyintgame'. The try-except blocks suppress errors silently, which can hide malicious failures. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent, such as executing remote code or installing backdoors. The setup itself appears legitimate, but the obfuscated code execution is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to have malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command without clear purpose. The code could be used to execute hidden or malicious scripts, making this package highly suspicious for supply chain attacks.",
