  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, indicating a high probability of malicious activity. The stealthy execution, obfuscation, and conditional trigger point suggest a supply chain backdoor or remote control mechanism. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend classifying this package as highly malicious and investigating the payload further."
