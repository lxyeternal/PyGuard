{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that, on Windows, downloads and executes an external executable file during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' via the requests.get() method.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved to the filesystem and then executed using os.system('start ' + filename).",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL request to writing the executable file, then from executing the file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an external executable during installation and automatically runs it without user consent or validation, which is highly suspicious behavior. No validation or integrity checks are performed on the downloaded file. The URL appears suspicious and unrelated to standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup parameters for a Python package, including a custom install command. During installation on Windows, it downloads a file from an external URL and executes it without verification, which is a common tactic for distributing malicious payloads. The direct execution of an external executable during package install is highly unusual and indicates malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The code does not perform any validation or checks on the downloaded content, increasing the risk of executing malicious code. The request to external server and immediate execution pose a serious security threat, especially given the domain's suspicious appearance.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation. It represents a security risk and could be used to install malware or backdoors on the target system.",
