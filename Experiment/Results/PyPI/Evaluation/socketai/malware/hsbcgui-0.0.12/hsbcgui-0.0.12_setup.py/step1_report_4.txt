{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with post-install behavior that downloads and executes an external file on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network using requests.get() to download a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file (DigitalPulse.exe) is executed directly via os.system('start '+filename), which runs the file on the user's system.",
  "flows": "Input source: URL request -> download file into local directory -> execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally downloads and executes an external executable on Windows systems during installation, which is suspicious and can be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package installation behavior. During installation on Windows, it retrieves an executable from an external URL and immediately runs it without any user confirmation or validation. This behavior resembles malware tactics such as remote code execution and system compromise. The code does not perform any verification of the downloaded file (e.g., checksum or digital signature), increasing risk. Such actions are highly unusual for legitimate package setup scripts and pose significant security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user consent or verification. This represents a high security risk and is strongly indicative of malicious intent.",
