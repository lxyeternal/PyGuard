{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'hsbcgui', and during installation on Windows systems, it downloads and executes an external executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe' via requests.get(), and reads files 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt' for the long_description.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the downloaded content directly to a file and then executes it using os.system('start '+filename), which can execute arbitrary code if the downloaded file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input source: URL content via requests.get() -> file write to 'DigitalPulse.exe' -> execution via os.system('start DigitalPulse.exe')",
  "anomalies": "Download and immediate execution of an external executable during installation is unusual behavior for a standard Python package, especially without user consent or validation. The URL used is suspicious, and the execution could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install command that, on Windows, downloads an executable from a specified URL and runs it. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor, as it executes an external program during package installation. The code uses requests to fetch the executable and os.system to run it, which can be dangerous if the URL points to malicious software. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign, with no other malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a potentially malicious behavior—downloading and executing an external executable during installation—which poses a security risk. It appears intentionally designed to run arbitrary code from an external source, making it highly suspicious and unsafe to use without further validation.",
