{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with post-install behavior that downloads and executes an external executable on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The 'app()' function downloads a file from a specified URL and executes it using os.system.",
  "sinks": "The open() call writes the downloaded content to a file, and os.system() executes the downloaded file, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Requests.get() fetches an external executable; the content is saved locally; os.system() runs the executable.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing an external binary during installation, especially without verification or user consent, is suspicious. The URL appears to be a direct link to an executable, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a post-install command that, on Windows, downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL and runs it immediately. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack, where malicious payloads are fetched and executed during package installation. There are no safeguards like checksum verification or user prompts. The rest of the code primarily handles package setup with no other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which can lead to remote code execution or system compromise. This behavior is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
