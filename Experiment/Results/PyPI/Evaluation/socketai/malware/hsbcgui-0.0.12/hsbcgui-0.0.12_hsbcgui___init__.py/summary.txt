  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risks, while report 5 shows suspicious features warranting moderate concern. The scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could increase malware suspicion slightly but are not necessary. Vigilance is advised for dynamic and obfuscated code, but current assessments are reasonable."
