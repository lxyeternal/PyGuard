{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package named 'rushbruhmalware' and execute obfuscated code, claiming it is malware.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded via zlib decompression and executed with exec.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded code via exec, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded, decompressed, and then executed directly, allowing the embedded code to run with full privileges.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated base64 data and zlib decompression in combination with exec to hide malicious intent; explicit claim that the code is malware within the description.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' but does not use it; instead, it executes a decompressed and decoded payload using exec, which is a common obfuscation technique for malicious code. The payload is a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed string that, once decoded, likely contains malicious instructions. The setup function defines a package named 'rushbruhmalware' with a description explicitly stating it is malware and advises against installation. The combination of obfuscation, the explicit malware label, and dynamic code execution strongly suggests malicious intent. No legitimate functionality is observed aside from the setup call. This pattern indicates deliberate concealment of malicious behavior, typical of malware distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated to conceal malicious code that is executed at runtime. The package is named and described explicitly as malware, and the dynamic execution of the decoded payload poses a significant security risk. It should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
