  "purpose": "Define a Python package named 'rushbruhmalware' with a clear warning that it is malicious.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string decoded via base64 and zlib, executed through exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded code, potentially executing malicious or obfuscated payloads.",
  "flows": "Base64 and zlib decoding -> exec() -> execution of the decompressed code",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64, zlib, and codecs to obfuscate code, followed by immediate execution with exec(). The package description explicitly states it is malware.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing setuptools and executing a decompressed, base64-encoded payload via exec(), which is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious code. The payload is compressed and encoded, likely containing malicious instructions. The setup() function defines a package with a name and description explicitly indicating malicious intent. The use of multiple modules to obscure code flow and the explicit labeling of the package as malware strongly suggest malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally obfuscated with encoding and compression, then executed dynamically, which is typical of malicious payloads. The package description explicitly states it is malware. Overall, this code is malicious and designed to deceive and potentially harm systems upon installation or execution.",
