{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data via Discord webhook and upload to anonymous file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser files (logins, cookies, local storage), Discord files, local system files, and user input via regex patterns, environment variables, and local state files.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include requests to external URLs (webhooks and file uploads), requests to Discord API endpoints, and local file writing and zipping operations which send or store stolen data.",
  "flows": "The code extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various locations, decrypts encrypted data using system APIs or stored keys, then uploads or sends this data through webhooks or file hosting services, effectively exfiltrating user information to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Indicators of malicious activity include use of hardcoded webhook URL, code that installs dependencies silently, extensive browser data harvesting, creation of zip archives of user files, multi-threaded zipping and uploading, and obfuscated or misleading variable names. Additionally, the code attempts to kill browser processes and then zips user data, which are typical tactics of stealer malware.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with import statements that include system and network libraries, and sets a Discord webhook URL for exfiltration. It installs dependencies silently, then defines multiple functions for decrypting stored data, retrieving user info, and exfiltrating it via Discord. It searches user directories for browser data, Discord data, and other application files, then extracts tokens, cookies, passwords, and files. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs and stored encryption keys, then uploads this data to anonymous file hosting sites or sends via webhook. It also kills certain processes before zipping files, indicating an attempt to ensure access and exfiltration. The code uses threading to handle multiple data sources concurrently. Finally, it performs a comprehensive collection of user data from browsers and applications, then exfiltrates it, which aligns with typical malware behavior designed for information theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious stealer designed to harvest a wide range of sensitive user data from browsers and applications, decrypt encrypted data, and exfiltrate it to external servers via webhooks and file uploads. It employs obfuscation techniques such as silent dependency installation, process termination, multi-threading, and data zipping to maximize data theft efficiency. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, data exfiltration routines, and aggressive file handling strongly indicates malicious intent and high security risk.",
