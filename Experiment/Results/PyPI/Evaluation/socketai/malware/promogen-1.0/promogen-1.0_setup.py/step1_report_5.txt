{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data extraction, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and files from users' browsers and systems, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user environment variables, local files (browser databases, local storage, cookies, logs), and network responses from APIs (IP geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through HTTP POST requests to external webhooks, file upload endpoints (gofile.io, anonfiles), and network requests involving request.urlopen, requests.post, and file uploads. Extracted credentials and sensitive info are exfiltrated immediately after collection.",
  "flows": "The code collects data from browser and application files, decrypts stored credentials, tokens, cookies, and passwords, then immediately uploads or sends this data to external servers via webhooks or file hosting services.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple indicators of malicious intent: use of hardcoded webhook URL, installing modules silently, copying and zipping user files, decrypting stored credentials, capturing tokens, cookies, passwords from various browsers and apps, and exfiltrating all data without user consent. Extensive use of threading for parallel execution and obfuscation of intent is evident. The code also kills processes, which can disrupt system stability and hide activities.",
  "analysis": "The script combines credential harvesting (browser passwords, cookies, tokens), system information gathering (IP, username), and file exfiltration (zipping and uploading sensitive files). It uses decrypted master keys for browser data, requests geolocation data, and sends collected info via Discord webhooks. The presence of hardcoded webhook, silent module installation, and aggressive file access point strongly toward malicious activity. Its structure facilitates persistent and comprehensive data theft with minimal user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed explicitly for data theft and system exploitation. It collects, decrypts, and exfiltrates user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from browsers and applications, using multiple network techniques to hide and transmit data. The code exhibits obfuscated and malicious behavior with no legitimate purpose apparent.",
