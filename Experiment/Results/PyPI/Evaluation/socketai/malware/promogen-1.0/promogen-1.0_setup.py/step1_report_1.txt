{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious script designed to steal user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and other sensitive information from browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and upload to external servers.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser local storage and leveldb files, log files (.log, .ldb), Chrome/Edge/Opera profile directories, Discord, Telegram, Steam, and other application directories; network responses for geolocation and token validation; and user environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration sinks include Discord webhook URL, requests to external file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), and sending detailed user info, tokens, passwords, cookies, and files over HTTP POST requests.",
  "flows": "The code scans local user directories for sensitive data, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, extracts tokens from browser logs and Discord files, then sends this data to remote webhooks or uploads files to external services. It also gathers and zips files based on certain keywords, then uploads them externally.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious behaviors include installing missing modules silently, decrypting browser data with master keys, extracting tokens with regex patterns, and the extensive collection of user data with no legitimate reason. The use of threading for data collection, obfuscation attempts (e.g., dynamic threading, complex functions), and hardcoded webhook URL strongly indicate malicious intent. Also, the code kills processes like browsers or applications, indicating malicious control over user environments.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing modules, including network, cryptography, and system utilities, with some modules installed dynamically. It retrieves the user's IP, geolocation, and system info. It then collects Discord tokens, user info, billing info, badges, and UHQ badges by querying Discord API endpoints with user tokens. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by extracting local state and leveldb files, decrypts data with Windows APIs and AES decryption, and searches for tokens in logs and local files. It gathers files matching certain keywords from user directories, zips them, and uploads or shares links. Threading is used extensively for parallel collection and zipping. All exfiltrated data is sent to a specified Discord webhook URL or uploaded to file hosting services. The code also contains functions to check trustworthiness based on cookie content, which, if flagged, halts execution. The overall structure, aggressive data extraction, and exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent, typical of info-stealers or malware aimed at user compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious info-stealer designed to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and sensitive user information from browsers and applications, then exfiltrate or upload this data remotely. Its techniques, including decrypting browser data, harvesting tokens via regex, and the hardcoded webhook, confirm malicious behavior. The script has no legitimate purpose and poses significant security threats.",
