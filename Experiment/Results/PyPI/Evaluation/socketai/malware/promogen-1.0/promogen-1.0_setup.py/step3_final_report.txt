{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info-stealer targeting user tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and environment info from browsers, applications, and local files. It decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens via regex, collects user data, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads, often terminating processes to facilitate data access.",
  "sources": "Local browser storage files (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Yandex), Discord directories, Telegram data, Steam config files, local system environment variables, and geolocation API responses.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL, requests to file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), network requests for data exfiltration, and file uploads of collected data and zips.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files and browser storage, decrypted using Windows APIs and stored keys, then sent via HTTP requests or uploaded to external servers. Threading is used for concurrent collection and zipping, with process termination commands to disable security software or browsers before data access.",
  "anomalies": "Silent installation of dependencies, hardcoded webhook URL, extensive multi-threaded data collection, process termination commands, obfuscation through misleading variable names and complex functions, and dynamic threading for zipping and uploading.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: decrypting stored credentials, extracting tokens with regex, collecting files based on keywords, terminating processes, and exfiltrating data via webhooks and uploads. It uses Windows API calls for decryption, threading for efficiency, and obfuscation techniques to evade detection. The code's structure and behaviors are consistent with a high-level info-stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for extensive data theft and exfiltration, with obfuscation and stealth tactics. It poses a severe security threat, justifying maximum malware and risk scores.",
