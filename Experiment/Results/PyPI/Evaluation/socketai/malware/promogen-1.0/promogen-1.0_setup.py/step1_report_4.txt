{
  "purpose": "The script is designed as a stealer to extract sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks or upload to file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from browser profile directories, log files, database files, local environment variables, and system directories. It also reads user data from files like 'Login Data', 'Cookies', and 'Local State'.",
  "sinks": "Code sends data to external webhooks (Discord), uploads files to external file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles), and executes commands to kill processes or remove files. It also potentially executes pip installs and subprocess commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser files and local storage (tokens, passwords, cookies, files), processed and decrypted in functions like getToken, getPassw, getCookie, getDiscord, and then sent via webhook or uploaded to hosting services. Network requests and file uploads are the primary sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Includes functions to install modules dynamically, perform multiple network requests with minimal error handling, use hardcoded webhook URL, kill processes forcibly, and upload sensitive information. Also, code is obfuscated or convoluted, making analysis difficult. Use of 'subprocess' and process termination commands suggest malicious intent. The script collects extensive user data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and files, then exfiltrates them.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive credential and data stealer targeting browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, Telegram, and various wallets or applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, retrieves tokens via regex, and collects files based on keyword matches. It then uploads the collected data to external services or sends via webhook. The code dynamically installs dependencies, terminates processes related to browsers or wallets to access data, and hides its activities. The inclusion of hardcoded webhook URL and process termination suggests malicious intent. The obfuscated or complex code structure and multiple network requests with minimal error handling increase suspicion. Overall, the script is designed for malicious data collection and exfiltration, fitting typical stealer behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a malicious credential and data stealer that targets browsers, Discord, wallets, and other applications. It collects sensitive information, decrypts data, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads. Its behaviors, including dynamic module installation, process killing, extensive data collection, and data exfiltration, confirm malicious intent.",
