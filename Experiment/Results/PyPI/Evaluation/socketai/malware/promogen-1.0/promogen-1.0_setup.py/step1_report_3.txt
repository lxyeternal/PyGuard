{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, applications, and files, then exfiltrate it via Discord webhooks and file upload services, potentially for malicious exploitation or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from browser storage files, login databases, cookies, local state files, and user directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include requests to external URLs (webhooks, file uploads), reading local files, and executing system commands (taskkill, shell commands). Data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, and files are sent over network or saved to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources (local browser/storage files, user directories, input logs) flow into decryption routines, token validation, and then into exfiltration functions that send data to external endpoints (webhooks, file hosting services). There are multiple threads gathering tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, which are subsequently uploaded or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, extensive use of obfuscated/deceptive variable names, and functions performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. It also kills processes and zips files, indicating potential sabotage or tampering. The code installs dependencies silently, which could be malicious. There are numerous instances of non-essential imports and redundant code, typical of obfuscated or malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a data stealer by extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications. It decrypts encrypted data using system APIs, gathers user information, and exfiltrates this data via Discord webhook and anonymous file hosts. It uses threading for concurrency, indicating an intent to maximize data collection speed. The presence of hardcoded webhook, process termination commands, and file zipping for exfiltration are suspicious. Overall, it is designed for covert data theft with malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including unauthorized data harvesting, credential theft, and exfiltration to external servers. It is highly suspicious, deliberately obfuscated, and clearly intended for malicious use, thus posing a severe security threat.",
