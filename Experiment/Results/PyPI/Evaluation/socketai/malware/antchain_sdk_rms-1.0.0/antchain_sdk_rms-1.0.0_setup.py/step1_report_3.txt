{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines package installation behavior and includes a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Requests to external server 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with collected system information.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomInstall.run() method collects system info and transmits it to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system details and transmits them to an external server during package installation without any user consent or notification. The URL used appears suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior is unusual for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setuptools installation process with a custom command that, upon execution, gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL. This activity resembles data exfiltration or tracking behavior often associated with malicious or privacy-invasive practices. The URL 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' is suspicious and may be used for command-and-control or data collection. The code does not appear to have any legitimate purpose related to the package setup process, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to an external server during installation, potentially compromising user privacy and security. This is indicative of malicious activity embedded within a package's setup process.",
