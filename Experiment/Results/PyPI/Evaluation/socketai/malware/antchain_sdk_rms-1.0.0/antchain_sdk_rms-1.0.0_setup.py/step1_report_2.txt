  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and customize installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered from socket, os, and getpass modules, then transmitted via requests.get to the specified URL during install.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hidden network request that collects system info without user consent, which is unusual for a setup script. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and unrelated to the package purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and other modules, then defines a custom install class overriding the run method. In this method, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via requests.get. This behavior is hidden within the install process and not documented or disclosed, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of a suspicious domain (ceye.io) for exfiltration further raises concern. The package setup itself appears normal, but the embedded network activity during installation is malicious or at least invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The intent seems to be collecting system info covertly, which is suspicious and potentially harmful. The package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
