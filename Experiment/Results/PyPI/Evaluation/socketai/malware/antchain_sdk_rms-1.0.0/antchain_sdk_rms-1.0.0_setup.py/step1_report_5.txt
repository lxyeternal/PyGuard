  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external server, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "Data from system info variables (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the URL request, sending potentially sensitive data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation with system information, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No authorization or user notification is present. Hardcoded URL used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom install command that extends the standard install process. During execution, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then makes a GET request to an external URL, passing this data as URL parameters. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not perform any other malicious actions, but embedding such network activity during package installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. The URL used ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io') suggests it is for data collection or testing. No other malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information during package installation without user consent. This pattern resembles a supply chain attack or data exfiltration tactic. The behavior is suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
