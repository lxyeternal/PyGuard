  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information: hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('http://5r13v9.ceye.io'), which could potentially leak user/system information.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the requests.get call, sending data to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and transmits it to an external domain during package installation without user consent or notification. Use of hardcoded external URL and data exfiltration behavior are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers system data: hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after, it makes an HTTP request to an external server, transmitting this data. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or user fingerprinting, which is not typical for package setup scripts and indicates potentially malicious intent. No other suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation, indicative of malicious or privacy-invading activity. It does not appear to serve a legitimate setup purpose.",
