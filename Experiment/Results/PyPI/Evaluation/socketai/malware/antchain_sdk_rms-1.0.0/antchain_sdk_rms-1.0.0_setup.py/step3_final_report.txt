{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and transmits it to an external URL during package installation, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources and sent via HTTP GET request to the external URL during the install process",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; use of suspicious external URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection and transmits it to an external server during setup, which is abnormal and indicative of malicious intent. The URL used is known for data collection/testing, and the activity occurs covertly during installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration tactics. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified given the active, covert data transmission. The activity could facilitate privacy invasion, data theft, or supply chain attacks. No false assumptions are evident; the behavior is suspicious and warrants high severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious activity by exfiltrating system information during package installation. The behavior is consistent with a supply chain attack or malicious tracking. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The code should be flagged for further review or removal to prevent potential privacy violations or security breaches.",
