  "purpose": "Define and install a Python package with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname, current working directory, and username from environment and system calls.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, collects hostname, cwd, and username, then sends data via HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of code that transmits system data to an external server during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command. When installed, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of merely installing the package, it makes a GET request to a specific URL, passing this data as parameters. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes, especially given the external URL and the collection of system details. The code does not sanitize or verify the URL, and the data transmission occurs unconditionally during installation, which is suspicious. The URL used appears to be a placeholder for an external data collection or command and control server.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unusual and potentially malicious action by collecting and transmitting system information during package installation. This behavior could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration, indicating a security risk.",
