  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; exception classes are only definitions without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for various custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations. There are no input reading, data processing, or output mechanisms. The classes are simple inheritance structures without any methods or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger project and serves as error handling infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present. It appears legitimate and standard for exception handling.",
