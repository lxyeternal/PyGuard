  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines exception classes and does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present, as this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions to handle SOCKS proxy-related errors. These classes are empty, serving as specific exception types for use elsewhere in the application. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic, nor any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The structure is standard and simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security risks present. It appears to be standard, benign code intended to organize error handling in a larger proxy-related system.",
