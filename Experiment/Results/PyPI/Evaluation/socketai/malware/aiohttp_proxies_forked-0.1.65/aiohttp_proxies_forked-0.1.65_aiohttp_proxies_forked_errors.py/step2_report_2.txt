  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only consists of custom exception class definitions.\n- No data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code is straightforward, inheriting from built-in exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.\n- Analysis: Correctly states the code is only class definitions, no malicious intent.\n- Score justification: Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- Purpose: Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- Analysis: Correctly identifies the code as simple class inheritance without malicious activity.\n- Scores: Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n### Report 3\n- Purpose: Define exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- Analysis: Appropriately notes the code is only class declarations, no malicious code.\n- Scores: Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- Purpose: Define exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior, straightforward class hierarchy.\n- Scores: Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- Purpose: Define exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.\n- Analysis: No issues, purely class definitions.\n- Scores: Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports are accurate; the code contains only class definitions.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0; no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Any recommendations for score adjustments?**  \nNo. All scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**  \nThe reports assume no malicious intent based solely on static class definitions. This is valid; there's no evidence of malicious behavior in such code.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical error handling component with no security concerns.",
