  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, or network interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is standard, straightforward, and appears to serve as error categorization.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets match the descriptions; they are just class declarations inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0, matching the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, and the code's purpose is purely for error handling.\n- The reports do not suggest any hidden or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
