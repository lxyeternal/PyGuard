{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class definitions and exception inheritance",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely class declarations",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; only exception class hierarchy setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors and related issues. These classes inherit from built-in exception types and do not include any operational code, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger application’s error handling module, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign component used for structured error reporting.",
