{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that are not reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; these are purely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, network operations, or external communications. The classes serve as error indicators for a SOCKS proxy implementation. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
