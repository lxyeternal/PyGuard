{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling, network operations, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code solely declares exception classes without runtime execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard exception class definitions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of custom exception class declarations for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exception classes. No functions, data handling, or network interactions are present. The class hierarchy appears straightforward and typical for error handling in network-related Python modules. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity are observed. The code is simple, well-structured, and intended solely for error categorization.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines standard custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger network proxy module.",
