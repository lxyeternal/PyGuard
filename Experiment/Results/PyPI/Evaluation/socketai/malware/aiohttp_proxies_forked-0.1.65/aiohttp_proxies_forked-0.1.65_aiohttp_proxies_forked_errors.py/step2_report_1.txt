  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of operational code, data processing, network interactions, or external data handling. The classes inherit from standard exceptions and contain no methods or dynamic logic. Therefore, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n   - **Confidence:** All are at 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no operational or network behavior, **a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified**. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Additional comments:\n\nGiven the totality of the reports and the code, I agree with the assessments. The code is a standard set of exception class definitions, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**In conclusion, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided.",
