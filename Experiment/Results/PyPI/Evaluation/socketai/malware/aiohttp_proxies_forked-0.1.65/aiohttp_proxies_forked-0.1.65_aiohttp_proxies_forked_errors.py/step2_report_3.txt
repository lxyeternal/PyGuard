  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No external data, network operations, or runtime logic are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger error handling module, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are all 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The overall analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in each report are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
