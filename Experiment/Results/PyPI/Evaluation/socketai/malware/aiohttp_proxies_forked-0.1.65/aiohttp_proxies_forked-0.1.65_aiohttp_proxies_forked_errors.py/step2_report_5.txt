  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionality.\n   - The code does not read external data, perform network operations, or contain any executable logic beyond class declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the code justify a higher risk score; the code is purely definitional with no operational or malicious components.\n   - The scores reflect a low security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is correct.\n   - No evidence of backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they carefully state that the code is benign and part of error handling infrastructure.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.",
