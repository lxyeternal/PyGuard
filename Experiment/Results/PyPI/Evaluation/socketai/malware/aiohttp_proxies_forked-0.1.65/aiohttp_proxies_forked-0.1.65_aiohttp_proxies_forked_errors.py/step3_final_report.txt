{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, no data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code is purely definitional.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no operational or network activities, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the static, simple structure. No issues or potential vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
