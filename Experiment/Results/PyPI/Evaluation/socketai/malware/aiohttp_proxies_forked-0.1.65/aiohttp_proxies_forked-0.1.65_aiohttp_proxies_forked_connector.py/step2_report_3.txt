  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or overestimations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages proxy configurations with no signs of malicious behavior. It constructs URLs and creates socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The use of external helpers is typical, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes proxy handling with standard practices, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code constructs proxy URLs, uses socket wrappers, and manages connections securely. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy resolution and connection setup, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's use of a NoResolver class and URL handling appears standard. No backdoors or data leaks are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — fitting.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describing proxy handling with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code constructs proxy URLs, manages socket connections, and uses standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the optional custom DNS resolver and socket handling, noting potential misuse if inputs are malicious but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's use of a custom resolver and socket wrapper is standard for advanced proxy configurations. While external inputs should be validated, nothing in the code indicates malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's evaluation is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify the code as standard proxy handling logic with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, risk:** All are appropriately low (0 or 0.2). The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** Since the code handles proxy URLs and socket creation, a risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to external input handling.\n\n- **Potential overestimation:** No. The reports do not overstate risks; they correctly note that proper validation is necessary but find no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
