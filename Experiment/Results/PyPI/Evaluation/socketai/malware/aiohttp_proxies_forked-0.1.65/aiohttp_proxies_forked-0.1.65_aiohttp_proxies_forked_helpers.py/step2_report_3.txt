  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard functions: parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections via asyncio.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network addresses are present.\n- The code relies on user-supplied inputs (proxy URLs, host, port), which is normal but can be exploited if malicious URLs are provided.\n- The functions validate input parameters and handle exceptions appropriately.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear; standard proxy connection management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through socket creation and connection.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious activity. The confidence score is high (0.95), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices and validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- Same general findings; standard proxy handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- Slightly higher confidence (1.0), but still no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- Notes that malicious proxy URLs could be used to exploit the system but emphasizes that the code itself is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.3, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n- The code's design allows external inputs (proxy URLs) to influence behavior. If an attacker supplies a malicious proxy URL, the code could connect to malicious proxies or leak data through misconfigured proxies.\n- However, the code itself does not perform malicious actions; it simply facilitates proxy connections.\n- The security risk is higher here (0.3) because of potential external misuse, but the code's logic remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 to 0.3). The higher value in report 5 is justified due to external input reliance.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The main security concern is the potential misuse of proxy URLs supplied by untrusted sources, which the code does not inherently prevent. This is reflected in the slightly higher security risk score in report 5.\n- No modifications are necessary for the scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My Own Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard risk for handling external inputs, slightly higher when inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections in an asyncio environment. Its security posture is acceptable, with the main caveat being the trustworthiness of external proxy URLs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with minimal security risks primarily stemming from external input trust, not from the code itself.",
