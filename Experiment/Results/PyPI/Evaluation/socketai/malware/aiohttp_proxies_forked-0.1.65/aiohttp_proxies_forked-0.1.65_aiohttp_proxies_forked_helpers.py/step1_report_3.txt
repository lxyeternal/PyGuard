  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for creating and managing proxy connections over SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing socket connections with asyncio.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() reads and parses proxy URLs; open_connection() and create_connection() read host, port, and proxy URL parameters; user-supplied proxy URL strings.",
  "sinks": "create_socket_wrapper() creates proxy socket objects; asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection() establish network connections using the socket objects.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters -> parse_proxy_url() extracts proxy details -> create_socket_wrapper() creates proxy socket -> connect() on socket -> network connection established via asyncio.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code observed. Proxy credentials are passed explicitly and not stored insecurely. No hidden backdoors or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection handling: parsing URLs, creating proxy sockets, and establishing network connections asynchronously. It validates input parameters, manages proxies via user-supplied URLs, and integrates with asyncio's event loop. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network communication. Usage of existing libraries and straightforward parameter handling suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections with asyncio. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected, and the code adheres to standard practices for proxy handling.",
