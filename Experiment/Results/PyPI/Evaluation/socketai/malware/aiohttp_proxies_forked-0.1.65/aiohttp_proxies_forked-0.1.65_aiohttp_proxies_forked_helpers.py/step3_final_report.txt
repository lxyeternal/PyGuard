{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously using asyncio, including parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url; host and port parameters in open_connection and create_connection functions.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment in sock.connect() and asyncio.open_connection() / loop.create_connection().",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or host/port flows through parse_proxy_url or direct parameters, leading to socket wrapper creation, connection via sock.connect(), and finally data transfer or connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network addresses detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections with proper input validation, exception handling, and use of external libraries. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The proxy URL parsing correctly unquotes credentials, and the connection functions enforce SOCKS proxies only. No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's potential for misuse depends on external inputs (proxy URLs), but this is typical for such utilities. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and security risk score remains low (~0.2), reflecting external misuse potential but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy management in asyncio environments. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
