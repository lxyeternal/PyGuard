  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections using asyncio.\n- It parses proxy URLs, creates socket wrappers, and establishes connections.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network addresses are present.\n- The functions validate inputs and handle errors appropriately.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and appears to be a typical network utility module.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- No malicious behavior or malware.\n- The code is legitimate.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- The score for malware is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk is low, considering the code handles proxy connections securely but could be misused if proxy URLs are malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1.\n- No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the previous report.\n- The reasoning is valid.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Same as above.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No issues found.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- The scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is solid.\n- The security risk is very low, which makes sense given the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Highlights that malicious proxy URLs could be used maliciously, but the code itself is standard.\n- No inherent malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly states that the code facilitates connecting to potentially malicious proxies but does not contain malicious code itself.\n- The security risk score is slightly higher (0.3) to reflect external misuse potential, which is reasonable.\n- Malware score remains at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- The reasoning is accurate.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence of malware or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Scores assigned in all reports:** Consistent and justified.\n- **Potential external misuse:** Noted but not inherent to the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all assessments, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varies but remains low, reflecting the potential for misuse via malicious proxy URLs but not due to code flaws.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are reasonable.\n- The code is a legitimate utility for managing SOCKS proxy connections.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- External factors (e.g., malicious proxy URLs) could pose risks but are outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                  | ~0.2       |\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the detailed analysis above.",
