{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections, specifically for SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and symbols from internal package files: connector, errors, helpers, and proto.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no complex data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious variable usage is observed.",
  "analysis": "This module functions as a typical package initialization or API export file, importing classes and functions from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use. It does not contain any runtime logic, data processing, or network communication that could be malicious. The presence of standard error classes and helpers related to proxy connections suggests normal functionality. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code structure is clear, straightforward, and consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code solely serves as an API interface for proxy-related functionalities without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
