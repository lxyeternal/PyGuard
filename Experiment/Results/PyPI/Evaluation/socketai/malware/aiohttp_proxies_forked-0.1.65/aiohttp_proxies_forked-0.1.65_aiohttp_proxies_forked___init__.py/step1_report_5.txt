{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy client, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is written to external sources or systems. No network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports symbols; there are no data flows or untrusted data handling visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets metadata (__version__), imports classes, functions, and error definitions from local modules, and defines __all__ for export. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization script, with no user input processing, network operations, or security-sensitive logic.\n\nThere are no sources of untrusted data, sinks where data could leak, or flows indicating data processing beyond module imports and exports. It does not include any logic that could be malicious or maliciously altered.\n\nThe code's structure and content are typical for a Python package module focused on SOCKS proxy functionality. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer for a SOCKS proxy package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as an interface layer, exporting relevant classes and functions. Overall, it appears safe.",
