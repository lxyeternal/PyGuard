  "purpose": "Module setup and export of proxy-related classes, functions, and error definitions for a SOCKS proxy package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules to module namespace; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py-like module that imports and exposes classes, functions, and constants. It defines a version string and __all__ for public API. There are no runtime operations, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is standard for Python package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores. The code serves as an API surface for a SOCKS proxy library, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script for a SOCKS proxy package, with no malicious or security risk elements detected.",
