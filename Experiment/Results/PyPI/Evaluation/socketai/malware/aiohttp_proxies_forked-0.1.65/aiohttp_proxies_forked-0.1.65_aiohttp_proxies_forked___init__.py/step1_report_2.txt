{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to implementing a SOCKS proxy client or connector, providing error handling, connection creation, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network or data leaks directly evident in this fragment",
  "flows": "Imports suggest source-to-sink flow involves module functions/classes, but no data processing occurs in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns; standard module import structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes, functions, and constants from local modules. It defines a version string and exports symbols for external use. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no handling of untrusted input is present. The code appears to be boilerplate module setup, with no malicious behavior or security concerns evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy-related package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet.",
