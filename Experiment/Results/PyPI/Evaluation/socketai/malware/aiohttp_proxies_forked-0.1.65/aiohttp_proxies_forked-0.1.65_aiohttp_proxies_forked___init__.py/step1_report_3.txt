{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to implementing proxy connections, possibly for network communication or anonymization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious actions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code mainly imports components and defines module exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures detected. The code only imports and exposes functions/classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from internal modules, and defines package metadata such as version and exported symbols. There are no data input sources, no untrusted data handling, no execution of dynamic code, nor any network operations, cryptographic functions, or system modifications within this snippet. It appears to be standard module setup code without malicious intent. The presence of multiple error classes and helper functions suggests modular design for a proxy-related library, but nothing indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy-related Python package. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code’s intent appears to be purely functional and benign.",
