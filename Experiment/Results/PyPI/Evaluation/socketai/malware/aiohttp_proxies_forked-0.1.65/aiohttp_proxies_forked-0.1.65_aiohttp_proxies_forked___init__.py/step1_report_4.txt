{
  "purpose": "This module appears to provide an interface for establishing and handling proxy connections, including error handling and helper functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions related to proxy connection handling and errors, but does not read input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines and exports classes, functions, and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns. It only sets up imports and module exports. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from local modules related to proxy connections and errors, and then defines module version and exports. It does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data, or perform network actions. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module. No malicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a proxy connection package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be safe and non-malicious.",
