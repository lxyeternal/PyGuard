{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to establish proxy connections asynchronously in Python, with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and data received from socket connections during negotiation and data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to remote SOCKS proxy servers and the proxy responses are received and processed; socket connections are established and closed.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials, connection requests) flows through the negotiation and connection methods, with data sent via _send and _receive functions; socket connections are established to proxy servers and destination hosts.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard proxy negotiation procedures, with no hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation; no malicious or suspicious logic is evident. The code performs typical network operations for proxy connections.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard patterns for asynchronous proxy client implementations. It handles address resolution, proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection management systematically. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or secret communication channels. The usage of socket and asyncio APIs appears consistent with typical network proxy clients. No suspicious or malicious code snippets, such as covert data leaks or system manipulation, are present. The code relies on proper exception handling for connection failures and proxy errors, with no hardcoded credentials or external secret handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to expected behaviors for such functionality, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
