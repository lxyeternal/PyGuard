{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames and ports for destination and proxy server, as well as optional user credentials for SOCKS5 authentication.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket operations such as sock_sendall and sock_recv, and data encoding for network transmission. No data leakage or untrusted data handling beyond expected network communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows through address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation functions, leading to socket data transmission over the network. No suspicious data flows are detected outside normal operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code performs standard SOCKS proxy handshake and connection procedures. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are apparent. Error handling is standard and appropriate. No external or hidden network connections are initiated without explicit function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, with methods for address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It manages network I/O with asyncio's loop methods, includes error handling for typical network errors, and performs standard protocol handshakes. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden network activity is present. All data processing follows protocol specifications, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication. It does not contain malicious behaviors or supply chain sabotage. It performs expected protocol operations securely and transparently. No security risks or malware indications are detected based on this analysis.",
