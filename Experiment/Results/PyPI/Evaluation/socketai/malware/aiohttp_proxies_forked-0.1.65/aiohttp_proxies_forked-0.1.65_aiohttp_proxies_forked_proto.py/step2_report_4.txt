  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with proper handling, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems somewhat conservative given the functionality; proxy code can be exploited if misused, but no direct vulnerabilities are evident.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- Obfuscated=0 is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, with emphasis on standard patterns, no malicious activity, proper exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The low risk score is appropriate, considering the code's purpose.\n- Malware=0 is justified.\n- Obfuscated=0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior, proper handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical proxy client; no signs of malicious activity.\n- Risk score of 0.2 is acceptable; proxy code can be misused but no specific vulnerabilities are evident here.\n- Malware=0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code appears legitimate.\n- The risk score is reasonable; proxy code can be misused but no direct issues.\n- Malware=0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious behavior, proper protocol handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The low risk score reflects the code's benign nature.\n- Malware=0 is justified.\n- Obfuscated=0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), generally conservative but acceptable, considering that proxy code can be misused if embedded maliciously in supply chains, but no such activity is detected here.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of proxy code, a slightly higher score (around 0.2) could be justified, but 0.1-0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (a conservative but reasonable estimate considering potential misuse)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is a standard, benign implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent or behaviors.",
