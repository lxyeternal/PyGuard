{
  "purpose": "Implement SOCKS proxy connection wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing asynchronous socket connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Reading proxy configuration parameters, hostnames, ports, user credentials, and resolving host addresses via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Sending constructed SOCKS protocol requests, receiving server responses, establishing socket connections, and performing address resolution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into protocol negotiation functions which send requests to proxy servers and receive responses, ultimately establishing a proxied socket connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of socket and asyncio libraries is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed. No network connections outside standard SOCKS proxy protocol are initiated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. It handles address resolution, proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection establishment following established protocols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be designed solely for proxy connectivity with proper error handling. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected. Usage of socket and asyncio is appropriate and typical for this functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation without malicious intent. It correctly follows SOCKS protocols, handles errors, and performs expected tasks without suspicious activities or backdoors. No security risks are evident from this code segment.",
