{
  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers supporting asynchronous socket connections, including authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames and ports for destination and proxy servers; address resolution via getaddrinfo; authentication credentials for SOCKS5.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows through socket send/receive methods; potential for data leakage if credentials or sensitive info are mishandled, but none are hardcoded or exposed.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hostnames, ports, credentials) are resolved and sent through socket connections; data flows from input to network sockets during negotiation and data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external communications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with proper error handling, address resolution, and authentication. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The socket operations follow best practices for asynchronous programming. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical proxy client risks. The high confidence score (around 0.9-1.0) is supported by the thorough review and adherence to protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
