  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are mentioned.\n- The code performs typical network operations, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.\n- The malware scores are uniformly zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears to be free of malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets or external malicious communications are evident.\n- The functions and flows follow standard SOCKS protocol procedures.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The code's logic and reasoning are sound.\n- The only minor concern is that the `connect()` method creates a socket but does not explicitly close it if an exception occurs outside the `close()` method, but this is a standard pattern and not critical.\n- The exception handling is appropriate, including for `asyncio.CancelledError`.\n- No evident errors or flaws in the logic.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to the code's nature and lack of hardcoded secrets.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-1.0) are justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on code review.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.\n- The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to network code, but negligible)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, open-source-like implementation of SOCKS proxies, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the minimal inherent risk of network proxy code, especially when it handles credentials securely and does not contain hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware or malicious intent detected. The low security risk score is appropriate.",
