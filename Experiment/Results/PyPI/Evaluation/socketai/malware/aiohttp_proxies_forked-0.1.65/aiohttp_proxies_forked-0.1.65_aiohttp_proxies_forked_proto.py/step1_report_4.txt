  "purpose": "Implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for network communication with optional authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reading from socket (sock_recv, sock_sendall), address resolution via getaddrinfo, input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and request data.",
  "sinks": "Sending and receiving data over network sockets, processing untrusted host and port data, and handling proxy server responses.",
  "flows": "Input host/port → address resolution or IP parsing → proxy connection request → proxy server response processing → establishment of proxy connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected; code is consistent with proxy connection handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It performs standard network operations such as socket creation, data transmission, and address resolution using getaddrinfo. Error handling is present for common connection and protocol errors. No signs of data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious backdoors are evident. The code follows typical patterns for proxy connection setup, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The dependencies and functions are related to network proxy handling, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers intended for network proxying. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It functions as expected for proxy connection management, with appropriate error handling and standard procedures.",
