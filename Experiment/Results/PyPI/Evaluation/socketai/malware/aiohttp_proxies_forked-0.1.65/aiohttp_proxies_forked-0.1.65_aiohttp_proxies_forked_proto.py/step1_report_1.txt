{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling proxy connections with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include input addresses, hostnames, and user credentials; uses socket and asyncio methods to receive data, resolve addresses, and handle connections.",
  "sinks": "Sends connection requests, authentication data, and address information; potentially exposes credentials through memory or network if misused.",
  "flows": "Input addresses and credentials (sources) are used in socket connection and authentication requests (sinks); flows include address resolution and proxy negotiation processes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications detected. Code uses standard libraries and patterns for network connections. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with proper exception handling, address resolution, and authentication flow. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoor activities. It properly manages socket connections and handles typical proxy negotiation steps. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external malicious communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected. It performs expected operations for proxy communication, and there are no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
