  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores across all reports are generally appropriate and aligned with the provided analysis. The only notable adjustment is reducing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0.1 to better reflect the lack of concrete malicious indicators. Overall, the code appears benign with minimal risk, and the current scoring system effectively captures the low threat level."
