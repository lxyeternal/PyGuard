  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger point to a likely malicious payload or backdoor. The scores in the reports are appropriate; an upward adjustment of malware score to 0.85 is justified. This package should be treated as malicious until further static analysis confirms benign behavior."
