  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malicious potential; Report 2 indicates notable suspicious activity justifying higher scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary. The analysis supports a cautious approach, emphasizing the need for further dynamic or static analysis for suspicious cases."
