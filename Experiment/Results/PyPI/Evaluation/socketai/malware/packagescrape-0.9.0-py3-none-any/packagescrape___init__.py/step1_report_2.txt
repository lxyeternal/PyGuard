{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a remote executable, then check for Java installation and if present, download and set up a JAR file in the startup directory.",
  "sources": "URL requests to https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/neu2.exe and https://kekw.battleb0t.xyz/dcbot",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded files with subprocess.call, running 'java -jar' on downloaded JAR, reading environment variable APPDATA",
  "flows": "Download 'neu2.exe' from URL -> Save to APPDATA -> Execute 'neu2.exe' -> Check for Java version -> If Java found, download 'dcbot.jar' -> Save to Startup folder -> Execute JAR in Startup folder",
  "anomalies": "Download and execute of an external executable from an untrusted URL, saving a JAR file to the Startup folder for persistence, conditional download based on Java presence, no verification of downloaded files",
  "analysis": "The script first downloads an executable from a remote URL, saves it to the user's APPDATA directory, and executes it. It then checks if Java is installed by running 'java -version'. If Java is detected, it downloads another payload (a JAR file) and saves it in the Startup folder, setting it to run at user login. This behavior indicates an attempt to persist and execute potentially malicious payloads, especially given the use of external URLs, execution of downloaded files, and saving in the Startup directory for persistence. The code does not perform any validation or verification of the downloaded files, raising significant security concerns. These actions collectively suggest malicious intent to persist, potentially control, or exfiltrate data from the infected system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including remote payload download, persistent setup via the Startup folder, and execution of downloaded files. These actions strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at control or compromise of the host system.",
