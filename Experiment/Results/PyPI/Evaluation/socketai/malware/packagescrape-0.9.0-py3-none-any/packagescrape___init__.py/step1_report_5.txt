  "anomalies": [
    "Downloading and executing an executable from an untrusted external source",
    "Writing a file into the Startup folder to ensure persistence",
    "Conditional download and execution based on presence of Java, which may be used to hide malicious activity",
    "No validation or integrity checks on downloaded files",
    "Use of hardcoded URLs for payloads"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious external URL and immediately executes it, which could be malicious. It then checks if Java is installed; if so, it downloads a JAR file into the user's Startup folder, likely for persistence and stealth. Both downloads occur without validation, and the use of the Startup folder for the JAR suggests an intent to maintain persistence. The script does not perform any integrity checks or user prompts, and it dynamically executes downloaded content, increasing the risk of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including untrusted code execution, persistence mechanisms, and downloads from unverified sources. It strongly indicates malicious intent and should be considered highly dangerous.",
