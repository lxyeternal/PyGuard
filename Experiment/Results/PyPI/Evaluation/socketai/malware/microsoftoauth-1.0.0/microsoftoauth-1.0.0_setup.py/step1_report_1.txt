  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'microsoftoauth' with basic metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Defines static variables for version, description, author info, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. Use of non-ASCII characters in author name and email appears intentional or possibly typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports setup utilities, defines metadata, and calls setup() with static parameters. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators are present. The author information contains non-standard characters, which might be a typo or stylistic choice but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
