  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'microsoftoauth'.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and uses no dynamic input, external data, or obfuscated code.\n- The author name and email contain non-ASCII characters, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of code injection, malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code matches the description and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks:** All reports agree on malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.\n- **Anomalies:** Non-ASCII characters in author info are noted but not suspicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard setup script.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0 across reports, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is static, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior, the malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese match the consensus in the reports and are justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, benign setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be adjusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The confidence remains high at 1.",
