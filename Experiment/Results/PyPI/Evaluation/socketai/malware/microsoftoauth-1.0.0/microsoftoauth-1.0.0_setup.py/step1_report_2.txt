  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'microsoftoauth'.",
  "sources": "User-defined variables (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), setup() function parameters, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious effects; no data output, network connections, or file manipulations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply defines package metadata and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; author email contains non-ASCII characters which might be unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines basic package metadata, and calls setup() with standard arguments. No inputs from external sources are processed dynamically, and no code execution or data handling occurs that could be malicious. The email address contains non-standard characters, which is unusual but not malicious. No embedded code, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign and typical setup configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
