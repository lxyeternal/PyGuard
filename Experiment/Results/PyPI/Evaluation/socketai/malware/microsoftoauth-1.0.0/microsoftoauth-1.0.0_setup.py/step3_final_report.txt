  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version, description, author info, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data used directly in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Author name and email contain non-ASCII characters, which are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It does not include dynamic code, external data handling, code injection, obfuscation, or network activity. The non-ASCII characters in author name and email are noted but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The non-ASCII characters are likely typos or stylistic choices. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
