  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the 'microsoftoauth' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static variables for version, description, and author info; the setup() function call with package details.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; setup() parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond author info; no unusual or suspicious code structures; no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines static metadata variables, and calls setup() with fixed values. The author email and name appear legitimate but contain non-standard characters. There are no code injections, external data reads, or malicious constructs. The code strictly performs package configuration without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It is a standard package configuration file.",
