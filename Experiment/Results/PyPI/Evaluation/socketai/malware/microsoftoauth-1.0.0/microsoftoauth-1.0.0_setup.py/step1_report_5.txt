  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for packaging a Python project named 'microsoftoauth'.",
  "sources": "Constants for version, description, long description; user inputs are not present; package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behavior; author name contains non-ASCII characters but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not read external input, handle untrusted data, or perform any actions that could be malicious. The use of constants and static package configuration is typical. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a normal setup configuration for packaging a Python module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
