  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python module. It defines metadata such as name, version, author, and description, and specifies dependencies and classifiers. No input reading, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious functions or behaviors are present. The author email uses non-ASCII characters, but that alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a benign packaging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
