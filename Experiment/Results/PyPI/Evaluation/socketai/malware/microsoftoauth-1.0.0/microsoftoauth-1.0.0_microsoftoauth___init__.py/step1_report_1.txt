{
  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a specified URL and execute it from the user's AppData directory.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe' and environment variable 'APPDATA'.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to a file in AppData, executing the downloaded file via subprocess.call.",
  "flows": "Input from the URL flows into writing an executable file in the user's AppData folder, then flows into executing that file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from an untrusted, potentially malicious domain and executing it without verification. The use of 'start' via subprocess.call may be an attempt to run potentially malicious code silently.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves data from a specified URL and saves it as an executable in the user's AppData folder within 'Microsoft'. It then executes this file without any verification or user prompt. The domain hosting the executable appears suspicious, and the code performs actions typical of malware: downloading and executing remote code locally. The use of environment variables for path construction and direct execution indicates a potential malicious intent. There are no obvious checks, error handling, or validation steps, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malware: downloading an executable from a suspicious domain and executing it without user consent or validation. This pattern suggests malicious intent and poses significant security risks.",
