{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an executable file from a remote URL, then run it locally.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe' used to fetch data; environment variable 'APPDATA' used to determine save location.",
  "sinks": "The 'subprocess.call' command executes the downloaded file, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "urllib.request.urlopen reads data from remote server -> data is written to a file in the APPDATA/Microsoft directory -> subprocess.call executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading an executable from an untrusted URL and executing it without validation; use of 'start' with subprocess for execution; saving to APPDATA/Microsoft suggests potential persistence attempt.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a remote server and saves it in a common application data directory, then executes it. The URL points to an external server, which is suspicious. The execution of the downloaded file without verification poses security risks. The approach indicates potential malicious intent, such as distributing malware. The use of subprocess.call with 'start' indicates an attempt to run the executable asynchronously, which is typical of malicious scripts attempting to persist or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, as it downloads and executes an external executable without validation, indicating malicious intent likely aimed at installing malware or establishing persistence. The overall security risk is high.",
