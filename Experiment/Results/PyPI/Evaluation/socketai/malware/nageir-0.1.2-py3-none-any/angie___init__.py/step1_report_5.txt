  "purpose": "The code imports the 'angie' module, likely to utilize its functionality within a larger application.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present within this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from a simple import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an import statement; there are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports the 'angie' module, which is a standard Python import statement. Without additional context or code, there's no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. The module 'angie' itself could be benign or malicious, but that cannot be determined from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with minimal information to suggest any issues.",
