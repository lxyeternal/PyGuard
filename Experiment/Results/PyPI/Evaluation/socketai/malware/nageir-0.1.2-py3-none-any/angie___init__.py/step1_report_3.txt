  "purpose": "The code imports the 'angie' module, likely to use its functionality within the script.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'angie' module from the environment or installed packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment, as it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'angie'. Without additional context or code, it's not possible to determine if 'angie' is malicious or contains malicious behavior. The import alone is benign, but further inspection of the 'angie' package itself would be required to assess security risks. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities are apparent from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, further analysis of the 'angie' package is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.",
