  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports are based solely on a single import statement: `import angie`. There is no additional code, data flow, or behavior to evaluate. The import statement itself is benign syntax in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports correctly identify that, from the provided code snippet, no malicious activity or security risk can be determined. They appropriately note the lack of data flows, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. They also mention that the module 'angie' is not a standard library, which warrants further investigation, but this is outside the scope of the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the evidence.\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2. Given the lack of context, these are low, which seems appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting uncertainty due to minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the limited evidence. No reason exists to elevate the risk scores without further context.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the evidence. If the package 'angie' were malicious, that would require additional context or code, which is absent here.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims**  \nThe reports correctly avoid assumptions about the package's maliciousness. They note that 'angie' is not a standard library, which is a valid point, but they do not speculate further.\n\n7. **Score Consistency and Reasonableness**  \nScores are consistent with the minimal evidence. Given the lack of code behavior, the low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain very low, around 0.1 or less, since there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided code snippet, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk**. The import statement alone is benign. The main concern is the unknown nature of the 'angie' package, which warrants further investigation if more code or context becomes available.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal risk due to unknown package source)\n\n**Final note:** Without additional code or context, no further security issues can be identified.",
