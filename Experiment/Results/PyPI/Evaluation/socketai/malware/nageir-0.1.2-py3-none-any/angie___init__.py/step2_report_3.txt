  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports are based on a single import statement: `import angie`. There is no additional code, data flow, or suspicious activity described. The import statement itself is benign syntax.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports generally correctly state that the import alone does not indicate malicious behavior.  \n- They note that 'angie' is not a standard library, which warrants further investigation, but they do not assume maliciousness solely based on that.  \n- No report claims the code is malicious; they all assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the minimal code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of evidence.  \n- **SecurityRisk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the minimal context.  \n- **Confidence:** Varies between 0.3 and 0.4, reflecting uncertainty due to lack of context.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \n- No reason to assign higher risk scores since no suspicious activity, data flow, or malicious code is identified.  \n- The only potential concern is the package name 'angie', which is uncommon, but that alone doesn't warrant increased risk scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports appropriately avoid assuming maliciousness solely based on the import.  \n- They suggest further investigation of the 'angie' package, which is prudent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \n- All scores are consistent with the minimal code and cautious analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero due to the unknown nature of 'angie', but still very low.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- If I had to assign a personal estimate based on the minimal information, I would keep the malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at around 0.1.  \n- The key unknown is the 'angie' package itself, which warrants further inspection outside this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed unless more context is provided.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, but flag the 'angie' package for further review to determine its trustworthiness.",
