  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the minimal code context and the details provided.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports focus solely on a single import statement: `import angie`.\n- No additional code, data flows, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The 'angie' package is not a standard Python library, which warrants verification, but on its own, an import statement is benign.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the minimal code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are moderate to low, reflecting the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues Reported\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no apparent malicious activity. No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n  No logical flaws are evident. The reports appropriately state that further context is needed to assess the security implications of the 'angie' package.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code. The security risk scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.2, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports\n\n- **Is the 'angie' package suspicious?**  \n  The reports mention that 'angie' is not a standard library, which is true. This warrants caution, but without further information, it cannot be deemed malicious. The reports correctly note that the import alone does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  Some reports suggest that 'angie' could be malicious or suspicious based solely on its name or the fact that it's not standard. While vigilance is good, these are assumptions; actual malicious activity cannot be inferred from an import statement alone.\n\n- **Obfuscation and malware scores:**  \n  All are 0, which aligns with the code snippet. No obfuscated code or malware activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations for Score Adjustments\n\n- **Security risk scores:**  \n  Given the minimal code, scores of 0 or 0.2 are appropriate. No adjustments needed unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly set at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Additional Comments\n\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly emphasizing that the import alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- The main concern is verifying the 'angie' package's source and contents, which cannot be done from this snippet.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are detectable here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment and Estimated Scores\n\nBased on the analysis, my own estimates are:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to unknown package, but no concrete evidence)\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The code snippet is benign as it only contains an import statement.\n- The suspicion around 'angie' is unsubstantiated without further context.\n- Scores are appropriate; no significant changes are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** For a thorough security assessment, examining the 'angie' package's source or behavior would be essential.",
