{
  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing the 'angie' package in Python code, focusing on potential malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import angie' as the sole code element, which reads the 'angie' package/module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any use of the 'angie' package's functions or data flows, but none are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or function calls are present; the code only imports the package without further actions.",
  "anomalies": "The package 'angie' is not a standard library, which warrants further investigation, but no anomalies or suspicious code are visible in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is benign in isolation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are observable. The package 'angie' is non-standard, so its trustworthiness cannot be determined from this snippet alone. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), acknowledging the unknown package but no active threats. Confidence in this assessment is moderate due to minimal context. The main concern is verifying the package's source and contents outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'angie' package, which requires further investigation. Scores are appropriate given the minimal code and lack of evidence.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
