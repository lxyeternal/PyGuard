{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'angie' module, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it only imports a module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink or vulnerable operation observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with no further logic. The module 'angie' is not a standard Python library, which warrants verification, but on its own, this is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'angie'. Without additional context, this does not indicate malicious behavior. The module could be benign or malicious depending on its content; however, the code provided does not include any execution or data handling. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs. The import statement alone is low risk but warrants further investigation if 'angie' is an unknown or suspicious package.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import statement itself is benign; further analysis of the 'angie' package would be needed to assess its security profile.",
