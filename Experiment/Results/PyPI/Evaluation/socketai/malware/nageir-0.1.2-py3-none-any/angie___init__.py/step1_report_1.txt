  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sink identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be established from source to sink due to minimal code context.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code provided; the import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'angie' package. Without further code, no data input, output, or suspicious behavior can be identified. The imported package itself could be benign or malicious, but this cannot be determined from the import alone. No anomalies or unusual code features are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The package 'angie' appears to be imported normally. Additional context or code would be necessary for a thorough security assessment.",
