{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'angie' library/module, likely to use its functionality within the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself does not read untrusted input or data; it loads a module from the environment or installed packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as executing untrusted data or network operations are present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this single import statement; it only loads a module.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'angie' is uncommon and could potentially be malicious or disguised; without further context or code, this is suspicious but not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement. It does not perform any operations or contain any obvious malicious behavior. The only concern is the module name, which could be benign or malicious depending on its contents and source. Without additional code or context, it is impossible to determine if this is malicious. The import itself is standard Python syntax and does not execute untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement. There is no evident malicious activity or security risk based solely on this line. However, the module name 'angie' warrants caution if its origin is unverified or if the module's contents are malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
