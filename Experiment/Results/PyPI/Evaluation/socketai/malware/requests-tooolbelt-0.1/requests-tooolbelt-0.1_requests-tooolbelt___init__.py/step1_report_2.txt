{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a basic HTTP server that serves static files and handles specific GET requests, possibly for a web application or API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from incoming HTTP requests, such as URL paths and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can influence file serving logic, directory access, or output responses; also, potential for code injection if inputs are not sanitized before being used in system commands or responses.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests (URLs, parameters) flows into decision logic that determines which files to serve or responses to generate. If inputs are used insecurely, they could lead to directory traversal or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code does not seem to perform any suspicious activities such as network exfiltration, code execution, or data theft. The code structure appears standard for a basic HTTP server.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an HTTP server, listening on a specified port, and serves static files based on request URLs. It uses standard libraries and contains no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The code handles requests and outputs responses without apparent security flaws, assuming no unsanitized input is used in a dangerous manner. No suspicious external connections or payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an HTTP server for static content. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks based on the provided snippet. The overall security risk is low, with a confidence score of 0.9 due to the limited scope of analysis and absence of complex features.",
