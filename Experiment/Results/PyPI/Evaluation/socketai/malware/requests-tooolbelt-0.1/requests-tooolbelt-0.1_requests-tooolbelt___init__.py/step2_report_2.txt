  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, accuracy, and proper risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Not provided; code is unavailable.  \n- **Analysis:** The reviewer notes no malicious patterns or anomalies, but the actual code isn't present.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n  - confidence: 0.5\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSince there's no code, the conclusion that there's no malicious behavior is reasonable, but the low confidence reflects the limited information. The security risk score is low but not zero, which seems acceptable given the lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Basic HTTP server serving static files, handling GET requests.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, standard library use, no obfuscation, and no suspicious external connections.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe assessment appears sound. Serving static files via a basic HTTP server is typical, and no signs of malicious activity are present. The high confidence score aligns with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Not explicitly stated; possibly data processing or network communication.  \n- **Analysis:** No clear malicious patterns, but code is missing, making the review limited.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n  - confidence: 0.5\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven the lack of actual code, the cautious approach is justified. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The confidence reflects the limited data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Data processing or similar; no suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion seems reasonable. The code appears benign, and the high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility or data processing; no specific context.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no eval/exec, no obfuscation, standard libraries.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2  \n  - confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe detailed reasoning supports the scores. The code appears benign, and the high confidence score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with their analyses.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation evidence.\n- **Security risk scores:** Uniformly 0.2, which is conservative but acceptable given the limited scope and lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Confidence scores:** Appropriately high where code is available and detailed, lower where code is missing.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimation:**\n\nGiven the summaries and the assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, but conservative, considering incomplete information)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 to 0.9 (high where code is available and reviewed thoroughly)\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe scores assigned in each report are consistent with their reasoning. No adjustments are necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
