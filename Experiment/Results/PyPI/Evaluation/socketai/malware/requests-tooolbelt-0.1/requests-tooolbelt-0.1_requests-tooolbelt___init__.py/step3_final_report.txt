  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external modules, request data, environment inputs, environment variables, user inputs, network communication points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file system access, environment variables, dynamic execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks include environment variables, request data, environment inputs, and potential dynamic execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "Limited code information; all reports correctly identify the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. High confidence in benign assessment where code is reviewed thoroughly; moderate confidence where code is absent. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage found.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the limited scope. Unless specific code containing 'exec' or 'eval' is present, the current assessment remains valid.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
