  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and malicious potential through the execution of an encoded PowerShell command during package setup. The activity is suspicious and likely malicious, warranting high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a slight emphasis on the high risk posed by stealthy, obfuscated code execution. Overall, this package should be flagged for further review or removal from distribution channels."
