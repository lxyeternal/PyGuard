{
  "purpose": "The source code installs dependencies silently, copies cryptographic libraries, decrypts and executes encrypted payloads, downloads remote scripts, and sets up persistence via startup folder, all employing obfuscation techniques indicative of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APPDATA), system directories for Python and cryptodome libraries, network response from https://kekwltd.ru/run.py, and user startup folder for persistence.",
  "sinks": "exec() on decrypted payload, subprocess.Popen() for code execution, file writes to startup folder, and system attribute modification to hide files.",
  "flows": "Code installs dependencies -> copies cryptodome libraries -> decrypts and executes payload via exec() -> downloads remote script -> saves to startup folder -> hides file -> executes remote script at startup.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payloads decrypted at runtime and executed via exec(), silent package installation, copying cryptodome to Crypto directory, remote script fetched from suspicious domain, and hiding files with 'attrib +h'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: silent dependency installation, cryptodome library copying, decryption and execution of encrypted payloads, remote script download from a suspicious URL, persistence setup via copying scripts into startup folder and hiding them, and stealthy process creation. The use of Fernet encryption and dynamic execution indicates obfuscation. The remote URL and persistence mechanisms are typical malware indicators. The code's behavior is consistent with malware, with high confidence that it is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, exhibiting typical malware behaviors such as remote code execution, persistence, obfuscation, and stealth. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1.",
