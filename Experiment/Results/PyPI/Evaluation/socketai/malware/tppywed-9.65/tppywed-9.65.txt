      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed stealthily during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and reference to a suspicious URL suggest a significant security threat, likely a supply chain attack vector. The scores assigned (malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, risk ~0.85) are justified. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until verified."
