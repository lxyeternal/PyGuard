  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'pyzelf' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ path, reading README.md, importing and decoding base64 data, executing decoded code.",
  "sinks": "exec() of decoded base64 string, print statements during install.",
  "flows": "Import __file__, read README.md, decode base64, execute decoded code during install, run setup with package details.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and execution during the install process, which is unusual and suspicious; the decoded code appears to import 'os', 'subprocess', and executes complex base64-encoded payloads, indicating potential malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and pathlib modules. It reads its own file path and attempts to read a README.md file for a long description. The key suspicious activity is in the InstallCommand class, where during run(), it executes a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, imports 'os' and 'subprocess' and appears to perform dynamic code execution. This is a common technique for obfuscation and malicious payload delivery. The presence of exec() with decoded code suggests malicious intent, potentially to run arbitrary code during installation. The setup() call is standard but integrates this suspicious install command. Overall, the code contains obfuscated malicious payload execution during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes obfuscated malicious code that executes during installation, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. The code's behavior suggests it may execute arbitrary, potentially harmful commands on the host system. The use of base64 decoding and exec() during setup is suspicious and likely malicious.",
