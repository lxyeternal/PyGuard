  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() with dynamically decoded code, which is suspicious and often used to hide malicious activities.",
    "Embedding obfuscated code in base64, a common technique to conceal malicious payloads.",
    "The code in the base64 string appears complex and intentionally obscured, indicating potential malicious intent.",
    "Lack of explicit documentation or comments explaining the purpose of the embedded code."
  ],
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard packaging modules, defines metadata, and includes a custom install command that overrides the run method. During execution, it attempts to decode a base64-encoded string and execute it via exec(). The decoded code is highly obfuscated, which is a red flag for malicious activity, as it prevents easy inspection and understanding. Such techniques are often used to hide malicious payloads like data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network requests. The script also reads a README file for description, but this appears standard. The suspicious activity is confined within the exec() call with obfuscated code, which indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious payloads executed during installation via exec(). The use of base64 encoding and dynamic code execution suggests intent to conceal malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high due to this concealed code execution, which could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
