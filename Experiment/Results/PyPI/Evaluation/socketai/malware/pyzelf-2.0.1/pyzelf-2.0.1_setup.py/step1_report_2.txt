{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package named 'pyzelf' with version 2.0.1, including reading the README.md for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; executing code decoded from base64 string within the InstallCommand.run method.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes code decoded from base64, which may execute malicious code; other potential data leaks are not evident.",
  "flows": "The base64-decoded code executed in exec() runs during installation, potentially leading to malicious actions, including network activity or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed during installation; the code is intentionally obfuscated via base64 encoding and exec().",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools for packaging, then defines a custom install command that overrides the run() method. Inside run(), it attempts to decode a base64 string and execute the resulting code. The decoded code appears to import 'os' and 'subprocess', then executes a complex command that involves launching scripts, possibly related to system or network operations. The code's obfuscation via base64 and dynamic execution is suspicious. This pattern is often used to hide malicious payloads during package installation. The rest of the setup script appears normal, with no other suspicious activity. The use of 'exec' on decoded code is a major indicator of potentially malicious intent, as it could run arbitrary code on the user's system.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that is decoded and executed during installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior could allow malicious actions such as remote code execution, system modification, or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high due to this obfuscated execution pattern.",
