  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pyzelf', with an obfuscated code execution embedded.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading 'README.md', executing obfuscated code via exec() and base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decoded base64 code; potential for arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' and package info -> execution of decoded base64 payload via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code injected via base64 decoding and exec(), which is unusual in standard setup scripts. Hardcoded base64 payload with malicious-looking code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading description files and setting package info. However, it contains an obfuscated segment that decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec(). The payload appears to import modules, decode further base64 strings, and run code, which is suspicious. This behavior indicates intentional concealment of malicious code execution during installation. The use of try/except around the exec() suppresses errors, making detection harder. Overall, the code is attempting to hide malicious activity under the guise of a setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious obfuscated code executed during package installation, representing a high security risk. The obfuscation and hidden exec() indicate an attempt to run arbitrary code, possibly harmful. This package should be considered unsafe for use.",
