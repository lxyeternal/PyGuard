  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pyzelf' with an embedded obfuscated payload executed during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated code inside the InstallCommand.run() method, which is executed via exec() after decoding from base64.",
  "sinks": "The exec() call with decoded code, which may execute malicious Python code, possibly leading to system compromise or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes, decodes the base64 string, and runs the resulting code via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow that can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated base64-encoded code executed at install time, which is unusual and suspicious. The code is hidden, and the purpose is not clear from the package setup details.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup. Inside the custom InstallCommand, it attempts to run a try-except block where it decodes a base64 string and executes it dynamically. The base64 string, once decoded, likely contains malicious code, as indicated by obfuscation and the pattern of execution via exec(). The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious behavior. The obfuscated code could be malicious payload executed during installation, possibly to perform unauthorized actions or establish backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded obfuscated code that is decoded and executed during installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and could be malicious, indicating potential supply chain attack or malicious intent. The package should not be installed or distributed without further investigation.",
