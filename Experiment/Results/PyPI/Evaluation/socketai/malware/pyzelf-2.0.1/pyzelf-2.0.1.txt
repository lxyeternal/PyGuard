      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious payloads executed during package installation, representing a high security risk. The use of base64 encoding and exec() indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the package should be considered malicious until further deobfuscation confirms benign intent."
