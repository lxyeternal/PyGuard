  "purpose": "A simple static print statement intended to prompt the user for contact or activation.",
  "sources": "No external input, data fetching, or dynamic code execution; static string in print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or effects from this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and clear with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with a static message. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, noting the absence of inputs, dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The message appears to be a placeholder or licensing prompt, not malicious. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
