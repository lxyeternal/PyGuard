{
  "purpose": "The code prints a message prompting the user to contact R for activation.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not present; no external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the print statement outputting a message to the console.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The message references 'R' in a context that might suggest a placeholder or an incomplete instruction. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement displaying a static message. It contains no input handling, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The message seems to be a simple notification or instruction, possibly part of a larger activation process, but by itself, it shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs a simple print operation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
