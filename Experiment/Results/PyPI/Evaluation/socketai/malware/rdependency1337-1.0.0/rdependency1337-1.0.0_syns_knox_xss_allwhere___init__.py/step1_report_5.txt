  "purpose": "Prints a message prompting the user to contact 'R' for activation.",
  "sources": "The 'print' function reads no external input; it simply outputs a static string.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs to the console, which is generally harmless.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static string is directly printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded message appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single print statement with a static string. No input sources, no data processing, no external dependencies or network activity. The message suggests a prompt for contact or activation, possibly for licensing, but on its own, it does not contain malicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply printing a static message with no malicious intent or security risks.",
