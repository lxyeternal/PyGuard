{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes custom installation behavior, including potentially malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), username via getpass.getuser(), and executing a system command to modify authorized_keys.",
  "sinks": "Requests to an external URL with collected system information, system command that appends a public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, username -> stored in a dictionary -> sent via HTTP GET request; system command modifies authorized_keys with a hardcoded SSH key.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a hardcoded SSH public key being appended to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and exfiltration of system information to an external server without user consent. The request to an external server occurs during installation, which is unusual. The use of socket, os, getpass, and requests for data collection and exfiltration indicates suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during execution, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then executes a system command to append a hardcoded SSH key to the user's authorized_keys file, potentially creating a backdoor. Simultaneously, it sends system information to an external URL, which suggests data exfiltration. These actions are embedded in the install process, which is unusual for a legitimate setup script and indicates malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. No obfuscation is present, but the behavior itself is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script demonstrates malicious intent by exfiltrating system information and modifying SSH authorized_keys to potentially facilitate unauthorized access. These behaviors are not typical for legitimate package setup scripts, indicating a high risk of malicious activity.",
