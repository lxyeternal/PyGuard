{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package and executes custom post-installation actions that collect system information and potentially exfiltrate it.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket (hostname), os (current working directory), getpass (username), and executes system commands to modify SSH authorized keys.",
  "sinks": "The system executes a system command to append a public SSH key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and sends collected data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request.",
  "flows": "The data collected (hostname, cwd, username) flows from sources to the request parameter and the system command, which modifies SSH authorized keys. The data is also sent externally via requests.get.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes hardcoded SSH public key being appended to authorized_keys and sending system information to a remote URL without any obvious user consent or legitimate purpose. The code does not sanitize or validate data, and uses os.system with a fixed string that contains a public key, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon running, collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then executes a system command to append a hardcoded SSH public key to the authorized_keys file, potentially granting persistent remote access. Additionally, it sends collected system data to an external server via an HTTP request, possibly for tracking or exfiltration. These actions are embedded within a setup.py file, which is typically not used for such behaviors, indicating malicious intent. The code does not appear obfuscated but performs covert data collection and privilege escalation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information, modifying SSH authorized keys to potentially allow remote access, and exfiltrating data to an external server. These actions are highly suspicious and suggest an attempt at unauthorized remote control or data theft embedded within a seemingly normal setup script.",
