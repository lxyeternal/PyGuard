{
  "purpose": "The script modifies the installation process to execute code that collects system information and potentially maliciously exfiltrates it.",
  "sources": "Code reads hostname (socket.gethostname), current working directory (os.getcwd), and current user (getpass.getuser). It also executes a system command to append an SSH public key to authorized_keys.",
  "sinks": "Requests are sent to an external server with collected system data. The os.system call executes a command that writes an SSH key to authorized_keys, potentially granting unauthorized SSH access.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. The system command (os.system) is executed immediately after data collection, modifying SSH configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded SSH public key being added to authorized_keys, which could allow remote access. The code runs during the installation process, executing system commands and network requests without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and external. The code uses obfuscated variable names and minimal comments, which can hinder analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard installation process with a custom run method that performs several malicious actions. It gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then exfiltrates this data to an external server via a GET request. Simultaneously, it appends a hardcoded SSH public key to the authorized_keys file, potentially allowing unauthorized SSH access. The use of socket, getpass, os, and requests is standard, but the combination and purpose are suspicious. The code executes during setup, which is unconventional for benign packages. The external URL is a known OAST (Oastify) domain used for testing or malicious purposes. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior intended to compromise system security and exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: data exfiltration to an external server and installation of a backdoor SSH key. It executes during package setup, which is highly suspicious. The obfuscated style and hardcoded key further suggest malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
