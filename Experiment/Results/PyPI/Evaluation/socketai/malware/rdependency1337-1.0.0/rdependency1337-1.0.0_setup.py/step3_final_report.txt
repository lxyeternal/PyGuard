{
  "purpose": "The code performs malicious actions during package installation, including adding a hardcoded SSH backdoor key and exfiltrating system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "os.system() writing to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, requests.get() transmitting data to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> data sent via requests.get(), system command appending SSH key",
  "anomalies": "Execution during setup.py installation, hardcoded SSH key, data exfiltration to suspicious URL, minimal obfuscation but unusual variable naming",
  "analysis": "The code collects system info, appends a static SSH public key to authorized_keys, and exfiltrates data to an external URL during installation. These actions are clearly malicious, providing persistent backdoor access and data theft. The code is straightforward with minimal obfuscation, and the external URL is suspicious. The malware score should be set to 1 due to explicit malicious actions. The obfuscation score is low (around 0.2) as the code is not heavily obfuscated. The security risk score should be maximum (1) because of the severe threat posed by backdoor installation and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing backdoor setup and data exfiltration during package installation. It poses a high security threat and should be flagged for removal. The scores are consistent with the observed behavior, with malware and risk scores at 1, and a low obfuscation score around 0.2.",
