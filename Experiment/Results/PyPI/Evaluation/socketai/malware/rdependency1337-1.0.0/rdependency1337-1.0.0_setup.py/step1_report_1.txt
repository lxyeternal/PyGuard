{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package named 'rdependency1337' and includes a custom installation routine that executes additional commands during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(). It also executes system commands with os.system and makes an HTTP GET request with requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious sinks include the os.system call that appends a long SSH public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and the requests.get call that transmits collected system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then transmits this data via an HTTP request to an external server. Simultaneously, it executes a system command that writes a static SSH public key to the user's authorized_keys file.",
  "anomalies": "The code writes a hardcoded SSH public key to the user's authorized_keys file, which could be used to gain unauthorized access. The external request to an obscure URL with system info is suspicious. Use of socket and getpass to gather info during installation is unconventional. The code also includes an obfuscated or unstandardized style, with unusual variable naming and inline comments.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining a custom installation class. During the run method, it collects system data (hostname, cwd, username) and then writes a static SSH key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, potentially creating a backdoor. It also sends the collected system info to an external server via an HTTP GET request. The presence of hardcoded SSH keys and external data exfiltration indicates malicious intent. The code runs during package installation, which can be exploited to persist unauthorized access or collect sensitive data without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by adding a static SSH key to the authorized_keys file, enabling potential remote access, and exfiltrating system information to an external server. The installation process is manipulated to execute these actions, representing a severe security risk. Overall, the code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
