  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command triggered during package setup, indicating malicious or sabotage intent. The high obfuscation, error suppression, and remote execution potential justify maximum security concern. The package should be flagged for review, and the payload decoded for confirmation. Current scores (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are appropriate given the evidence."
