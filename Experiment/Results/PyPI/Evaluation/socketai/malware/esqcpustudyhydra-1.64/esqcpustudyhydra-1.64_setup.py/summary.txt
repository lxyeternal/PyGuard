  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, with error suppression. The high obfuscation and stealthy behavior justify high malware and risk scores. It should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further payload analysis."
