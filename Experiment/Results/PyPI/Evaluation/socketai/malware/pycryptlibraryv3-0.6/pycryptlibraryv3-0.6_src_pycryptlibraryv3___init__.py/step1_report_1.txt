{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive information from a Windows system, including cookies, passwords, browser data, system info, and tokens, then send the collected data to a remote server via webhook. It also performs malicious file collection, zipping, and uploading to external hosts, indicating intent to harvest user credentials and system data for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system info, browser files (Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), clipboard, running processes, registry keys, local files, and process lists.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs, uploads files to anonymous file hosts, and posts data to Discord webhook. Also kills certain processes and manipulates browser files.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser files, system commands, clipboard, and environment variables feed into decryption, data extraction, and collection functions; these data are then formatted and sent to external servers via HTTP requests, Discord webhooks, or uploaded files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, suspicious external URLs (prepaidroot.ru, paste.bingner.com), extensive use of system commands and registry access for system info and token extraction, malicious file collection, and process termination. Presence of obfuscated code structures, suspicious file and process handling, and data exfiltration routines indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains modules for stealing passwords from browsers, extracting cookies, system info, tokens, and clipboard data. It encrypts/decrypts data with Windows CryptUnprotectData, reads browser databases, registry keys, and local files. It collects system details, screenshots, and user tokens, then compresses and uploads this data externally. It also kills processes related to debugging tools and virtual machine detection. Hardcoded URLs and file paths are used to transmit data. The presence of multiple data exfiltration points, process termination routines, and external communication strongly suggest malicious behavior intended for data theft and system reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by performing extensive data harvesting of sensitive user information, system details, and browser data, then exfiltrating it to external servers. It employs evasion techniques such as process termination and process monitoring. The hardcoded URLs, data collection routines, and external uploads confirm malicious intent. Confidence in this conclusion is high due to clear indicators of theft and exfiltration activities.",
