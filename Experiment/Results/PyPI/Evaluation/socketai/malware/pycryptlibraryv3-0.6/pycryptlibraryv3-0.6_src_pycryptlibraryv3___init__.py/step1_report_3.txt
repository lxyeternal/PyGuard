{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious payload designed to steal sensitive user data, including browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, and wallet data, then exfiltrates this information via Discord webhook or uploads to file sharing services. It also attempts to disable security measures and persist on infected systems.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., COMPCOMPUTERNAME, APPDATA, TEMP), local files (browser data, cookies, history, credit cards, password databases), process enumeration, clipboard data, network requests to IP info and webhook URLs, user input, and registry entries.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to exfiltrate data (via HTTP POSTs, requests, urlopen), file writes for credentials, cookies, history, credit card info, password data, token validation, and zip file creation for data collection.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like browser data, environment variables, clipboard, and registry to sinks such as network exfiltration points and file storage, often after decrypting or extracting stored credentials and tokens. Multiple threads gather data simultaneously and upload or send it via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive hardcoded URLs (e.g., 'prepaidroot.ru', paste.bingner.com, transfer.sh), obfuscated or complex functions for decrypting browser data, multiple instances of code designed to kill processes (e.g., Chrome, Discord), deceptive comments, and use of obfuscated variable names. The code also forcibly kills processes like Chrome and Discord, disables security mechanisms, and disguises as legitimate system or browser data collection scripts. It uses aggressive threading and file manipulations for stealth.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with malicious network requests and environment data collection, then proceeds with extensive credential harvesting from various browsers, including decryption of stored passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and Discord tokens. It then compresses collected data into zip files and uploads them to external file sharing sites or sends them via webhooks. The code also includes mechanisms to disable security or monitoring tools by killing processes, deleting specific files, and modifying registry entries. It also attempts to persist on startup and hide its activities. Multiple threading modules accelerate data collection. The code includes multiple hardcoded URLs, suspicious process management, and obfuscation hints, all consistent with typical info-stealer/malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly malicious, designed for data theft, system sabotage, and stealthy exfiltration. It targets browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, and wallet data, exfiltrates via Discord webhook and file upload, disables security measures, and maintains persistence. The presence of hardcoded malicious URLs, process termination, data encryption/decryption, and extensive data collection strongly indicate malicious intent with high security risk.",
