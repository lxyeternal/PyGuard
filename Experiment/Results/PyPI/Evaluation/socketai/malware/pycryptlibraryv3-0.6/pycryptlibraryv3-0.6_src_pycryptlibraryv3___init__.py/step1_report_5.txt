{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious data exfiltration, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information from the user’s system. It also includes capabilities for gathering system info, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating files, likely for malicious surveillance and exploitation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (e.g., 'COMPUTERNAME', 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), local system files (browsers' 'Local State', 'Login Data', 'Cookies', 'History'), clipboard data, and user input. It also reads from various browser profile directories, registry keys, and specific files such as 'Local State' and database files for cookies and passwords.",
  "sinks": "The code posts data to external URLs (notably 'https://prepaidroot.ru/relay') via HTTP POST requests, uploads files via 'transfer.sh', and exfiltrates sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, credit card info, and system info. It also kills security or debugging processes, and executes commands that kill processes like 'chrome.exe'.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and clipboard contents are collected from sources like browser databases, registry keys, environment variables, and clipboard. This data is stored temporarily, then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to remote servers. The code also zips collected data before sending, and uploads certain files to external file-sharing services.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, suspicious process termination commands for security tools, extensive use of obfuscation techniques (e.g., dynamic registry access, encrypted cookies), and unsolicited data exfiltration routines. It also contains fake error message boxes, disabling of debugging, and process termination based on system checks indicating VM or sandbox detection. The code’s structure is inconsistent, and variable names are misleading or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script is heavily oriented toward covert data theft and system reconnaissance. It gathers browser credentials, cookies, system identifiers, network info, and clipboard data. It exfiltrates this data via HTTP requests to suspicious domains, often after compressing files. The presence of process termination for debugging tools, checks for VM indicators, and disabling of certain security features indicate intent to avoid detection. The code’s structure is complex, and many functions work together to continuously monitor clipboard activity, collect stored credentials, and send data without user consent. The inclusion of extensive dependencies, obfuscated registry access, and hidden process termination routines suggest malicious intent aimed at stealthy system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It functions as a comprehensive information stealer, harvesting sensitive user data including cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and clipboard data, then exfiltrates it to a remote server. It also attempts to disable security measures and debug protections. The overall design and behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent for unauthorized data collection and system surveillance.",
