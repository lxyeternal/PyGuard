{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malicious info-stealer, exfiltrating cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and screenshots, then sending data via webhooks and uploading files to external hosts. It also terminates security and debugging processes, employs obfuscation, and maintains persistence.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser files (Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data), registry keys, clipboard content, process list, system info, and user tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to malicious URLs, Discord webhooks, file uploads to anonymous hosts like transfer.sh, and process termination routines.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser data, environment variables, clipboard, and system info are decrypted or read, then transmitted via HTTP requests or uploaded files, often after compression. Process termination routines are triggered to evade detection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs (prepaidroot.ru, bingner.com), obfuscated regex patterns, misleading variable names, extensive threading, and process-killing routines targeting security tools and virtual machine indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple stages of malicious activity: decrypting browser credentials, stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, system info, and screenshots; exfiltrating data via webhooks and file uploads; disabling security measures; and maintaining persistence. It employs obfuscation techniques such as misleading variable names, encrypted data, and complex routines. External URLs and process termination routines confirm malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior align with known info-stealer malware, indicating high severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for extensive data theft, system reconnaissance, and evasion. It exhibits moderate obfuscation and high security risk. The malware score is 1, obfuscation approximately 0.7, and overall security risk is 1.",
