{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal sensitive user data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency wallets, and then exfiltrate this data to remote servers controlled by the attacker.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., COMPUTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), clipboard data via pyperclip, local database files (Chrome, Firefox, other browsers), Windows registry (for Roblox cookies), and process lists (to kill specific processes). The code reads from browser storage, system files, and user input (clipboard).",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points include HTTP POST requests to specified webhook URLs, file uploads to transfer.sh, and zip file uploads. Sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, browser history, credit card info, and screenshots are written to local files and then uploaded or sent via network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (browser storage, clipboard, system info) through decryption and parsing functions, into data structures (cookies, passwords, tokens, system info), which are then compiled into reports and sent over network to remote URLs. Certain functions also terminate processes (e.g., Discord, monitoring tools), and modify browser or Discord configurations to disable protections.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive process termination (e.g., Discord and anti-debugging checks), obfuscated or misleading variable names, multiple self-extracting and self-deleting behaviors, attempt to disable security features, and collection of system info and browser data indicate malicious intent. Also, the code installs itself in startup folders, hides processes, and uploads data to external servers. The code uses obfuscated regex patterns, dynamic code execution, and attempts to disable debugging tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive credential stealer and system info extractor. It utilizes browser databases to extract cookies, passwords, history, credit cards, and extensions. It also extracts tokens from browser leveldb files and Firefox SQLite files. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs, retrieves system info, and captures screenshots. It terminates security-related processes and modifies configurations to disable protections. Data is compiled into formatted reports and uploaded to remote servers via webhook or file hosting services. The code is designed to operate stealthily by hiding processes, disabling security measures, and running at startup. The overall design indicates intent to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and crypto wallets while avoiding detection and deleting traces.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It acts as a credential and data-stealing trojan targeting browsers, system information, and crypto wallets. It exfiltrates data to attacker-controlled servers, disables security processes, and attempts to evade detection. The code is structured for covert operation with obfuscation, persistence, and data exfiltration features, confirming high malicious intent.",
