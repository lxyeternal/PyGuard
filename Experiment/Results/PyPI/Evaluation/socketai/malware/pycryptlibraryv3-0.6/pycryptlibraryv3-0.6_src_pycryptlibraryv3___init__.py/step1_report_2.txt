  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for malicious data theft and system surveillance. It collects user information, browser data, cookies, passwords, tokens, and screenshots, then exfiltrates this data via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, browser files (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), clipboard, running processes, system information, network info, and screenshots.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent to external URLs via HTTP POST requests, including Discord webhooks and file uploads to external services. It also executes system commands and kills security or monitoring processes.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser files, environment variables, clipboard, and system info are read and processed; decrypted data is then sent over network requests to specified webhooks or external file hosts. Some functions also modify browser files or kill processes to disable detection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include extensive use of system command execution, process termination, clipboard manipulation, decryption of stored credentials, data exfiltration via webhooks, file zipping and uploading, and use of obscure or obfuscated variable names. Presence of hardcoded URLs, suspicious regex patterns, and process checks for virtual machine indicators suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive data stealer, collecting system info, passwords, cookies, browser history, credit card info, tokens, and screenshots. It decrypts stored browser credentials using master keys and system APIs, then consolidates and uploads the data. The code manipulates clipboard content to replace cryptocurrency addresses and monitors running processes to terminate security tools. It also creates zip archives of stolen data and uploads them to external servers. The presence of process checks for virtual machine indicators suggests anti-analysis measures. The code's structure, including extensive threading, data encryption handling, and hardcoded URLs, confirms malicious intent, with high potential for privacy violations and system compromise.",
