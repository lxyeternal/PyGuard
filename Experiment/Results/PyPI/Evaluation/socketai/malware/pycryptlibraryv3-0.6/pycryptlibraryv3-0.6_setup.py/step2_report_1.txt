  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The original code is straightforward, importing setuptools and calling setup() with static metadata, and using find_packages('src').\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports uniformly assert that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Given the code provided, these assessments are accurate. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These are appropriate, considering the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, no justification is needed for higher scores. The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the static nature of the code, which is appropriate. No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no dynamic code, no external data processing, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All indicators point to a benign configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No security concerns are present in this setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is legitimate and safe.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
