{
  "purpose": "To configure and package a Python library named 'pycryptlibraryv3' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, license, author info, URL, keywords) and locates packages in the 'src' directory using find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the setup script primarily defines static metadata and package discovery.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling in this script.",
  "anomalies": "The script appears standard with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The URL points to a GitHub repository that appears legitimate; no hidden or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, uses setup() to define package metadata and source directory, and calls find_packages('src') for package inclusion. There are no user inputs, environmental variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network communication, credential handling, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign, standard package setup code.",
