  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup(), find_packages('src') for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external input, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. It uses find_packages('src') for package discovery, which is a common practice. No dynamic code, environment variables, or external data processing are involved. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a legitimate, benign package configuration file with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
