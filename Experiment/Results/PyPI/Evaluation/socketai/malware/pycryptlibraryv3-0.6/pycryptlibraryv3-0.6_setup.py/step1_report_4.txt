{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of the 'pycryptlibraryv3' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script solely sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward setup configuration with no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata such as name, version, license, author info, and packaging directories. It uses find_packages to locate packages in the 'src' directory and specifies URL and keywords. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard setup.py for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only defines how to build and distribute a Python package. No malicious or security concerns are present.",
