  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'gptplus' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, package metadata fields, dependencies ('requests'), and URL fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially vulnerable points; no code execution or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flows; the code solely initializes package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URLs pointing to Google and Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up' in 'url' and 'project_urls'—likely humorous but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script with no obfuscated or malicious code. All reports are empty ('Empty response'), providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The URLs are unconventional but benign. The package dependencies and structure are standard. No suspicious logic, code injection, or data leaks are present. Given the lack of detailed reports, the overall security risk and malware likelihood are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign, with no detectable malicious activity or security issues based on the provided code and reports. The URLs are unconventional but not malicious. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting no risks or malware.",
