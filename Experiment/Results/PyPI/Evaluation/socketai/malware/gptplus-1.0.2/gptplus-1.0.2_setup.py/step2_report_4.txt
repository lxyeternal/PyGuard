  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review**:\n   - The code appears to be a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n   - The package name, author, description, and URLs seem benign and generic.\n   - The `long_description` is read from `README.md`, which is typical.\n   - The dependencies and classifiers are standard.\n   - The URL and project URLs point to Google search links, which are unconventional but not malicious.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports contain \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - No specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are described.\n   - The absence of detailed report content makes it impossible to identify actual security concerns or code flaws.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no issues are reported, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - The empty responses suggest no detected malware or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The URLs are pointing to Google search results, which is unusual for project URLs but not inherently malicious.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0, no risks identified based on available data.\n\n**Summary**:\nGiven the lack of detailed report data, the code appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided information and the absence of any detected issues.",
