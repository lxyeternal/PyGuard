  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code and the reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code reads static files, extracts version info via regex, and passes data to setup().\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code adheres to common Python packaging practices.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior, straightforward version extraction, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Claim:** Standard setup script, no untrusted input, no suspicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Claim:** Typical setup, safe file reading, no dynamic code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Claim:** Standard package setup, no execution of untrusted code, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Claim:** Basic setup script, no network or dynamic code, uses outdated import but not malicious.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all zero.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is a straightforward setup script with no external or untrusted inputs, the overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script. No issues, no suspicious behavior, and the provided scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The overall security assessment should remain at zero risk, zero malware, and zero obfuscation.\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or dynamic behaviors, but based on the current static analysis, this code is safe.",
