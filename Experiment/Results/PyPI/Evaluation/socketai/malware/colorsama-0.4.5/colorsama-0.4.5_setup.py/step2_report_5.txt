  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code uses common patterns for reading files, extracting version info, and configuring package metadata.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected.\n- The code's purpose is solely to facilitate package installation/distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify the code's straightforward nature.\n- The scores assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-verification of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, matching the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Potential issues or discrepancies:\n\n- No issues detected in the code or reports.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The use of `from __future__ import with_statement` is outdated for Python 2.7+, but this is not malicious; it's just legacy code.\n- The code reads files and extracts version info safely.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are processed insecurely.\n- The code is typical for a setup script.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**            | **0**      |\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n## **Final recommendation:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.**",
