{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'colorsama' Python package, including version retrieval, package metadata, and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as '__init__.py' for version info, 'README.rst' for long description, and the current file path for directory context.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network, file, or system command executions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads package files to extract version info; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard setup pattern without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading files for metadata, extracting version info via regex, and configuring package parameters. It uses standard practices for Python package distribution. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. No external network calls, no credential handling, and no dynamic code evaluation or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and adheres to common setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, focusing solely on package configuration.",
