  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'colorsama', handling file reading, version extraction, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for version info, 'README.rst' for long description",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads, no untrusted data or external sinks involved",
  "flows": "Read files -> extract version via regex -> pass data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; outdated import but harmless",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static file reads and regex-based version extraction. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to common packaging practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected. The use of '__future__' import is outdated but not malicious. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",
