  "flows": "Colorama's Fore.GREEN/Fore.RED modify output streams; print statements send formatted messages to stdout and stderr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes color handling via colorama, and prints colored messages to stdout and stderr. No user input handling, network operations, or environment variable misuse observed. The purpose appears to be demonstrating terminal color output and stderr redirection, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for demonstrating color output and stderr redirection. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
