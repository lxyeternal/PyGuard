  "purpose": "Demonstrate colorama styling in terminal output using command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for color, background, style, and text input",
  "sinks": "Terminal output displaying styled text",
  "flows": "User input -> argparse parsing -> dynamic attribute access via module.__dict__ -> concatenation of style codes and text -> print to terminal",
  "anomalies": "Use of module.__dict__[item.upper()] for dynamic attribute access, controlled by argparse choices; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of colorama styling with command-line arguments. It uses argparse with choices to constrain inputs, mitigating risks associated with dynamic attribute access. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of __dict__ for attribute retrieval is safe here due to input constraints. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's behavior aligns with its purpose, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic attribute access is controlled and safe. The code is a simple, controlled demonstration of terminal styling using colorama. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
