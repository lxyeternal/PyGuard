  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic attribute access is controlled and safe. The code is a simple, controlled demonstration of terminal styling using colorama. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
