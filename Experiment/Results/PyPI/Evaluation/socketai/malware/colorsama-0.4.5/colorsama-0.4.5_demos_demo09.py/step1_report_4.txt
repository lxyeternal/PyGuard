  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of the colorama library for colored terminal output based on command line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments (args) for color, background, style, and text to display.",
  "sinks": "Prints formatted text to the terminal; no direct data leak or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Command line input -> argument parsing -> applying color/style -> output to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __dict__ to access module attributes dynamically; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes argument parsing, then defines functions to process module attribute names and retrieve attribute values. It dynamically accesses style, foreground, and background color codes via module dictionaries and applies them to display the provided text. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration without external data transmission or malicious behavior. It does not contain any obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or harmful instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign colorama demo script intended to show colored terminal output. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
