  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the usage of the colorama library to print styled colored text in the command line based on user-supplied arguments.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command line arguments (args.colour, args.background, args.style, args.text).",
  "sinks": "The final print statement outputs styled text to the console; no data leaks or external connections occur.",
  "flows": "Command line inputs are processed through argparse, mapped to colorama style codes, and then combined for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes argument parsing for styling options, validates user inputs against colorama's available styles, and then constructs a styled string for output. No external data is fetched or sent, and there are no indicators of malicious behavior. It functions solely as a demonstration of colorama styling capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script for styling terminal output using colorama. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It operates solely within standard library and colorama usage.",
