  "purpose": "Adjusts the Python import path to prioritize local source code for the 'colorama' module.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file (__file__), imports sys, os.path functions, and the current file's directory to modify sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path to influence module import behavior; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to determine current directory -> constructs path to parent directory -> inserts path at start of sys.path to affect module import order.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The path modification is a common pattern for local development or testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with a comment about licensing. It then imports necessary modules and manipulates sys.path to include the parent directory of the current file, likely to prioritize local module versions over installed packages. This is a typical setup in development or testing scenarios. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code simply adjusts the import path without executing untrusted code or accessing sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard practice for local module development and does not show any signs of malicious intent. The code's purpose is to ensure that local 'colorama' source code is used during import. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
