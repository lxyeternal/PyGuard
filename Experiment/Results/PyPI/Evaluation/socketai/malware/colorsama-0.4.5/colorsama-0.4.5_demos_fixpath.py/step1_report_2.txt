  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine current file location, accessing sys.path to modify module search paths.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path, which influences module import behavior.",
  "flows": "The code reads the file location (__file__) and then inserts a directory into sys.path to control module import order.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard technique to prioritize local module source.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license comment, then adds the parent directory of the current file to sys.path to ensure local 'colorama' source is imported over installed versions. It uses __file__ to determine the current file location, joins it with '..' to get the parent directory, normalizes the path, and inserts it at the start of sys.path. This is a common practice for local development or testing scenarios. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply manipulates the module search path to prioritize local source code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
