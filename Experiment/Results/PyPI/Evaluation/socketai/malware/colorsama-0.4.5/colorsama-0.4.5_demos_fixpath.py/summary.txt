  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for local development, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 (or very close to it). The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable given the context but is not necessary. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate."
