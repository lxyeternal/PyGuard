  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing text foreground, background, and style using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath module, and colorama library initialization.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting styled text to the terminal; no untrusted data or external input involved.",
  "flows": "Imports -> init() -> print statements with styled text outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and only demonstrates terminal styling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colorama, and then outputs styled text with different foreground, background, and style attributes. All operations are standard terminal styling functions without any data handling or external communications. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign demonstration of terminal styling using the colorama library. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. It is safe for use.",
