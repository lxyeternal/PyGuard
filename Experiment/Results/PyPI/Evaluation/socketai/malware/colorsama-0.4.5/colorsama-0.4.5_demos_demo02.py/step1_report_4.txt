  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing terminal text foreground, background, and style using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "import statements for user input and colorama library; no external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "print statements generating terminal output; no untrusted data or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static demonstration of terminal styling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of colorama features.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the colorama library and outputs styled text to the terminal, demonstrating foreground, background, and style changes. It does not read external input, handle sensitive data, or perform network or system modifications. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. All code appears to be a simple example for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script for terminal text styling using colorama. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
