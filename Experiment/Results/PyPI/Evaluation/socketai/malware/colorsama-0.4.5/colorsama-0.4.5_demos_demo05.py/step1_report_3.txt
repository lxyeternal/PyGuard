{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of the colorama library with different initialization options regarding ANSI wrapping on Windows and Unix systems.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, environment (via imported modules), and colorama functions",
  "sinks": "stdout (via print and AnsiToWin32), file parameter in print function",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., ANSI sequences) from colorama functions flows to stdout via print calls",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. The code simply uses colorama for colored output, no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colorama with default and modified wrap settings, and prints colored text to stdout using standard print functions and colorama's AnsiToWin32. All operations are straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity detected. The code is benign, focused on displaying color output behaviors across different systems.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign demonstration of the colorama library's initialization options. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
