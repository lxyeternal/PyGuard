  "purpose": "Demonstrate the difference between colorama initialized with wrapping on and off, showing ANSI handling on different platforms.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, AnsiToWin32(sys.stdout)",
  "sinks": "stdout via print, AnsiToWin32 writing to stdout",
  "flows": "print statements with color codes -> AnsiToWin32 -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard library usage, no obfuscation, no external input",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and colorama, initializes colorama multiple times with different configurations, and outputs colored text. It does not process untrusted input, perform network or file operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The use of AnsiToWin32 is appropriate for handling ANSI sequences on Windows. No suspicious patterns or security issues are present. The code's purpose is purely demonstrative, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly demonstrates colorama's ANSI handling features across platforms. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
