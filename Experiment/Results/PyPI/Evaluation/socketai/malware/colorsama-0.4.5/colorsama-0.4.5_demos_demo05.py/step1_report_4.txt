{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of colorama library's initialization options for ANSI escape code handling on different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard input, import statements, initialization functions, and print statements.",
  "sinks": "Outputting colored text to stdout, including using AnsiToWin32 to write ANSI sequences.",
  "flows": "Input/output flows involve reading code configuration and writing colored output; no untrusted external data sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes colorama with default and custom settings, and outputs colored text to demonstrate configuration effects. The use of AnsiToWin32 with the file parameter is standard for handling ANSI codes on Windows. No external data sources, user input, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a demonstrative purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for demonstration of colorama's ANSI handling features. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
