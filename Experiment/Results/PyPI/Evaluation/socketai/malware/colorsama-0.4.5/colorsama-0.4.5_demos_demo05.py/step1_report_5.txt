{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the usage of colorama's initialization with wrapping enabled and disabled for cross-platform ANSI support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, fixpath, colorama, and print statements that generate output.",
  "sinks": "Print statements and writing to sys.stdout via AnsiToWin32, which could potentially be manipulated if untrusted input was involved.",
  "flows": "Input sources are the import statements and sys.stdout; the output is generated via print and AnsiToWin32, which may process data for console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is purely demonstrative and does not perform any network or file system operations beyond standard output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and demonstrates color output formatting with colorama. It uses init() with different parameters to show wrapping behavior, and outputs colored text to stdout and via AnsiToWin32. No user input, untrusted data, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The purpose appears solely educational or demonstrative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely demonstrative of colorama's features, and does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
