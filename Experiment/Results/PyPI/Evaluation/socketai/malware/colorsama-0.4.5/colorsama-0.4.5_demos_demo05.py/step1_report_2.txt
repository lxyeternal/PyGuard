  "purpose": "Demonstrate how to initialize and use colorama with different wrapping options for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.stdout, and colorama initialization functions.",
  "sinks": "print function outputs, AnsiToWin32 output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama -> printing with colored text -> potential output via AnsiToWin32 (when wrap=False).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of colorama appears solely for terminal output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colorama with default settings, and outputs colored text to standard output. It also demonstrates changing the wrapping behavior with the 'init(wrap=False)' call, using AnsiToWin32 for unwrapped output. No external data input, environment variable manipulation, or unsafe operations are present. The use of colorama is consistent with its intended purpose for terminal coloring, and there are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of colorama's initialization and output formatting features. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
