The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 (or very close to it). The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable given the context but is not necessary. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate."

Scores for malware and obfuscation are 0; security risk is effectively 0, with a very minimal risk score of 0.1 being overly cautious but acceptable. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
