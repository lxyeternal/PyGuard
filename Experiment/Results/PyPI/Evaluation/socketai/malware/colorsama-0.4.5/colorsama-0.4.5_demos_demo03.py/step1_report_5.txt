  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama and fixpath, initializations of colorama settings.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Import and initialize colorama settings, then print formatted strings with color and style attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward terminal text formatting with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and uses colorama's init function with autoreset options set to true and false. It prints styled text to demonstrate terminal coloring behavior. There are no data inputs, external network interactions, or any security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be for illustrative or educational purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for demonstrating terminal color formatting features. It contains no malware, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
