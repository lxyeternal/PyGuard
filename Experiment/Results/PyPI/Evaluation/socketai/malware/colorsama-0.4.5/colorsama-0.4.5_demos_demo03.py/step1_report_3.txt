  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama library, reading environment when init() is called.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting colored text; no untrusted data sources or external input are used.",
  "flows": "Colorama's init() function sets terminal behavior; print statements output formatted text based on previous init() calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected; code uses standard library functions as intended.",
  "analysis": "The script imports colorama, initializes it with different autoreset settings, and prints colored text accordingly. It demonstrates expected behavior of colorama's formatting options without involving any external data, user input, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and intended solely for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, demonstrating terminal text formatting with the colorama library. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
