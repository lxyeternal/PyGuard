  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in coloring terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama, usage of init() function, and print statements with color formatting.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output colored text to the terminal.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama with autoreset set to True, followed by print statements; reinitialization with autoreset False, followed by additional print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, demonstrating expected colorama behavior without hiding or obfuscating code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports colorama and initializes it twice with different autoreset settings, then prints sample colored text. No external data inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution. The code's purpose appears to be educational. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is simple, clear, and intended for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of colorama's color and reset behavior in terminal output. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and is purely educational. No suspicious or malicious signals are present.",
