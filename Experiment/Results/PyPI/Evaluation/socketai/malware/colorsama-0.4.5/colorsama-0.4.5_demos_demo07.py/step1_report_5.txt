  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python",
  "sources": "Import statements (fixpath, colorama), user input (not present), print statements",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output control characters for cursor movement",
  "flows": "Print statements output cursor movement control sequences followed by characters, affecting terminal cursor position",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code only manipulates terminal cursor positioning",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama, then outputs text interleaved with terminal cursor control sequences to demonstrate movement. There are no external inputs or data flows involving untrusted data. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It solely manipulates terminal cursor positions for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a demonstration of terminal cursor control with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe.",
