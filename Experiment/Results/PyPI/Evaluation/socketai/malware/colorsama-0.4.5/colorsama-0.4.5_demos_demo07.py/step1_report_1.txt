  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python",
  "sources": "Standard input and data from the colorama.Cursor module",
  "sinks": "Standard output via print statements that include cursor movement control sequences",
  "flows": "Input data (print commands) includes cursor control sequences that alter terminal cursor position during output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of cursor movement sequences is standard for terminal UI control.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, then outputs several lines with cursor movement sequences embedded in print statements. The sequences manipulate cursor position on the terminal, but do not perform any network activity, file operations, or malicious system modifications. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior is present. The code's intent is to demonstrate cursor control, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor control using colorama. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.",
