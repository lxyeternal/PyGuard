  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from the print statements and imported libraries; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (console) using print statements and cursor movement commands.",
  "flows": "Code executes sequentially, initializing colorama, printing static strings, and performing cursor movement commands; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The cursor movements are for visual demonstration only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the colorama library and uses cursor control sequences to demonstrate relative cursor movements. It does not accept external input, modify files, or perform network operations. The cursor movement sequences are standard for terminal control and serve a display purpose. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple demonstration of terminal cursor movements using colorama without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
