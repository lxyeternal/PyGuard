  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using colorama library in Python",
  "sources": "Import statements (fixpath, colorama), and the print function",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output control characters for cursor movement and text",
  "flows": "Input from user is not directly used; data flows are limited to print outputs involving control characters",
  "anomalies": "Use of cursor control sequences may be intended for UI manipulation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colorama, and uses cursor control sequences to move around the terminal window, printing characters at specific positions. It appears to be a simple demonstration or visual effect. No data is transmitted, no external inputs are processed, and no suspicious behavior or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor movement using colorama. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
