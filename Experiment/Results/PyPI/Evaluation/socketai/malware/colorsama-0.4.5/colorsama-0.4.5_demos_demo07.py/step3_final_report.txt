  "purpose": "Demonstrate terminal cursor movement using colorama library for visual effect.",
  "sources": "Terminal input/output functions, colorama cursor control sequences",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and serves a visual purpose",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama, initializes it, and uses cursor movement sequences to manipulate terminal output for demonstration. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The cursor sequences are used solely for visual effect, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is simple, clear, and serves an educational purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The cursor control sequences are used for display purposes only. Scores for malware and obfuscation are 0; security risk is effectively 0, with a very minimal risk score of 0.1 being overly cautious but acceptable. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
