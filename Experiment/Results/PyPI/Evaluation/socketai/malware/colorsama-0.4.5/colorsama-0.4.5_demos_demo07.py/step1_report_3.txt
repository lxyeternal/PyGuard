  "purpose": "Demonstrates cursor relative movement using colorama for terminal control",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath, colorama, and calls to colorama.init() and print() functions",
  "sinks": "Uses print() with terminal cursor control sequences to manipulate output display",
  "flows": "Initialization via colorama.init() -> printing static strings -> cursor movement sequences through colorama.Cursor methods -> final output manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, initializes colorama for terminal control, and prints static strings with cursor movements. The cursor movement sequences are used to create a specific visual output on the terminal. There are no dynamic inputs, external network calls, or data leaks. The code's behavior is consistent with a visual demonstration. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal cursor manipulation demonstration using colorama. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
