{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling application information related to Discord, including AppInfo, PartialAppInfo, and AppInstallParams, with properties and methods for managing application metadata.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input payloads during class initialization, specifically from dictionaries such as 'data' and 'params'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data, system commands, network connections, or sensitive data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input payloads into class attributes during object instantiation; there are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data leading to security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily handles data encapsulation with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for Discord application information, involving safe data parsing, attribute setting, and asset retrieval via properties. It uses typical class structures, type annotations, and property methods. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or external malicious interactions. All data handling appears to be straightforward and based on external input data. The import statements, class design, and methods follow standard patterns without suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical, well-structured set of data models for managing application information within a Discord API context. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no network or system manipulations. Overall, the code appears safe and purely functional.",
