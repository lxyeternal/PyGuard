{
  "purpose": "The code models application information for a Discord SDK, initializing data from JSON payloads and providing properties to access assets and related info.",
  "sources": "Data is read from JSON payloads during object initialization, including fields like 'id', 'name', 'owner', 'icon', 'cover_image', and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network calls, or file writes occur; data is used internally within class attributes and properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payloads into class attributes; properties like 'icon' and 'cover_image' convert identifiers into Asset objects; no external sinks are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes for application info, partial info, and install parameters, primarily initializing from payloads. No network activity, code execution, or malicious patterns are present. Asset properties safely convert identifiers into Asset objects. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is evident. The structure aligns with standard SDK data models, and the absence of external side effects indicates a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of data models for Discord application info, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal exposure of URLs and IDs but does not indicate any actual security threat.",
