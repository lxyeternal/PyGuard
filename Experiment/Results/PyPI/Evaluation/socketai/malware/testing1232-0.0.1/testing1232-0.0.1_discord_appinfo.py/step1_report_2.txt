  "purpose": "This code defines classes and data structures for representing application information in a Discord-related library, including app details, partial info, and install parameters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input payloads such as AppInfoPayload, PartialAppInfoPayload, and InstallParamsPayload, provided during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not perform any network I/O, file operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payloads into class attributes, with no external data or untrusted sources processed beyond initial payloads. No external outputs or actions are performed based on this data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses standard data modeling and property accessors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data classes with attribute initialization from input payloads, including some property methods for assets and flags. It imports standard libraries and other internal modules without any suspicious code. There are no network operations, system commands, or obfuscated code. The overall structure and content are typical of SDK data models. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious data modeling implementation for Discord application info. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code is safe and serves its purpose within the library context.",
