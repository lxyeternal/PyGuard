  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes classes for app info, partial info, and install parameters, primarily initializing from JSON payloads. Data flows into attributes; properties convert icon and cover image identifiers into Asset objects.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is standard for SDK data models.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal (0.1). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on data modeling for application info. No external network or file operations.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No anomalies or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security issues. Confidence is very high (1.0).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Defines classes for app info, partial info, and install parameters, with safe property accessors. Data is sourced from payloads, with no external communication.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Standard data modeling, no security risks. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous reports, handling application info with safe data parsing.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns. Confidence is perfect (1.0).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Data models for application info, no external data sinks or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard implementation. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports describe standard data models for application info in a Discord SDK context.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None. No network activity, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low. The code only processes and exposes data, with no dangerous operations.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are zero, which aligns with the analysis. The risk scores are low, reflecting the non-malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain very low (~0.1 to 0.2), consistent with the current scores.\n- **Overall Security Posture:** The code is a standard, safe data model implementation with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured data model for Discord application info, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are appropriate and should not be increased.",
