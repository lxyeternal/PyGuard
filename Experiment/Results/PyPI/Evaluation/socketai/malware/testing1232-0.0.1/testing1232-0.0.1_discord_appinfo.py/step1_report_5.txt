{
  "purpose": "Defines classes representing application info and partial application info for a Discord bot, including metadata, assets, and permissions.",
  "sources": "Data input from API payloads used to initialize class attributes; user input is not directly read here.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external sources or over the network from this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from payloads into class attributes; no untrusted data flows to security-critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of type hints, class properties, and data parsing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class definitions, initializers, and property methods that process API response data. There are no suspicious functions, external network calls, or obfuscated segments. It imports standard libraries and internal modules without any dynamic code execution or malicious patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data models for Discord application information, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured, using typical patterns for handling API data and assets.",
