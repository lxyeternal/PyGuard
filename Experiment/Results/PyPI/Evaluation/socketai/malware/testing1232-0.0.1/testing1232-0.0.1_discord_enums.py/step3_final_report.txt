{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumeration classes for Discord API constants, including utility functions for handling unknown values and type checks.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, internal mappings, and static data within enum classes.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network calls, or file operations; purely static enum data.",
  "flows": "Internal enum value creation and lookups; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard enum patterns with fallback for unknown values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured enum classes representing Discord constants, with utility functions for safe value handling. No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of 'unknown' value creation is a common pattern for robustness. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the original reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1—are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe enumeration module for Discord API constants, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The original scores are accurate and appropriate.",
