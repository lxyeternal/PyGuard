  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines enums for Discord entities, sourced from class attributes and mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data, network, or file operations; data flows are limited to internal enum handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The creation of 'unknown' enum values is standard for robustness.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured enum definitions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, considering it’s just enum code).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard enum patterns, utility functions, and no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes standard enum classes, utility functions, and safe data structures.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on enum definitions, no external input or output, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar enumeration definitions, static data, no external data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely enum definitions, utility functions, and static mappings for Discord API constants.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. No network, file, or system commands.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden payloads.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the code, there are no assumptions or vulnerabilities. The only notable aspect is the support for unknown enum values, which is a standard safety pattern.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (static enum definitions), a risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high but acceptable; it could be lowered to 0 for maximum confidence, but 0.1 is reasonable considering potential misclassification.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 if we want to be very conservative)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard for an enum utility module, and poses no supply chain security threat.",
