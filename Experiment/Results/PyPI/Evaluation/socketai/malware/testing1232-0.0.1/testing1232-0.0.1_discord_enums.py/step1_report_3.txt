{
  "purpose": "This code defines various enumerations for a Discord-related library, providing structured constants for different types and states used in the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data mainly from class attributes, dictionary mappings, and enum values, without external input or user data processing.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands; the code primarily performs in-memory data structuring.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining enums, creating value classes, and establishing mappings and lookup functions, with no indication of external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard enum pattern and safe data structures. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a metaclass-based enumeration system for various Discord protocol constants. It includes safe mappings, comparison operators, and utility functions for handling unknown enum values. There are no network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted code. The design appears to be a straightforward and conventional implementation of enums with additional safety for unknown values.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured enumeration library for a Discord SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process external untrusted data in a harmful manner. Overall, it is safe and free from malicious intent.",
