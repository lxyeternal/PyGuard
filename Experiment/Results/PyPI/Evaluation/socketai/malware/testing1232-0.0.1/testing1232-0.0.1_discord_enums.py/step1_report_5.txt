{
  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations and utility functions for a Discord API library, primarily for handling different types, statuses, and categories used in Discord interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules, typing hints, and defines enum classes with static data; no external input sources or dynamic data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or output; the code is focused on defining constants and enums.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily creates static enum objects and helper functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; enums are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of enum definitions and helper functions for a Discord-related Python library. It includes utility methods for enum creation and value handling, with no input/output or external interactions. All operations are static and intended for categorization. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detectable. The code adheres to standard practices for defining enums and utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of enumeration definitions and utility functions for a Discord API library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for internal use within the library context.",
