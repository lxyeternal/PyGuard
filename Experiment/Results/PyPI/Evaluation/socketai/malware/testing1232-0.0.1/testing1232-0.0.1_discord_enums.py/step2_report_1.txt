  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines numerous enum classes for Discord API constants, reading from class attributes and internal mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing, network, or file I/O. Data flows are internal and static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code; standard enum patterns with support for unknown values.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is benign, with high confidence (0.95), no malware, and a very low security risk (0.1). The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—defining enums for Discord constants, with no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard enum setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines enums for Discord constants, no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard enum definitions with utility functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high; malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Enum classes for Discord, no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external I/O or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0), malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Enums for Discord constants, static data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard enum pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0), malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely for defining constants and utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or hidden payloads are evident.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is minimal, given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (No malicious intent or code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (Clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (Very low, mainly due to the support for unknown enum values, which is standard practice)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured enumeration library for Discord API constants. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
