{
  "purpose": "Define utility classes for object comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The 'id' attribute expected to be set on instances of the classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "Comparison and hashing operations rely on the 'id' attribute; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The classes assume 'id' exists but do not define or initialize it; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple comparison and hashing classes relying on an 'id' attribute. No external data, network calls, or data leaks are present. The use of __slots__ and bit-shifting in __hash__ are standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The reliance on an external 'id' attribute is typical for such utility classes but could lead to runtime errors if 'id' is not set. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and free of security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for object comparison and hashing, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
