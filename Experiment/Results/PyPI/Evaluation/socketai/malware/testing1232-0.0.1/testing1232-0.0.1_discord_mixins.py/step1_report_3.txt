  "purpose": "Define classes for equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or dangerous data handling points identified.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; class methods operate on internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, with basic comparison and hash functions based on an 'id' attribute. The classes use __slots__ for memory optimization. There is no input/output, network activity, or external data handling. The hash function shifts the 'id' to the right by 22 bits, which is a simple deterministic calculation. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve a normal purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not include any malicious or suspicious features.",
