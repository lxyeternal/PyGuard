  "purpose": "Define classes for equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and methods, specifically the 'id' attribute, and the __hash__ method computing hash from 'id'.",
  "sinks": "Methods (__eq__, __hash__) that operate on 'id' to provide comparison and hashing functionalities.",
  "flows": "Equality comparison and hash calculation flow based on the 'id' attribute of class instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious operations; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, which enable object comparison and hashing. Both classes rely solely on an 'id' attribute, with __hash__ computing a shifted version of 'id'. The implementation is typical for such utility classes. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or obfuscated code. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of comparison and hash functions for objects identified by 'id'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
