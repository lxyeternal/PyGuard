{
  "purpose": "Define two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, for comparing objects and generating hash values based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'id' attribute from class instances and the module's __all__ list for exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data, external input/output, or security-critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods access the 'id' attribute to perform equality checks and hashing; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The hash method shifts 'id' right by 22 bits, which is a straightforward computation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple class structures with methods for equality and hashing based on an 'id' attribute. No external input, data leaks, or malicious behavior is apparent. The only operation of note is the bit-shift in __hash__, which is a standard technique for creating a hash from an integer. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or harmful behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of equality and hash methods for classes with an 'id' attribute. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
