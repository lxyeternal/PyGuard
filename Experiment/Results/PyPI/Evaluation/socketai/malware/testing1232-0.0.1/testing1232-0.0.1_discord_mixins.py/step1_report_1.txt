{
  "purpose": "Defines two classes, EqualityComparable and Hashable, to facilitate equality comparison and hashing based on an 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no external calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily provides class definitions and methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code patterns. The use of bit-shifting in __hash__ is straightforward and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple class hierarchies with equality and hashing methods based on an 'id' attribute. No external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present. The class design is conventional for object comparison and hashing. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module defining equality and hash behavior for objects with an 'id' attribute. It shows no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
