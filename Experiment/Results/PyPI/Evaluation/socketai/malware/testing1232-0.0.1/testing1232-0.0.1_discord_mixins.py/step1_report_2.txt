  "purpose": "Define classes for equality comparison and hashing based on an integer 'id' attribute.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for EqualityComparable and Hashable, using an 'id' attribute for comparison and hashing. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns. It is licensed under MIT, with standard license text at the beginning. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code is simple and serves as utility classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward implementation of comparison and hashing classes with no malicious or security concerns.",
