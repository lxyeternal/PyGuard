  "purpose": "Define type variables and import annotations for type checking in a Python module related to a client class.",
  "sources": "Import statements, TYPE_CHECKING block, and assignment of ClientT",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks as code mainly involves type hints and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard type hinting pattern with conditional import for type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for forward references, and uses TYPE_CHECKING to conditionally import 'TypeVar' and 'Client' for type hints. It defines a generic type variable 'ClientT' bound to 'Client', with covariant variance. The structure follows common type hinting practices and does not contain any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no data is sent or written.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type hinting pattern used in Python modules to support static analysis and type checking. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
