  "purpose": "Define type variables and type annotations for use in a Python package, with conditional imports for type checking.",
  "sources": "Type checking conditional import block and the definition of 'ClientT'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be 'ClientT' type variable if misused or exploited, but in this context, it is only a type annotation.",
  "flows": "Type annotations assigned to 'ClientT' based on conditional import; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard for type hinting and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a common pattern to handle type annotations differently during static type checking and runtime. It defines a generic type variable 'ClientT' bound to a 'Client' class, with conditional imports to support type hints. No code execution, data handling, or input reading occurs that could lead to security issues. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type hinting setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign pattern used for static analysis support.",
