  "purpose": "Define type variables for static type checking, with conditional imports for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Reading of the __future__ import, standard typing imports, and conditional imports within the if TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not handle untrusted input or data output.",
  "flows": "Type annotations influence static analysis but do not execute at runtime; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for avoiding runtime imports during type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for a Client class, using a conditional import block that only executes during static type checking to prevent runtime import errors. The use of TypeVar with covariant bounds is standard for generic type annotations. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security issues. The structure is typical of a Python library's type hinting setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for type annotations with conditional imports, with no malicious or security-risk elements detected. It aims to improve type checking without affecting runtime behavior.",
