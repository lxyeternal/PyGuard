  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard license header, import statements, and conditional type variable definitions.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, file I/O, or untrusted data handling.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and `TypeVar` is typical for static type hinting in Python.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate static analysis and type checking, not runtime behavior.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** License info + type annotations; no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Type variable setup with conditional imports; standard practice.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious activity, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no change needed.\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard type hinting pattern.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious behavior, no security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** License + type annotations, standard pattern.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious intent, benign boilerplate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Type variable definition with conditional import; no data handling.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious activity; only static typing.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely boilerplate for licensing and type annotations.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate boilerplate used in Python projects for licensing and static type hinting. No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the report's scoring and conclusions are accurate.",
