  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard license header, import statements, and conditional type variable definitions for static type checking.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No runtime code, network operations, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and `TypeVar` is a common pattern in Python projects for static analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, serving only for type hinting and licensing.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; no security risk or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup for type annotations and licensing.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, standard boilerplate, and carries no security concerns.",
