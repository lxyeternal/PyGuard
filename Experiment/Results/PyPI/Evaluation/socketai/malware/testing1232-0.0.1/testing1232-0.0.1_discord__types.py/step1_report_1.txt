{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily a license and type annotations setup for a Python module, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static license text, imports future features, and conditionally defines a type variable based on type checking.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; no data flows from external sources or user input to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs; type annotations are static and not runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard license comments and a conditional type variable definition, which are common and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license information, import statements, and a conditional type variable definition based on the TYPE_CHECKING constant. The license is standard MIT license text, and the type annotations are straightforward and typical for type hinting with mypy or similar tools. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or untrusted data processing. It is a normal part of Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license and type hinting setup without any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to include licensing information and define type variables for static analysis, with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
