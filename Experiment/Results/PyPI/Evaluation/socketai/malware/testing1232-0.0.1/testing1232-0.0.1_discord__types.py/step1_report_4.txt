  "purpose": "Define type variables for type annotations in a Python module, with conditional imports based on type checking.",
  "sources": "Reading the license header, imports, and type annotation logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data or input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only type annotations and imports are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard practices for conditional type annotations and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header and standard import logic for type annotations. The 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block imports type hints and defines a type variable 'ClientT' conditionally. The else branch also defines 'ClientT' with a string-bound class. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. The structure is typical for Python modules that support type hinting with optional runtime imports. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation setup with licensing comments. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be legitimate boilerplate code for type hinting.",
