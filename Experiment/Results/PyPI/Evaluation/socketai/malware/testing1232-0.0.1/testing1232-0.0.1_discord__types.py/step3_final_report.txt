  "purpose": "Provides licensing information and sets up static type annotations for the package.",
  "sources": "The import of __future__.annotations, conditional import of TYPE_CHECKING, and definition of ClientT using TypeVar.",
  "sinks": "TypeVar assignment and conditional imports; no untrusted data or runtime data flow present.",
  "flows": "The type variable ClientT is defined based on the conditional import, used solely for static type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard boilerplate code with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license header, import statements, and a conditional type variable definition. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and TypeVar is a common pattern for static type hints. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard boilerplate for licensing and static type annotations, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
