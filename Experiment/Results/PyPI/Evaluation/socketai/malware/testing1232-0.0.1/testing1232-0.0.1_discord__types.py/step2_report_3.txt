  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard license header, import statements, and conditional type variable definitions.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n- The code is typical for Python projects that use type hints and conditional imports for static analysis.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: license text, `from __future__ import annotations`, conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` imports, and a `TypeVar` definition.\n- No issues with malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and include licensing info.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in each report aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is the `ClientT` type variable, which is used for static type annotations. Since it’s only a type hint, it does not pose runtime risks.\n- The \"sinks\" identified are only in the context of static analysis; no actual data flows or processing are happening.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard boilerplate for type annotations with licensing comments.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a typical, safe, and legitimate part of a Python package's type hinting setup.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
