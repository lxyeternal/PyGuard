{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of flag classes for managing various Discord entity attributes, permissions, intents, and settings using bitwise operations. It provides structured, reusable components to handle flags for channels, messages, users, members, applications, etc.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and methods, including flag value functions, class variables, and initialization parameters. No external or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data. The code does not process or output any user data, network operations, or external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data. The code purely manipulates internal class attributes and bitwise flag values.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of flag management with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated parts, or unexpected behaviors. All methods serve legitimate purposes for flag handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes using decorators to manage bitwise flags for Discord entities, with methods for combining, inverting, and checking flags. The flag_value decorator uses functions that simply return integers or flags from UserFlags, which are imported from an external enums module. There are no network operations, external data processing, or code execution mechanisms. The code is purely for internal flag management and configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Discord flag management classes with no malicious intent. It leverages standard bitwise operations and class structures to facilitate flag handling for various Discord features. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
