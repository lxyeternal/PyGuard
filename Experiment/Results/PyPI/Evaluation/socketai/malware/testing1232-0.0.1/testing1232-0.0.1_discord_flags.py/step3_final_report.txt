{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of classes for managing Discord API feature flags, permissions, intents, and related configurations using bitwise operations. It provides structured, internal representations for various flag states, facilitating easy setting, querying, and combination of flags within a Discord library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes, class variables, and constants; it does not process external input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data outputs, network calls, or system command executions; all operations are internal bitwise manipulations.",
  "flows": "Internal flag setting and retrieval via class properties and methods; no external data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard flag management practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class-based flag representations for Discord features, permissions, and intents, utilizing decorators, overloads, and class methods for configuration. It operates solely on internal constants and bitwise logic, with no external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The license is a standard MIT license, and no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The design is typical for internal flag management modules, with clear, readable code and predictable patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Discord API flag classes, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It functions solely as internal configuration management, and its design aligns with best practices for such use cases.",
