{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of flag management classes for various Discord-related features, such as message flags, user flags, intents, channel flags, etc. These classes facilitate bitwise operations and easy access to flag states.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant flag values via properties decorated with @flag_value and class attribute definitions. It does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or external data manipulation. No system commands, network calls, or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily manages internal state through bitwise operations on integer values. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. All flag values are defined as constants; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is evident. The code strictly manages bitwise flags with no external system interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-structured class-based flag management with bitwise operations, decorating properties with @flag_value for clarity. It includes methods for creating full or empty flags, as well as inverting flags. The use of classmethods for common flag configurations is standard. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The initial license header is a standard MIT license with no embedded malicious code. The code focuses solely on internal flag management, with no network or system interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of flag management classes for a Discord API library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious external interactions, and no obfuscated code. The risk of supply chain attack or sabotage appears negligible.",
