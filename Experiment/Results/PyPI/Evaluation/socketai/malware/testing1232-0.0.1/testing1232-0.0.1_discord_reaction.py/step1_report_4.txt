{
  "purpose": "Defines a Reaction class representing message reactions in a Discord-like system, including methods for managing reactions and retrieving users who reacted.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules, class constructor parameters, and HTTP response data in users() method.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from HTTP responses in users() method, which could potentially be manipulated if HTTP responses are compromised.",
  "flows": "Source: ReactionPayload data and HTTP responses -> sinks: message.remove_reaction, message.clear_reaction, message._state.http.get_reaction_users -> flows: method calls and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution. The code appears to use standard class methods, type hints, and HTTP calls typical for a messaging API client.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Reaction class with methods to remove, clear, and list users who reacted to a message. It relies on HTTP API calls to fetch user data. The HTTP responses are processed to yield User or Member objects. There is no indication of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The only external data interaction involves standard API calls for reaction data and user removal, which are expected in this context. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or malicious actions are present. The code's purpose aligns with managing message reactions in a typical chat application.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for handling message reactions in a chat system. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The security risk is low, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this isolated module.",
