  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard WebSocket client for Discord gateway and voice.\n- Sources/Sinks: Incoming/outgoing WebSocket data, no suspicious external activity.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Uses common patterns, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar WebSocket implementation for Discord.\n- Sources/Sinks: Network data, no external leaks.\n- Anomalies: No credentials or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard handling, no malicious signs.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no sabotage.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Typical Discord WebSocket client.\n- Sources/Sinks: No external data leaks, no secrets.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Follows expected patterns, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Standard, legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard WebSocket client for Discord.\n- Sources/Sinks: No suspicious network activity.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical implementation, no malicious signs.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, handling connection, heartbeat, events.\n- Sources/Sinks: No external leaks or secrets.\n- Anomalies: No obfuscation or credentials.\n- Analysis: Follows standard patterns, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — very low, fitting the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard WebSocket handling without vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, **none of the reports show signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk**. The code snippets are standard implementations of Discord WebSocket clients, following documented protocols and best practices.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. No suspicious activities or sabotage are evident.",
