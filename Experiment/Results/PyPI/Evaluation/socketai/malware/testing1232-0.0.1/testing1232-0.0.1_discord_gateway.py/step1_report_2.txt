{
  "purpose": "This code implements WebSocket protocols for Discord's gateway and voice connections, including connection management, heartbeats, and event handling.",
  "sources": "Reads include network data from WebSocket responses, decompression buffers, and input parameters such as IP, port, and mode. Also reads from threading events and system time.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over WebSocket connections, including heartbeat frames, identification, resume, status updates, and voice protocol data. No data appears to be sent to external servers outside of Discord's infrastructure.",
  "flows": "Network data flows from WebSocket receive buffers to decompression and JSON parsing; commands and heartbeats flow from internal functions to WebSocket send methods; some functions read system info for connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. Usage of threading and asyncio together is standard for real-time network handling. No suspicious data leaks or privacy violations are apparent. No obfuscated or misleading code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of WebSocket clients for Discord, managing heartbeat, reconnects, and event handling. It uses secure WebSocket connections, handles reconnection signals properly, and manages latency. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data flows are found. All network data flows are consistent with Discord's WebSocket protocol. No suspicious side effects or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, legitimate implementation of Discord WebSocket protocol handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It properly manages connections, heartbeats, and events without leaking data or executing unauthorized actions.",
