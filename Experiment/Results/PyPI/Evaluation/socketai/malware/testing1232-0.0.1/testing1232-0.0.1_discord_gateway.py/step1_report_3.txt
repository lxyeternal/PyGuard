{
  "purpose": "The code implements WebSocket clients for Discord's gateway and voice connections, managing connection, heartbeat, and event handling for Discord bots.",
  "sources": "Reads include incoming WebSocket messages, heartbeat responses, and connection status; also reads thread IDs and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over WebSocket connections via send_str, including JSON-encoded command payloads and heartbeats. No direct data leaks or external data exfiltration points are apparent.",
  "flows": "Incoming messages (source) are processed to handle events, heartbeats, or reconnection signals; outgoing data (sink) includes heartbeat and command payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious network domains or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns typical for WebSocket communication. Heartbeat and reconnect mechanisms follow standard Discord protocol. No backdoors, malicious commands, or data exfiltration routines are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical patterns for WebSocket handling with explicit event processing, heartbeat management, and reconnection logic. The implementation manages WebSocket states, handles incoming events, and sends appropriate JSON commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as secret exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated routines. The code appears to be standard and intended for legitimate Discord bot operations. It relies on publicly documented protocols and standard libraries. All data flows are confined to WebSocket communications with no external or hidden data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Discord WebSocket clients for gateway and voice connections, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It manages connection, events, and heartbeats in accordance with Discord's specifications. No security risks or malware signs are evident.",
