  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard WebSocket client for Discord, handling connection, heartbeat, and message processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses typical libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (low, given standard operations, perhaps slightly conservative but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard WebSocket handling with no suspicious data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses standard protocols.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 (very low, consistent with standard code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard WebSocket client for Discord, managing connection and events.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no malicious signs.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for such code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, handling WebSocket communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, WebSocket client for Discord.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no security concerns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0 (no issues)\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear, readable, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all, reflecting standard WebSocket handling without vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of Discord WebSocket clients, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 - 0.2 (very low, typical for well-structured network clients)\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code review.",
