{
  "purpose": "The code implements WebSocket clients for Discord's gateway and voice communication, handling connection management, heartbeat, and event processing.",
  "sources": "Reads include incoming WebSocket messages, connection parameters, session and sequence IDs, and user activity/status data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as session IDs, tokens, IP addresses, and secret keys are processed and sent over WebSocket connections.",
  "flows": "Source: Incoming messages (bytes, JSON data); Sinks: WebSocket send methods, connection control commands, heartbeat signals, and presence updates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed. The code follows standard patterns for WebSocket communication. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No suspicious external network calls or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of Discord WebSocket clients with heartbeat, event handling, and connection management. It uses standard libraries and patterns without evidence of malicious activity. The functions perform expected tasks such as connection, heartbeat, message receipt, and session handling. No suspicious data manipulation, external data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are detected. The presence of logging is standard for debugging and monitoring. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate client implementation for Discord, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of WebSocket clients for Discord with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles connection, heartbeat, and event processing as expected, without including malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
