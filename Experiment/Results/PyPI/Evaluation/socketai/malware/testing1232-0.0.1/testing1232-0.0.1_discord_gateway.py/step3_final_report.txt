{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket client for Discord's gateway and voice protocols, managing connection, heartbeat, event handling, and reconnection logic.",
  "sources": "Incoming WebSocket messages, payloads for identify, resume, heartbeat, presence, voice state, and other control frames.",
  "sinks": "Outgoing JSON payloads for connection management, presence updates, voice control, and heartbeat signals.",
  "flows": "Sources include received messages and internal state variables; sinks include sending JSON payloads over WebSocket; flows involve message reception leading to event dispatch and response payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of Discord's WebSocket clients for gateway and voice. It handles connection, heartbeat, event processing, and reconnection appropriately. No malicious activity, payloads, or sabotage are evident. The absence of obfuscation and hardcoded secrets aligns with legitimate design. The security risk is low, primarily due to handling sensitive tokens and session IDs, but no vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Discord's WebSocket clients with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting standard low-risk network client code.",
