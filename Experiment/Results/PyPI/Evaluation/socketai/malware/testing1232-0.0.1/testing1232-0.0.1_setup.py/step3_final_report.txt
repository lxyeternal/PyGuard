  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup configuration with static metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static setup parameters; package directory 'discord'; dependency 'requests==2.31.0'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of 'discord' package directory; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The package name 'discord' could warrant external review, but within this script, it is just a directory. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight elevation in security risk scores (0.1) is due to the package name but is not justified by code content.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and aligns with standard practices. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The minor risk score based on the package name is acceptable but should be verified externally. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
