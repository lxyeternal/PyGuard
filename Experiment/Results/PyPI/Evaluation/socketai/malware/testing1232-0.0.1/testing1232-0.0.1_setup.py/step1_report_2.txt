  "flows": "No complex data flows; primarily static configuration and dependency declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The package declares a package named 'discord' without further context. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define a Python package. It specifies basic metadata, dependencies, and package contents. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The package name and author are generic, and the dependency is a standard library version, with no indications of malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
