  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code execution, process spawning, and lack of validation. It should be considered malicious, and its use should be avoided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9-1.0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
