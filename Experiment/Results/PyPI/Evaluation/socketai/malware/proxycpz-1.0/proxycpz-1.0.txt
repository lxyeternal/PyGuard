It employs techniques that can be considered mildly obfuscated but are primarily indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is maximal, and the malware likelihood is certain."

It should be considered malicious, and its use should be avoided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9-1.0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
