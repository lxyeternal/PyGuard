{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'proxycpz', with additional code that downloads and executes external code.",
  "sources": "The temporary file created with the URL request, and the code executed via system call.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function that runs code fetched from the URL, and the system call that executes the temporary file.",
  "flows": "Code fetches content from 'https://paste.website/p/400c3e4b-a59b-4598-a199-75e848aeaae3.txt' and executes it; then attempts to run the temporary file which contains obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically downloads and executes remote code, which is a major security concern. The temporary file contains an obfuscated payload, and the use of 'exec' and system calls indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup-related functions and temporarily writing a payload that downloads code from a remote URL and executes it immediately. It then attempts to run this temporary file, which contains obfuscated code that also executes remote content. The setup configuration appears benign, but the presence of remote code execution, dynamic code download, and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. The code does not validate or sanitize remote content, making it highly dangerous. This pattern is characteristic of malware or supply chain attacks designed to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code without validation, using obfuscation to hide intent, and executing potentially harmful payloads. It should be considered malicious, posing a high security risk.",
