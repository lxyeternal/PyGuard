  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'proxycpz' that appears to automate some installation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reading system executable path, creating and writing to a temporary file, executing system commands.",
  "sinks": "Executing a system command that runs a temporarily created file, which executes code fetched from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "Temporary file creation -> writing Python code that fetches and executes remote content -> executing this file via system command.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes remote code without validation, uses a temporary file with suspicious inline code, and attempts to run it in a separate process. The remote URL could host malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions and system modules, then creates a temporary file containing Python code that fetches and executes content from an external URL. It then tries to execute this temporary file with a modified executable name. This behavior suggests remote code execution, which is highly suspicious. The setup() call appears normal but is likely a cover for the malicious activity, which is hidden in the remote fetch. The overall pattern is characteristic of malicious code designed to run remote payloads stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code without validation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The setup function is used as a facade, but the real purpose is remote code execution, which is extremely dangerous.",
