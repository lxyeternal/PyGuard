{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address, and then send this data to a remote server during the installation process of a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading from /proc/uptime, platform module for system info, socket.gethostbyname for IP address, and socket connection to remote server (134.209.85.64:9090).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via socket connection to a remote server, specifically through clientSocket.send(str(sendable_string).encode()).",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources flows into the 'sendable_string' variable, which is then sent over the network socket to the remote IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends system info to an external IP address during package installation without user consent, which is suspicious. No user input validation or authorization checks are present. The IP address and port are hardcoded. The purpose appears to be unauthorized data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'createfile' that collects system uptime, OS details, and IP address, then establishes a socket connection to a specific external IP address and transmits this data. The function is invoked during the custom post-installation step of the package setup. The data transmission occurs silently during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a typical setup script. No encryption or obfuscation is used in data transmission. There are no other malicious payloads, but the behavior resembles data exfiltration, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and silently transmits data to an external server during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and could be considered malicious or at least a privacy violation. It likely constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration.",
