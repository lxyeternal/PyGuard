{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for installing a Python package named 'numoy' with a custom post-installation step that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, gathers system details using the platform module, hostname via socket, and network details through socket.gethostbyname.",
  "sinks": "The remote server at IP 134.209.85.64 on port 9090 receives data sent over a socket connection, which includes system uptime, OS info, and IP details.",
  "flows": "The system info collected in createfile() is sent directly over the socket to the specified IP address after being converted to a string and encoded, creating a source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively transmits system information to an external IP address during installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts and indicates potential data exfiltration. The IP address and the action of sending data post-installation are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script installs a package and defines a custom post-installation command that, upon execution, collects system uptime, OS details, hostname IP address, and then sends this data to a hardcoded external IP address via a socket connection. This behavior is not typical for package installation routines and suggests possible malicious activity such as system information harvesting or backdoor functionality. The IP address is hardcoded, and there are no apparent checks or user prompts, which further indicates malicious intent. The code does not include any obfuscation or dynamic code execution, but its intent to silently exfiltrate data during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and malicious activity embedded within what appears to be a package setup script.",
