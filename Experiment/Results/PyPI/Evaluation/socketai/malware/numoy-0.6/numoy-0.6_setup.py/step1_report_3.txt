{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address, and then send this information to a remote server. It also sets up a package installation process that executes this data collection during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads /proc/uptime for system uptime, reads platform and socket for OS and network info, and initiates a socket connection to a remote IP address (134.209.85.64:9090) to send data.",
  "sinks": "The socket.send() method transmits collected data over the network to an external IP address, potentially exposing sensitive system info to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from /proc/uptime and platform/socket modules flows into a formatted string, which is then sent via socket to a remote server during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends detailed system information to an external IP address during package installation without user consent or notification. No user input is involved, and the remote address appears hardcoded. The creation of network connections during installation is suspicious. The use of socket connection in setup scripts for data exfiltration is atypical.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system uptime, OS info, and IP address, then connects to a specific remote server to send this data, which is characteristic of data exfiltration behavior. It is embedded within a custom installation command that runs automatically during package setup, increasing its stealth. The IP address and data transmission are potential indicators of malicious activity or surveillance. No other malicious payloads, such as code execution or backdoors, are present. Usage of standard modules and functions suggests no obfuscation, but the behavior itself is suspicious for a supply chain attack or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly collecting system info and exfiltrating it during package installation. This pattern indicates a probable malicious intent to monitor or compromise target systems without user awareness.",
