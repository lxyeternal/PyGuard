  "purpose": "The code gathers system information and uptime, then transmits this data to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, collects platform and network information, and performs a socket connection to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection to 134.209.85.64:9090 where system info is sent.",
  "flows": "Reads system info and uptime -> formats data -> establishes socket connection -> sends data to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting detailed system info and immediately sending it to a hardcoded external IP during package installation. No user input or validation involved. No clear benign purpose for this data transmission is provided.",
  "analysis": "The script is embedded within a custom installation command that runs upon package install. It collects system uptime, OS details, and IP address, then sends this information to a hardcoded IP address (134.209.85.64) over a TCP socket. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance without user consent. The data transmission occurs automatically during the installation process, which is suspicious. No explicit user consent or transparency is indicated. No obfuscation or malicious code like reverse shells or data theft from other sources is present. The purpose appears to be remote system monitoring or potential malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious or at least suspicious behavior with potential privacy violations. This is consistent with malicious activity such as surveillance or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is high.",
