  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior—silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate. The package should be considered malicious or compromised, warranting further analysis of the payload and cautious handling."
