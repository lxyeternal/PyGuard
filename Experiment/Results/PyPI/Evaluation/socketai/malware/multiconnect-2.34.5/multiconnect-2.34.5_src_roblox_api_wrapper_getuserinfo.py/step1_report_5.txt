{
  "purpose": "Function intended to retrieve information about a logged-in user",
  "sources": "None; no data reading or input handling present in the code",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, output, or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow since the function is not implemented",
  "anomalies": "Function is defined but contains no implementation; import of 'requests' module is unused, which could be suspicious if the code were incomplete or malicious, but here it appears to be an unfinished stub",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library, which is often used for network communication. However, the function 'getuserinfo' is a placeholder with no operational code. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows within the provided snippet. The presence of an unused import and an unimplemented function may suggest incomplete or placeholder code, not necessarily malicious. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The code by itself does not perform any harmful activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an incomplete placeholder for a user info retrieval function. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, and no security risks are evident in its current form.",
