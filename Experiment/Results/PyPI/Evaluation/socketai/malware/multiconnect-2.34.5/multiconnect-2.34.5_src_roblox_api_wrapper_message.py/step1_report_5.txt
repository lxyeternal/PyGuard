  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the 'send' operation (though it's currently a placeholder)",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to the send operation (not implemented)",
  "anomalies": "The function body is empty (pass statement), indicating no actual implementation, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or malicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function with no implementation. It does not read from external sources, nor does it perform any operations that could be malicious. The parameters suggest intended use, but without actual code, there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detectable. The placeholder 'pass' indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a stub function with no active logic or security issues. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in its current form.",
