  "purpose": "The function is intended to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'send' function execution which would process or transmit the message.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'send' function, but since the function body is empty, no actual data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a placeholder function 'send' with parameters but does not perform any actions. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows beyond parameter acceptance. No malicious or suspicious code is evident. The code appears to be a stub or a placeholder, lacking actual logic or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder function with no implementation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
