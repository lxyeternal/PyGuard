{
  "purpose": "The function is designed to send a message from a user to a recipient.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' serve as sources of data, potentially untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "The function body is empty ('pass'), so there are no sinks where data could be processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data flows within the function since it contains no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The function is a stub with no implementation, which is unusual for a message-sending function. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function intended to send messages, but it lacks implementation. It accepts three parameters that could be sources of untrusted data but does not process, validate, or transmit them. The absence of any code within the function means no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The structure is minimal and does not reveal any obfuscation or malware. The code appears to be a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this minimal stub. The code is non-functional as-is, possibly incomplete, but shows no signs of malicious activity.",
