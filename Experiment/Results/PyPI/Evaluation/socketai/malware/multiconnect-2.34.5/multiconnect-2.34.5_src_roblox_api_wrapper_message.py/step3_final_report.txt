  "purpose": "A placeholder function intended to send a message from a User to a recipient.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' (potential input points, but unused).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; function does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; parameters are unused and function body is empty.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple stub with no logic, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function with three parameters but contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating it is a placeholder with no implementation. There are no external calls, data processing, or malicious behaviors. The parameters could be sources of untrusted data, but since they are unused, no data flow or vulnerabilities are present. The absence of code logic, secrets, or obfuscation suggests no security issues. The high confidence scores (close to 1) across reports are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is 0 or very close to it, reflecting the non-functional nature of the stub. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-functional placeholder with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal state. No further action is necessary, but future implementations should be re-evaluated for security concerns if the function is expanded.",
