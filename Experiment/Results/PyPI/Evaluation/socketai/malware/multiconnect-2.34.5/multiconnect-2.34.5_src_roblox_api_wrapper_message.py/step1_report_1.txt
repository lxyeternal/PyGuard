  "purpose": "Function to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', and 'message'",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'send' function implementation could send data externally, but it's currently empty",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'user', 'recipient', and 'message' parameters to the 'send' function, but without implementation, no flow occurs",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function is a placeholder with no implementation; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple 'send' function with parameters but contains no logic or external calls. Since the function body is empty, there are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed, and the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a placeholder function with no implementation; it poses no security risk or malicious behavior in its current form. It simply defines an interface for sending messages without performing any action.",
