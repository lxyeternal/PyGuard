  "purpose": "The code appears to define placeholder functions for logging into roblox.com API using cookies or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' in the functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; functions are empty and do not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions are not implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation, only 'pass' statements; no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two stub functions intended for login processes, but they do nothing. There are no data handling, no external communications, no processing of untrusted data, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The code structure is simple and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. Since these are just placeholders, there is no malicious activity, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of placeholder function definitions without implementation. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks present.",
