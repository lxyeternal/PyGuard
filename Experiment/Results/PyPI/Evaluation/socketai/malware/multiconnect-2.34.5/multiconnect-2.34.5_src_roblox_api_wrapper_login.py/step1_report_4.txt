  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into roblox.com API using cookie or username/password credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password'. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed; functions currently do nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since the functions are empty and do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no implementation; potential for future malicious code but currently benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for login operations but they are empty and perform no actions. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data processing, and no external interactions. Without implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred. The functions' naming suggests purpose but lack any logic or security checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal stub with no operational or malicious code. It does not perform any actions or pose any security risk at this stage. The functions are placeholders, and no malicious behavior is present.",
