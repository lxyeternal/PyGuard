  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API integration",
  "sources": "Function definitions 'cookielogin(cookie)' and 'userpasslogin(username, password)' with no internal logic",
  "sinks": "None, as functions contain only 'pass' statements and do not process data or perform external calls",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; functions are inert with no execution paths",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty placeholders with no implementation; no anomalies or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two empty functions intended for login operations, with no logic, data handling, or external communication. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the placeholder nature and assign low malware and security risk scores, which are consistent with the code's benign state. Given the absence of any malicious activity or obfuscation, the current scores are appropriate. The functions could pose future risks if implemented maliciously, but as-is, they are harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as placeholders without any malicious or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's current state. No modifications are necessary; future re-evaluation should occur if the functions are implemented with actual logic.",
