  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for Roblox API login processes, currently non-functional.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', 'password' in the functions.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or external data transmission implemented.",
  "flows": "None, as functions contain only 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but do not perform any operations; potential for future malicious code insertion exists but currently none.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two stub functions for login, one accepting a cookie, the other a username and password. Both functions do nothing, as they contain only 'pass'. There are no external calls, data processing, or security-sensitive operations present. The functions appear to be placeholders for future implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. Given the minimal implementation, there is no evidence of malware or security risks at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is merely placeholder stubs with no active logic or malicious intent. No security issues or malware risks are present based on this fragment.",
