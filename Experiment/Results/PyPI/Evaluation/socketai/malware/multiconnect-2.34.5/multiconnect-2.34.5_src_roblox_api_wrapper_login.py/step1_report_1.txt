{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for user authentication with Roblox API, but currently do not implement any login functionality.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' (input data), but functions do not process or handle data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks present; functions are empty and do not perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur since functions are empty and contain no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are stubbed with 'pass' statements and do nothing, which is unusual if intended for login; potential placeholder or incomplete implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions meant for login purposes but contains no logic or security-critical operations. No data is processed, no external calls are made, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. The functions are placeholders, which could be used in the future, but as-is, they pose no security risk. The absence of implementation means no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal placeholder with no operational content, posing no security threats or malicious intent. It appears to be an incomplete stub rather than malicious code or a security risk.",
