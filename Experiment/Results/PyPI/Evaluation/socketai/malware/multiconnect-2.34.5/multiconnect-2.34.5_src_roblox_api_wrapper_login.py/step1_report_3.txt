  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login operations to Roblox API, but currently do nothing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password' received by functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted systems are present; functions do not process or transmit data",
  "flows": "No active data flow or processing occurs within these functions",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but lack implementation; no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for login purposes but both are empty placeholders. No data is processed, stored, or transmitted. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscated code, or other malicious indicators. The functions' existence suggests planned functionality, but as-is, they do not perform any actions, malicious or otherwise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only consists of placeholder functions without implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in its current state. It appears to be preparatory code awaiting further development.",
