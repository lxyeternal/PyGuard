{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package, but it includes a malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The encrypted Fernet payload and the hardcoded decryption key within the install class; the class name and description strings also suggest obfuscation.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted code executed via exec() during install, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, remote code download, or backdoor establishment.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts the payload and executes it via exec(), potentially leading to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded decryption key, execution of decrypted code at install time, nonsensical description strings, and an obfuscated class name.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, on Windows, decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it dynamically. The encrypted payload and obfuscated strings suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a common malware tactic, indicating potential backdoor or malicious activity. The package name and descriptions are suspiciously misspelled or nonsensical, further indicating obfuscation. The dependencies include 'fernet' and 'requests', which could be used maliciously in conjunction with the decrypted payload. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious potential, with dynamic code execution and obfuscation patterns typical of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows, with obfuscation and encrypted payloads indicating malicious intent. The package should be flagged as highly suspicious or malicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended.",
