  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the actual purpose cannot be definitively determined without seeing the full code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules that handle data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of system commands, but specifics cannot be confirmed without full context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions toward output destinations such as network, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls are detected in the provided fragment. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward implementation without suspicious patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious API usage, or malicious data handling. Due to the lack of context and code content, the assessment is based on available code snippet, which does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but without the complete code, absolute certainty is limited.",
