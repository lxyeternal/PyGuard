  "purpose": "The code performs standard data processing or server setup routines without signs of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; likely standard input or data files.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs or network responses, but no untrusted data flows or leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, with no suspicious or insecure data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The scores reflect low risk (0.2), zero malware, and no obfuscation, consistent with the description. Confidence is high (0.8) due to clear benign patterns. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. The analysis is consistent and justified.",
