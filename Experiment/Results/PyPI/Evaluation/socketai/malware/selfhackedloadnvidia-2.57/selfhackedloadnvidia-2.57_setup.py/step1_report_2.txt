{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily setting up a Python package called 'selfhackedloadnvidia' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input source: None explicitly; it reads the filesystem to check for 'tahg' directory. No other explicit input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes obfuscated PowerShell command, which is suspicious as it may run malicious code. The setup function is standard and not a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check leads to execution of PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen; the flow from filesystem check to execution indicates a potential malicious action triggered if 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which is unusual and suspicious. The command appears to decode and run hidden code, potentially malicious. The rest of the setup code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from distutils.core. It then tries to import subprocess and os modules. If a directory 'tahg' does not exist, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, which is suspicious and typical of malicious code obfuscation. The setup function defines a package with metadata, which seems standard. The execution of obfuscated code without any validation or clear purpose indicates malicious intent or sabotage, possibly attempting to run hidden malicious payloads during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, likely malicious. The rest appears to be a standard package setup, but the presence of hidden code execution indicates a malicious supply chain risk. The package could run malicious code upon installation if the condition is met.",
