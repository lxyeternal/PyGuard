  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, warranting caution and further decoding of the payload for confirmation."
