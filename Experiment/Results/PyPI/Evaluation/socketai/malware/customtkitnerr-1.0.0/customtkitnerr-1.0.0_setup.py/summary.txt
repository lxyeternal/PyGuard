  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation on Windows, obfuscation, and embedded cryptographic keys. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, and further analysis of the decrypted payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
