  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation command with embedded decryption and potentially malicious code execution.",
  "sources": "os.name, requests, fernet, embedded encrypted data, decrypted code execution",
  "sinks": "exec() call on decrypted data, network request via requests if OS is Windows",
  "flows": "os.name check -> requests and Fernet import -> decryption of embedded data -> execution of decrypted code",
  "anomalies": "Unusual obfuscation in variable and class names, encrypted payload embedded within code, execution of decrypted code at install time, use of exec() with decrypted data",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package named 'customtkitnerr' with obfuscated class names and data. It includes a custom install command class that, when run on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an embedded encrypted payload, and executes it via exec(). The presence of encrypted payloads and execution of decrypted code at install time are suspicious. This pattern suggests potential malicious activity, such as executing hidden malicious code during installation. The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide malicious behavior. The setup specifies insecurely that 'fernet' and 'requests' are required, which are used in conjunction with the decrypted payload. Overall, this code contains suspicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network dependencies typical of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior including encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, with obfuscated class names and embedded encrypted data. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to execute hidden malicious code when installed on Windows systems.",
