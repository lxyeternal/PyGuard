{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with potential hidden malicious functionality that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Decryption of hardcoded Fernet token and encrypted payload within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec() if the OS is Windows.",
  "flows": "Encrypted data (Fernet token and payload) → Fernet decrypt() → exec() on decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a heavily obfuscated class name and variable names, decryption of embedded encrypted code, execution via exec(), conditional execution only on Windows, and inclusion of suspicious long, nonsensical descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup parameters for a package named 'customtkitnerr'. It includes a custom installation class 'dxscLIGhSpLczcrOuXUTOohwXDLbnCvgLFYvoKQCYmlQkKmtMTvSPGXJHYHoAFVzbJUsZewiPaZNJVnuizsHYoAaTlUUXXdiJYsNaptliBOlwIA' which overrides the run() method. Within run(), if the OS is Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it via exec(). This pattern suggests the code is designed to decrypt and run malicious code during installation on Windows. The encrypted strings are not human-readable, and the decryption and execution only occur on Windows, indicating an attempt to hide malicious actions or payloads. The obfuscation of class and variable names adds to suspicion. The code leverages a legitimate setup process but embeds malicious behavior that is conditional, dynamic, and hidden.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior aimed at decrypting and executing hidden code during package installation on Windows systems. This behavior indicates a high probability of malicious intent intended to conceal malicious payloads. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered unsafe.",
