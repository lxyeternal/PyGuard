      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression are red flags indicating potential sabotage or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend treating this package as malicious and conducting further analysis of the decoded payload."
