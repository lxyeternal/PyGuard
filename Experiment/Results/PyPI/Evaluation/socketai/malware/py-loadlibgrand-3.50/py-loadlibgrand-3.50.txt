      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, with embedded malicious infrastructure indicators. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL justify a malware score of approximately 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.8, and security risk score of 0.9. It should be flagged for further analysis and considered malicious in its current form."
