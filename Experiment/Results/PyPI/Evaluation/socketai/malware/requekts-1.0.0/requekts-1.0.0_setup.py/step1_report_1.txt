{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package called 'requekts' with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes decryption and code execution on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and imports modules such as 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'. It also reads hardcoded byte strings for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec() function when the OS is Windows. Potential network activity via 'requests' (though not explicitly used here).",
  "flows": "On Windows, 'os.name' check triggers import of 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a byte string with Fernet, and executes the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encrypted byte strings and conditional code execution based on OS. The code decrypts and executes code dynamically, which is suspicious, especially in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the run() method. When installing on Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it. The decryption key and encrypted data are embedded directly in the script, which is unusual for a legitimate setup script. The 'exec' call executes potentially malicious code at install time if the OS is Windows, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The inclusion of network modules and encryption suggests the possibility of downloading or executing malicious payloads. The rest of the code appears to be standard setup configuration, but the dynamic execution is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior indicators, notably the conditional execution of decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The use of hardcoded encrypted payload and execution via 'exec' signifies potential malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or malicious installer. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or at high risk.",
