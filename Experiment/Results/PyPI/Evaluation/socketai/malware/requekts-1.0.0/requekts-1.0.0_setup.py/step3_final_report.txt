{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads the OS environment variable 'os.name' and imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' modules during the run method; it also accesses hardcoded encrypted data and cryptographic keys.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via 'exec()', which can run arbitrary code, potentially leading to malicious actions such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: OS environment check and import statements; Payload: Hardcoded encrypted data and key; Sink: 'exec()' executes decrypted code, enabling malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and encrypted payloads; conditional execution only on Windows; dynamic code execution via 'exec()'; obfuscated description strings; embedded encrypted data that likely conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during execution on Windows, imports modules, decrypts a hardcoded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via 'exec()'. The presence of encrypted payloads, obfuscated descriptions, and conditional malicious code execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The use of 'exec()' on decrypted data is a common backdoor technique. The cryptographic secrets and payload are embedded directly, indicating obfuscation and concealment. The behavior is consistent with malware designed to run arbitrary code during setup, posing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows. The use of hardcoded secrets, encrypted payloads, and dynamic execution indicates a high probability of malicious intent. The package should be considered malicious and avoided.",
