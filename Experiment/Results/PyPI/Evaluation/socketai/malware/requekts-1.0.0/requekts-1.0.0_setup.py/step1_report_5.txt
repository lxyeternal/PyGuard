{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'requekts' with custom installation behavior that includes decrypting and executing embedded code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements (requests, fernet), embedded encrypted string for Fernet key, encrypted Fernet token, setup configuration data",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, imports of requests and Fernet modules during install",
  "flows": "os.name condition triggers import and execution of Fernet-decrypted code, which is executed via exec() potentially leading to code execution with malicious payload",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encrypted Fernet key and token, execution of decrypted code via exec(), conditional code execution only on Windows, obfuscated description and long_description contents, presence of code that decrypts and executes potentially malicious payload",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup functions and defines a custom install class that, during installation on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code from embedded encrypted strings. The use of hardcoded cryptographic material and exec() indicates potential malicious behavior, as it allows execution of arbitrary code. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical, but the embedded decrypt-and-execute pattern is suspicious, especially given the obfuscated description fields and conditional execution. This pattern is often used to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. The package's purpose seems to involve executing hidden code during install, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior due to decrypting and executing embedded encrypted code during installation on Windows systems, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded cryptographic secrets and use of exec() reinforce concerns about malicious backdoors or payloads being delivered during install.",
