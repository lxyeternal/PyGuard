  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'requekts' that customizes installation behavior.",
  "sources": "os.name, os module; potential requests module import; embedded encrypted data for Fernet decryption.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code; import requests, Fernet; use of Fernet.decrypt with hardcoded key.",
  "flows": "If on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, decrypts embedded code with Fernet, then executes it with exec() during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted data that is decrypted and executed conditionally; use of exec() on decrypted payload; hardcoded Fernet key; obfuscated long description.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, when run on Windows (nt), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from cryptography, then decrypts an embedded encrypted string using a hardcoded key. The decrypted data is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary code. The setup script itself appears standard but contains suspicious behavior with encrypted payload execution during install, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor. The encrypted payload and use of exec() are notable anomalies, with no benign reason for executing decrypted code during setup. The package description and long description are heavily obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly hiding intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior, notably executing decrypted code during installation on Windows systems, likely to run arbitrary or malicious code. The presence of encrypted payloads and hardcoded cryptographic keys suggests an attempt to hide malicious functionality. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious potential.",
