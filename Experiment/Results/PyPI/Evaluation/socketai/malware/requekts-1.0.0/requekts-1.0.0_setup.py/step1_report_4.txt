{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom installation behavior that includes executing decryption and code execution on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), decrypting and executing code via Fernet, reading setup parameters",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, network requests made by requests module (potential data exfiltration), importing potentially malicious modules",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests & Fernet -> decrypt and execute code if on Windows -> package setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload and dynamic code execution with exec(), decrypting code at install time, absence of validation for decrypted code, embedding decryption key within the code, use of obscure description and long strings as placeholders",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts and executes code via Fernet. The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, which suggests an attempt to conceal malicious code. The code execution occurs during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. The setup parameters are obfuscated with nonsensical descriptions and long strings, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The use of requests and Fernet modules, combined with code execution, points to possible malicious behavior such as backdoor installation, remote code execution, or data exfiltration. The presence of network modules and decrypting code at install time indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious behavior designed to execute decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. The hardcoded decryption key and execution of potentially malicious code via exec() suggest an embedded backdoor or malicious payload. The overall risk is high, and this package should be considered dangerous for use.",
