{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'requekts', including a custom installation class that executes encrypted code on Windows during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function with decrypted data potentially executes malicious code sourced from the encrypted payload, which is a major security concern.",
  "flows": "On Windows systems, os.name triggers import of requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload via exec().",
  "anomalies": "The use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that decrypts and executes code dynamically during installation is highly suspicious. No clear legitimate purpose is provided for this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration with a custom install command class, 'GruppeInstall'. This class, when run on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography'. It then decrypts an encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code. The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, suggesting intentional concealment. The 'exec()' function is a significant red flag because it can run arbitrary code. The use of such techniques during setup indicates a potential attempt to run malicious code during installation, possibly as a backdoor or malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior via the dynamic decryption and execution of hidden code during installation on Windows systems. The hardcoded encryption key and payload strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing a backdoor or executing unauthorized code. This package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
