  "purpose": "Detect potential malicious activity in the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell execution and suspicious comments.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess.Popen call executing encoded PowerShell command; the comment with suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executing the encoded PowerShell command; potential network activity or payload execution.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory -> execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> potential malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Silent error handling with broad try-except blocks; encoded PowerShell command embedded in code; comment referencing suspicious URL; execution triggered only if 'tahg' does not exist.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks but contains a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently under specific conditions. The command is base64-encoded, indicating obfuscation. The silent try-except blocks hide errors, which is typical in malicious scripts. The comment referencing a suspicious URL further raises suspicion. The obfuscation score is justified at 0.9, and the malware score should be increased from 0.5 to 0.75 to reflect high malicious potential. The security risk score is appropriate at 0.85 due to the potential for remote code execution or payload delivery. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious intent, warranting elevated scores and further decoding of the PowerShell command to confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains highly obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell code executed silently, with suspicious comments and error suppression. Scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware at 0.75, obfuscation at 0.9, and risk at 0.85. The package should be treated as potentially malicious pending further analysis.",
