      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, referencing a malicious domain. The obfuscation and external URL strongly indicate malicious activity, likely for remote payload delivery or system compromise. The package appears to be a vector for supply chain attack. The high scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is very high."
