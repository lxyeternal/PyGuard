      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, with suspicious comments and silent error handling, strongly indicating malicious activity. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant."
