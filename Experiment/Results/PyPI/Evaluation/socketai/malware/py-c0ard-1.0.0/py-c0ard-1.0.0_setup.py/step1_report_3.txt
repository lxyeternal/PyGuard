{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'py-c0ard' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports from 'requests' and 'fernet', and executes decrypted code using exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes decrypted code, which could be malicious if the decryption key or content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The decrypted Fernet-encrypted string is decrypted and executed during installation if OS is Windows, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time is suspicious. The long, nonsensical description strings are also suspicious, possibly obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation on Windows systems, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. The Fernet key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, which suggests potential malicious intent or backdoor. The execution of decrypted code during install poses a significant security risk. Other parts of the code are standard setup procedures. The obfuscation of description fields and the encrypted payload indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script includes a likely malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems, representing a high security risk. The hardcoded encrypted payload and key are suspicious, and this setup script should not be trusted without further analysis of the decrypted code.",
