{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step involving decryption and execution of code.",
  "sources": "os.name, os module; hardcoded Fernet decryption key and encrypted data; imported modules 'requests' and 'fernet'; potential dynamic code execution via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code; import statements for 'requests' and 'fernet'; network modules indirectly involved via imported modules; possible data exfiltration or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Decryption of data using Fernet -> execution of decrypted code via exec() when on Windows -> use of imported modules 'requests' and 'fernet' during install.",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed at installation time; use of exec() with decrypted code; inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' modules only during Windows OS; presence of large, nonsensical description strings indicating obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts a payload with Fernet and executes it. The payload is hidden within an encrypted string, suggesting obfuscation. The code dynamically runs potentially malicious code during installation, which can be used for malicious activities such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation. The use of 'exec()' with decrypted data is a significant security concern. The presence of encrypted data and selective execution on Windows indicates intent to evade detection. The rest of the setup configuration appears normal, but the malicious behavior is centered around the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during package installation, primarily on Windows. The use of encrypted payload and exec() indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity, representing a significant security risk.",
