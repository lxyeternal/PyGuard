{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that includes decrypting and executing encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name, os module, requests module, Fernet key and encrypted payload within the run method",
  "sinks": "exec function executing decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code received from decrypted payload",
  "flows": "os.name check → import requests and Fernet → decrypt payload → execute decrypted code via exec",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Fernet encryption key and encrypted payload; dynamic code execution via exec with decrypted content; import of external modules during install",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install command 'GruppeInstall'. During installation on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted string using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code with exec. The encrypted payload and key are hardcoded, indicating intentional concealment of malicious or arbitrary code. The use of exec on decrypted data poses a high risk, as this allows execution of arbitrary code embedded within the encrypted payload. This pattern suggests potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts at install time. The code does not perform any validation or checksum verification on the decrypted content, increasing the risk of malicious code execution. Overall, the code appears designed to execute concealed code during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains a high-risk mechanism where encrypted code is decrypted and executed during installation, indicating malicious intent. The hardcoded encryption key and payload strongly suggest malicious or unauthorized behavior, which could lead to system compromise or remote code execution.",
