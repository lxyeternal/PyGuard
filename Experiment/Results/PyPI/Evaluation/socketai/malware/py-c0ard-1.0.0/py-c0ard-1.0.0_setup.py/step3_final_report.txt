{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a static Fernet key and executes it during installation if on Windows, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted string and the static Fernet key within the run() method, and the conditional check for os.name == 'nt'.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decrypted payload, which could perform arbitrary malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads the encrypted payload and key, decrypts the payload, then executes it via exec(), all during the install process on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encrypted payload and key, conditional execution only on Windows, and execution of decrypted code during setup, indicating obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a conditional import of requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded payload with a static key, and executes it via exec() during installation on Windows. The encrypted payload and description strings are nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks or backdoors. The high confidence in malicious behavior is justified by the dynamic code execution, encrypted payload, and static key. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9) are consistent with this behavior. No false assumptions are evident; the pattern strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious activity, involving encrypted payload decryption and execution during package installation, with obfuscation tactics employed. It should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting removal or thorough analysis before use.",
