      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and demonstrates behaviors typical of malicious code. It interacts with system components, installs packages, creates shortcuts, and performs filesystem modifications covertly. Given these indicators, it should be classified as malware with maximum confidence. It poses a severe security threat and must be avoided, thoroughly analyzed in a secure environment, and flagged for removal from any supply chain."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows no definitive malicious activity, with minor obfuscation and complexity that do not warrant high malware or risk scores. The overall security posture is low risk, and the reports' scoring is consistent with their analyses. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
