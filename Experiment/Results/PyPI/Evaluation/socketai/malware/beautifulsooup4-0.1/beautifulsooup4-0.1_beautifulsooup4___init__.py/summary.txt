  "malware_score": 0.1,
  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no definitive malicious activity, with minor obfuscation and complexity that do not warrant high malware or risk scores. The overall security posture is low risk, and the reports' scoring is consistent with their analyses. Slight score adjustments improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
