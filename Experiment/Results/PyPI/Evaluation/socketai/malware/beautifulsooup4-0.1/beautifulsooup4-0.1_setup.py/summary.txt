  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and demonstrates behaviors typical of malicious code. It interacts with system components, installs packages, creates shortcuts, and performs filesystem modifications covertly. Given these indicators, it should be classified as malware with maximum confidence. It poses a severe security threat and must be avoided, thoroughly analyzed in a secure environment, and flagged for removal from any supply chain."
