  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell payloads during package setup. The silent error handling and conditional execution reinforce the likelihood of malicious activity. Without decoding the payload, definitive confirmation isn't possible, but the pattern warrants high alert and further analysis."
