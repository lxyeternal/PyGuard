  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, with indicators pointing toward malicious intent. The silent error handling and suspicious URL comment further increase concern. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified; I would elevate malware and risk scores slightly given the evidence. The package appears to be a vector for malicious payloads or system compromise, warranting caution and further investigation."
