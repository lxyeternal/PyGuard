  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and error suppression justify high malware and security risk scores. Further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence suggests a significant security concern."
