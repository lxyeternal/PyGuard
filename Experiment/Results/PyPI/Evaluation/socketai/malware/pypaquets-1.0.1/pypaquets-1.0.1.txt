      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the absence or suspicion of malicious activity. For reports indicating suspicion, scores are appropriate but could be slightly lowered or raised depending on evidence strength. Without concrete code, these evaluations remain pattern-based. The overall security risk remains moderate, aligning with the suspicion levels described."
