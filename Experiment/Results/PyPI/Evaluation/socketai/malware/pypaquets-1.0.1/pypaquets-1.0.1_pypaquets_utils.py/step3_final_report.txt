  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user inputs, or external data flows; specific code snippets or functions that read or process data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security-impacting functions such as eval(), system calls, network transmissions, or file operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system calls), indicating potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs like dynamic code execution, backdoors, or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis indicates no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors across all provided reports. In cases where no code is available, the assessments appropriately acknowledge the lack of evidence. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.2—are consistent with the evidence, with confidence levels reflecting the amount of information. For reports lacking code, a security risk score of 0.0 is more precise than 0.2, given the absence of any suspicious activity. Overall, the evaluations are justified and align with best practices for supply chain security review.",
  "conclusion": "The reviewed reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and obfuscation, with low security risk scores appropriate to the limited or absent evidence. No modifications are necessary; the assessments are consistent and conservative, indicating the dependency is benign based on current analysis.",
