  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing, possibly involving user input or external data sources, but the specific intent is unclear due to limited context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files (if any such lines are present). Specific sources are not detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions such as print statements, file writes, network calls, or subprocess executions, which could lead to data leaks or unintended actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like output functions or network calls, passing through intermediate variables and processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspects include any hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious import statements. Since the code content is not provided, no specific anomalies are identified.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of actual code content. Based on standard review procedures, key areas to scrutinize include input handling, output destinations, external network connections, and use of dynamic execution. Without specific code lines, it's impossible to definitively identify malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and typical code review procedures, no definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. However, without detailed code, low confidence remains, and a thorough review of the actual code is recommended.",
