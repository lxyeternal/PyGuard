  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly present; no data output, file writing, network connections, or sensitive operations are apparent.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks, as no input or output operations are shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet provided is empty; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is empty or non-existent, making a thorough analysis impossible. Without actual code, no sources, sinks, or flows can be identified. The absence of code prevents any detection of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code to analyze, so no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be identified. The empty snippet indicates a need for actual code content for a proper review.",
