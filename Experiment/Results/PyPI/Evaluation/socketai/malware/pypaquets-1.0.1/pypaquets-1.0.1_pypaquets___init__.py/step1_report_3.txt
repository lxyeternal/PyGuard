{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions within a larger application. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially from files or network sources if present, but specifics are not provided in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to variables, returns values, and may write to files or network sockets if such code exists elsewhere. No explicit sinks are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly leading to outputs or network/file operations outside the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior is observed. The code structure appears normal; however, without full context, some dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors cannot be entirely ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical security issues: no hardcoded secrets, no evident injection points, and no suspicious network or system calls are visible in this snippet. It appears to be standard Python code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Since the provided code is minimal and does not include external calls or data leaks, there is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior. The overall structure does not indicate malicious intent, but full assessment depends on the complete code and context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks. Confidence in this assessment is high, but limited by the fragmentary nature of the provided code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
