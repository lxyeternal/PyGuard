  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a placeholder or a template for code review rather than an executable script. No functional code is present.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read or accessed in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only whitespace and formatting characters with no logic, variables, functions, or operations. No anomalies are detected due to absence of executable code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty, consisting solely of whitespace characters, which indicates it does not perform any operations, read data, or interact with external systems. Without any functional code, there are no risks, anomalies, or malicious behaviors to evaluate. This suggests either an incomplete snippet or a placeholder without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious activities. It appears to be an empty or placeholder file with no malicious behavior or security risks. Therefore, the malware score is 0, the security risk score is 0, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
