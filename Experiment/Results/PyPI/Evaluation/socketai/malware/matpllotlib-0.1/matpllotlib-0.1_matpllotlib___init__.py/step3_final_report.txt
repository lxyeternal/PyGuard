  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points, obfuscated code segments, network communication functions, data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, eval/exec calls, file system modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as dynamic code execution or data input flow into sinks like network send functions or eval/exec statements.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution without clear validation, indirect data flows, hardcoded patterns suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious or suspicious code but are also used in legitimate complex applications. No concrete malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and dynamic code features. The scores reflect this cautious suspicion, with low malware likelihood but notable obfuscation. The absence of code in some reports limits definitive conclusions. Overall, the code appears benign in most cases, with some suspicion in report 1 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code, with the exception of report 1, which shows obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns but no confirmed malicious activity. The adjusted scores better reflect the evidence: malware at 0.1, obfuscation at 0.6, and moderate security risk at 0.5, aligning with the suspicion level without overestimating threat.",
