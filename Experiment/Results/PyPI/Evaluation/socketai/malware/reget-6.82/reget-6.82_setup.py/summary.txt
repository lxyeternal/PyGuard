  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion for malicious activity due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution during package setup. The pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or backdoors. Scores are consistent with high risk, warranting caution and further analysis of the payload. It is advisable to treat this package as potentially malicious until payload decoding confirms safety."
