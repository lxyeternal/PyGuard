  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through covert system info exfiltration during package installation, posing a significant security and privacy risk. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend slightly increasing the malware and risk scores to 0.85 and 0.9 respectively for a more conservative and accurate assessment."
