  "purpose": "Package setup script that customizes installation behavior to collect system information and send it to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "socket, getpass, os, requests modules; socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits system information to an external URL",
  "flows": "Information collected from system modules (hostname, fqdn, IP address, username) flows into the requests.get() request as URL parameters, transmitting data to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system info and sends it automatically during package installation without user consent; the URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and unrelated to package functionality; no user prompts or logs are present",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process by adding a custom install command that collects hostname, FQDN, IP address, current working directory, and username. These data points are then sent via a GET request to an external server, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance. There are no signs of obfuscation or typical malware payloads like code injection, data theft beyond system info, or backdoors. The remote URL suggests a possible command-and-control or data collection server, which is suspicious. The code executes during installation, which can be considered an unanticipated behavior for typical package distribution, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data exfiltration during package installation. It does not perform any harmful actions directly on the user's system but secretly transmits system info to an external server, which is suspicious and could be part of a supply chain attack or tracking mechanism. The overall behavior indicates a high security risk.",
