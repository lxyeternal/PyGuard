  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, fqdn, IP address, username → requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly gathers detailed system info and exfiltrates it without user consent, hidden within the installation process. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a third-party 'requests' library. It defines a custom installation class that, upon running, collects hostname, fully qualified domain name, IP address, current working directory, and username. It then sends these details via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. The data exfiltration occurs transparently during package installation, with no user awareness or consent. This behavior resembles clandestine data collection or a backdoor mechanism. The URL is hardcoded and appears malicious or at least suspicious, possibly used for tracking or data theft. No other malicious code or obfuscated content is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs clandestine data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server without user knowledge. This is a clear security concern and constitutes malicious behavior.",
