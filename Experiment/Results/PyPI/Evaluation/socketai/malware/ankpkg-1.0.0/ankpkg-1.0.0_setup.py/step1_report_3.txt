{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up a Python package with a custom installation step that gathers system information and sends it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information including hostname, current working directory, username, fully qualified domain name, and IP address.",
  "sinks": "The external URL request (requests.get) sends the collected data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "The system info is collected from socket, os, and getpass, then transmitted via requests.get to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent during package installation. The target URL is suspicious and resembles a potentially malicious or tracking domain. No user notification or consent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, collects system information such as hostname, current directory, user name, FQDN, and IP address. Immediately after, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. The URL appears suspicious, possibly used for tracking or malicious data collection. There are no input validation, obfuscation, or user prompts; this behavior is embedded silently in the installation process. Such behavior can be considered malicious or at least privacy-invasive, as it gathers and transmits system info without user awareness. The rest of the setup code is standard, but the hidden data exfiltration is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains hidden data collection and transmission during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It appears designed to collect system info surreptitiously, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation.",
