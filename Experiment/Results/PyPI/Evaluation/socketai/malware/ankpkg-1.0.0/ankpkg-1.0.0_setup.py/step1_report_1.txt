{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), socket.getfqdn(), socket.gethostbyname(), socket.gethostbyaddr(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL with system information as URL parameters",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources flows through the 'ploads' dictionary and is sent via HTTP GET request to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code silently transmits detailed system information to an external domain without user consent or notification. The target URL appears suspicious, and the code executes during package installation, which is unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for system info and network communication. It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method to gather hostname, FQDN, IP address, current working directory, and username. These details are stored in a dictionary and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. No user prompts or logs indicate transparency. The data exfiltration occurs silently during package installation, which is atypical and potentially malicious behavior. The target URL is suspicious and possibly controlled by an attacker or malicious entity, indicating possible data theft or surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system details during package installation to an untrusted external server, which is malicious behavior. The script could be part of a supply chain attack aiming to gather environment information for further malicious activities.",
