{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and extend the installation process to collect system information and send it to a specified external URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, fully qualified domain name, IP address, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System information is collected from various system calls and then transmitted through an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits detailed system information to an external URL during installation without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL is obscure and could be used for malicious data collection or command-and-control.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation command to perform additional actions during package installation. It gathers hostname, FQDN, IP address, current working directory, and username. Instead of merely installing, it sends this information via a GET request to a suspicious URL, which could be used for malicious tracking, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded external URL without user consent is suspicious. No malicious payloads or harmful actions are evident beyond data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads like reverse shells or damaging commands, but the hidden data transmission during install raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious data exfiltration by sending system info to an external server during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The intent appears to be tracking or reconnaissance rather than benign setup, indicating a security risk.",
