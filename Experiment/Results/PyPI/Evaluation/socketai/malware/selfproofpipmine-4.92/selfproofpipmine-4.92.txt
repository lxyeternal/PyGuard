      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear signs of malicious activity through obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The embedded payload, URL comment, and silent error handling increase the likelihood of malicious intent. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation 0.8, and security risk 0.9 to reflect the high threat level."
