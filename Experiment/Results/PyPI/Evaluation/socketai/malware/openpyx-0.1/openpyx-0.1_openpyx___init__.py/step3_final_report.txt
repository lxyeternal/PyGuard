  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network requests, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing functions, API calls, or network modules.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of the code snippets. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0 or 0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed or inferred. The assessments are cautious, accurate, and justified based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are either empty or benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores and confidence levels are appropriate and consistent. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
