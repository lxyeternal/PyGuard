  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks are evident, such as network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from external sources to sinks is present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears empty or uninitialized, with no apparent logic, functions, or data handling. Lack of code may indicate an incomplete snippet or an intentional placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or contains no operational logic. Without actual code, there are no source-to-sink flows, no anomalous behavior, or malicious patterns. The absence of code prevents any meaningful assessment, but also indicates no apparent malicious intent or security issues present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be either incomplete or a placeholder with no executable logic. Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Confidence in this assessment is high due to lack of content.",
