      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily due to obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, combined with external references and error suppression. While definitive confirmation requires decoding the payload, the current indicators justify high malware and security risk scores. It should be treated as potentially malicious and investigated further."
