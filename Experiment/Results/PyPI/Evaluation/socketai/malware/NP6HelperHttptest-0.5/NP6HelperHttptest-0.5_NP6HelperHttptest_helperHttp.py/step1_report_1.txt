  "purpose": "Helper function to analyze HTTP headers by checking if a specified MIME type is present.",
  "sources": "The 'header' parameter is read as input, which is expected to be a string containing HTTP header values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; the function only performs string analysis.",
  "flows": "Input 'header' is processed to determine if it contains the specified MIME type, with no external data flows or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The function returns True if the header is empty or contains the MIME type, which may lead to logical errors, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to check the presence of a MIME type in a header string. It performs a simple string operation: stripping whitespace and splitting by semicolons. It returns True if the header is empty (which may be unintended) or if any value matches the MIME type exactly. There are no suspicious code patterns, external network interactions, or data leaks. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, used for header analysis in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility function for header analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It may have logical flaws regarding empty headers, but nothing malicious is present.",
