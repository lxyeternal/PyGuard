{
  "purpose": "A helper function to analyze whether an HTTP header contains a specific MIME type or is empty.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'header' which is a string representing the HTTP header; the 'mimeType' parameter used for comparison.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the function performs a simple string check without external calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function checks if 'header' is empty or contains a segment matching 'mimeType' after splitting on ';' and trimming whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "Returns True if the header is empty, which may be unintended; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check for MIME type presence in a header string, with no network or malicious activity. The main logical concern is that it returns True for empty headers, which could be a design flaw but not a security issue. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are present. The function's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with a minor logical flaw regarding empty headers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
