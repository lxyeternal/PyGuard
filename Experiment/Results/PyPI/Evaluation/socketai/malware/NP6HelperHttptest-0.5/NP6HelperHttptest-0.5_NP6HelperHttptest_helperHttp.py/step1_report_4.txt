{
  "purpose": "Helper function to analyze HTTP headers for a specific MIME type.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'header' parameter input, which is expected to be a string containing HTTP header values.",
  "sinks": "Uses the header data for comparison, potentially leading to logic errors if header is malformed, but no direct data leak or dangerous operation occurs.",
  "flows": "Input header string is processed and checked against the MIME type; no external or untrusted data is propagated elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The function returns true if header is empty or contains the MIME type, which is a straightforward check; no malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple validation of HTTP header content by checking if the header string is empty or contains a specified MIME type, splitting by ';' and trimming whitespace. It includes a docstring for clarity. No external network or system calls, no evaluation of untrusted data beyond string comparison, and no suspicious logic are present. The implementation appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple header analysis helper with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as intended for MIME type validation within HTTP headers.",
