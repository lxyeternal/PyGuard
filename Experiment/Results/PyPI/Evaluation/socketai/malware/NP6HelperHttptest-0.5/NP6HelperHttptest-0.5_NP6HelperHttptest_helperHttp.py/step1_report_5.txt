{
  "purpose": "Helper function to analyze HTTP headers, specifically to check if the header contains a certain MIME type.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'header' parameter, which is expected to be a string representing HTTP header values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations or data leaks; the function only reads input data.",
  "flows": "The header input flows through a strip() and split(';') operations, then is checked against a MIME type string.",
  "anomalies": "The function returns true if the header is empty or contains the specified MIME type; however, the use of 'len(header.strip()) == 0' combined with 'any()' may lead to unexpected behavior if header is empty or whitespace.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility to check header content for a specific MIME type, with handling for empty headers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. The logic is straightforward and does not process untrusted input beyond string checks. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and functions as a basic header analysis utility. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
