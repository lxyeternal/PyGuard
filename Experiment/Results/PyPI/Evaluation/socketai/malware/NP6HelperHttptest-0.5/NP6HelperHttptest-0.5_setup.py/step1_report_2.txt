{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process of a Python package to download and execute external files, potentially to install malicious components or backdoors.",
  "sources": "URL requests to https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe and https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to files and executing a .exe file via subprocess.Popen, which could run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "Download from URL (source) -> Save as 'ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll' in temporary directory (sink) -> Execute 'ComServer.exe' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading executables and DLLs from suspicious domains and executing downloaded files during package installation, which is atypical for legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command to include downloading two files from an external URL and executing one of them as a process. The URLs point to non-legitimate domains, and the downloaded files are executed immediately, which can be malicious behavior. This activity occurs during package installation, indicating an attempt to run arbitrary code, potentially for malicious purposes. The code structure and logic are straightforward but used here to hide malicious intent behind normal package setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external files during installation, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. It is highly suspicious and should be considered dangerous.",
