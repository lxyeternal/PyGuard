{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to download and execute additional files from a remote server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Remote URLs: https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe and https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll; reading URL content during install.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to local disk as executables and DLLs; executing the downloaded executable via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Download from URLs -> Save as files in temp directory -> Execute downloaded executable ('ComServer.exe') with argument 'showdeskband'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of code: automatic download and execution of remote files during installation; use of custom temp directory; active process creation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class 'ActionOnInstall' that overrides the run method. During installation, it fetches two files from suspicious URLs—one executable and one DLL—without any validation or user notification. It then writes these files to a temporary directory and executes the executable with a specific argument. This behavior resembles malware activity, such as downloading and executing remote code, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or persistence. No legitimate use case is apparent, and the URLs indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote files during package installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. This behavior poses significant security risks and should be considered unsafe for use.",
