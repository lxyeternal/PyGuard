  "purpose": "Customize installation process to download and execute remote files during package installation.",
  "sources": "URL requests to 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'; reading from the internet during the install process.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to disk as 'ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll'; executing 'ComServer.exe' with subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Download files from remote URLs -> Save files to temporary directory -> Execute 'ComServer.exe' which was downloaded from external source.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of downloading and executing a file during package installation, which is not typical for setup scripts. Use of external URLs for executable and DLL files. No validation or verification of downloaded content. The URL domain appears suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional steps during package installation. It fetches two files from external URLs, saves them in a temporary directory, and executes one of the files as a process. This behavior can be used to silently install malicious payloads or backdoors onto the target system. The code lacks any validation, checksum verification, or user consent prompts. The external URLs are suspicious and could host malware. The execution of downloaded files indicates potentially malicious intent, especially as the files are executed immediately after download without checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs malicious activities by downloading and executing remote files during installation, representing a high security risk. It appears designed to compromise systems by installing and running potentially harmful executables without user knowledge or consent.",
