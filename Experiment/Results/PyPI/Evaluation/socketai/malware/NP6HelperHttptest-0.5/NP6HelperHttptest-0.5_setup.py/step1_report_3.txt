  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute potentially malicious files during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external URLs: 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'.",
  "sinks": "Downloaded files are written to the temporary directory and then executed or loaded, specifically executing 'ComServer.exe'.",
  "flows": "Data is fetched from external URLs (sources), saved as files, and then the executable file is run, creating a source-to-sink flow that executes remote content.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic download and execution of files from suspicious domains during package install. The URLs are malicious-looking, and the code executes downloaded executable files without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon running, downloads a '.exe' and a '.dll' from a suspicious domain. It then saves these files in a temporary directory with generic names and executes the '.exe' file with an argument. This behavior is atypical for a package setup and indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors or malware. The domain 'rngupdatem.buzz' is suspicious and likely malicious. The code executes external files immediately, bypassing user consent and validation. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' to run downloaded content is a critical security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external malicious files during installation. It actively performs malicious activities, indicating a high risk of malware or backdoor installation. This code should not be used or trusted.",
