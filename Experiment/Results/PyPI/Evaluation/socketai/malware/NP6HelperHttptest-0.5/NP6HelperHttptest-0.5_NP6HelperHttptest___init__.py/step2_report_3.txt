  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .helperHttp import content_type`.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited are present in the snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is a benign import statement.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and standard is justified.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n   - The minimal security risk score (0.1) in report 2 is acceptable, considering it might be a cautious estimate, but even that could be lowered to 0 given the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or malicious imports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a simple import.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: low or zero for malware and security risk, high confidence, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — the snippet alone poses no security threat.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, but given the simplicity, the risk and malware scores should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** While this snippet is benign, always consider the broader context of the codebase for comprehensive security assessment.",
