  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .helperHttp import content_type\n```\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward import statement.\n- No data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code alone does not indicate any malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Importing 'content_type' from a local module.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that this is a simple import with no apparent issues.\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (justified)\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Also correctly states this is a benign import, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 seems slightly high for such a benign import; perhaps 0.0 would be more appropriate unless there's additional context.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Suggestion:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as no security concern is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that this is a standard import with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a benign import statement.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately describes the import as straightforward, with no suspicious elements.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The securityRisk scores are mostly zero, except for one report (Report 2) which assigns 0.1; given the benign nature, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk based on this snippet alone)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard import statement, and none of the reports indicate any actual security concern. The scores should reflect the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code, this import statement alone does not pose any threat.",
