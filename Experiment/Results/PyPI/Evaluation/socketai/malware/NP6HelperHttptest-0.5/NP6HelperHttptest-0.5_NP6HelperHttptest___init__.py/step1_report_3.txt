  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink pathways evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Python module imports; no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only contains an import statement from a relative module. It does not process any data, execute code dynamically, or perform actions that could be malicious. As such, it appears to be a simple import with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical module import, unlikely to be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
