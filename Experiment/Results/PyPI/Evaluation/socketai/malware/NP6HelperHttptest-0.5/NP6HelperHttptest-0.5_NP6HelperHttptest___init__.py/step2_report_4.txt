  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code is just a simple import statement with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior is evident; the assessment is accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a straightforward import with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — the small securityRisk score is acceptable given the minimal context, but perhaps slightly overstated since the code is benign.  \n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the minor securityRisk could be due to the import of potentially sensitive components, but without context, it's negligible.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly less than perfect confidence is acceptable, but no issues are present.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — reasonable.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; a simple import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally very low, reflecting the minimal code.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The security risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or data flow.  \n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.  \n\n### My own estimate:  \n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 at most, possibly 0, since the code is trivial and benign.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate, given the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet. No further action or concern is necessary based solely on these import statements.",
