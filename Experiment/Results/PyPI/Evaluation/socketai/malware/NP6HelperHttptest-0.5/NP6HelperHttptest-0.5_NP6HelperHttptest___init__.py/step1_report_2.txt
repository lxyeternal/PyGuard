{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific object or function named 'content_type' from a module called 'helperHttp' in the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'helperHttp'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions are shown.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports a module component without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a standard import statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement, which is common in Python for modular code organization. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or other operations. Since it only imports a specific component, there is no immediate risk or suspicious behavior. No sources or sinks related to untrusted data are evident. The imported component 'content_type' may be used elsewhere in the larger project, but this snippet alone does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears benign and typical for modular Python code.",
