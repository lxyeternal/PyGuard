  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a static import with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing 'content_type' from a local module. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The import is standard and does not involve any data processing or network communication. The minimal code snippet indicates benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and very low security risk scores. Slight adjustments could be made to lower the security risk score from 0.1 to 0, as no risk is evident. Confidence in benign assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate; scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
