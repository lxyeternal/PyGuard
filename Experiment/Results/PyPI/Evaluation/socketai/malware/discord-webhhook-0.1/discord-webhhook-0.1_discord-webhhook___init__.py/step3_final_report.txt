  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, data flows over network or files, dynamic eval usage, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication points, file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input functions flow into eval or network transmission functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (0.7), use of eval, dynamic addresses, lack of concrete payloads, empty code snippets, or no code provided.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic eval usage, which are common indicators of suspicious or malicious intent. The presence of obfuscation (score 0.7) aligns with the suspicion. The malware likelihood (score 0.3) is moderate, justified by patterns like eval and potential network activity, but no concrete malicious payloads are confirmed. Absence of code or empty snippets in some reports prevents further analysis, leading to zero scores. Overall, the risk score (around 0.5) reflects moderate concern due to obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns. The scores are consistent with the described anomalies and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the obfuscation and eval usage in Report 1, which justify moderate suspicion and risk. Other reports lack code or suspicious patterns, resulting in low or zero scores. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary unless more detailed code is provided.",
