  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the obfuscation and eval usage in Report 1, which justify moderate suspicion and risk. Other reports lack code or suspicious patterns, resulting in low or zero scores. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary unless more detailed code is provided."
