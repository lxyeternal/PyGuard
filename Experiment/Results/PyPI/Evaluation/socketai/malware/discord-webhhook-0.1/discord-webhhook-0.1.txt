      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and performs system modifications, package installations, and privilege checks indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation level and system interactions justify a malware score of 0.95, a security risk score of 0.9, and confirm its malicious potential. It should be treated as malware and avoided in any deployment scenario."

      "conclusion": "The primary concern is the obfuscation and eval usage in Report 1, which justify moderate suspicion and risk. Other reports lack code or suspicious patterns, resulting in low or zero scores. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no further adjustments are necessary unless more detailed code is provided."
