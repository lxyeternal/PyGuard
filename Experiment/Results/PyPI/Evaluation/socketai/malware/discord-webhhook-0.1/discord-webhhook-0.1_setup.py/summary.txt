  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and performs system modifications, package installations, and privilege checks indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation level and system interactions justify a malware score of 0.95, a security risk score of 0.9, and confirm its malicious potential. It should be treated as malware and avoided in any deployment scenario."
