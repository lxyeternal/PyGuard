      "conclusion": "The code contains a conditional, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed stealthily when a specific directory is missing. The encoded command and suspicious URL indicate malicious intent, likely involving remote payload download or execution. The high scores and analysis confirm the malicious nature, and the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious."
