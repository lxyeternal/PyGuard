  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() – gathering hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() – sending collected data to external URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, username flows directly into the requests.get() call which transmits data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects and transmits system information without user consent during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL used for data exfiltration is suspicious, and the operation occurs in the run() method of a custom install class, which is atypical for legitimate package installs.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external server, transmitting this information as URL parameters. This behavior is hidden within the package installation process, which is not standard for legitimate packages. The data exfiltration appears intended to collect system info covertly, indicating malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The URL used is a known domain used for command and control or data collection. No other malicious code, such as system modification or payload execution, is present, but the behavior itself is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is a malicious or at least highly suspicious activity. It violates typical security practices and could be used for tracking or information theft. The overall security risk is high.",
