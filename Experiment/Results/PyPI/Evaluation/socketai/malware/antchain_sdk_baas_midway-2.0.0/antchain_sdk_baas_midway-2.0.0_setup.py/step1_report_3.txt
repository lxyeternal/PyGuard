{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package named 'antchain_sdk_baas_midway' with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, the script gathers hostname, cwd, and username, then transmits this data to an external server over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes network communication that occurs automatically during installation without user consent, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. The target URL appears suspicious and is known for DNS-based command and control or data exfiltration. Use of hardcoded URL and transmission of system info without clear necessity is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process with a custom command 'CustomInstall' that, after performing the usual installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are then sent via a GET request to an external server. The external server's URL (5r13v9.ceye.io) is known in security contexts for DNS-based data exfiltration or command-and-control activities. The data transmission occurs silently during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. No other malicious code, such as payload execution or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be designed for data collection without user awareness, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior involving data exfiltration during package installation, targeting a known malicious or testing domain. This behavior suggests malicious intent, such as user tracking or data theft, embedded in a seemingly benign setup script.",
