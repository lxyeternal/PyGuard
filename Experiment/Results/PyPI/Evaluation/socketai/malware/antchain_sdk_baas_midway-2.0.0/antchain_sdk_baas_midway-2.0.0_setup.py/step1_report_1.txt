  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Imports (requests, socket, getpass, os), socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external URL with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network request during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. No obvious use of obfuscation or benign purpose for such data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class inheriting from setuptools' install. During the run method, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends these details to a specific URL. This behavior occurs every time the package is installed, without any user consent prompt. Such data exfiltration during package installation indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious activity, especially in the context of supply chain attacks. No other malicious behaviors like code execution, backdoors, or data theft are observed beyond this network call.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, which is a security risk. This is indicative of malicious intent or a supply chain attack component. The code's primary purpose appears to be data collection without user awareness.",
