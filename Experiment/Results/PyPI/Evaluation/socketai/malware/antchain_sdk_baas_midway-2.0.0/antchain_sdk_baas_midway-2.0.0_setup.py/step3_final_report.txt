{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup process that, during installation, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious data collection activity.",
  "sources": "The system information is gathered from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends the collected data to an external URL, which acts as the sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the source functions (hostname, cwd, username) to the requests.get() call, which transmits the data to the external server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an automatic, silent network request during installation without user notification, and the URL used is suspicious and associated with command-and-control or data exfiltration activities. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a covert data exfiltration during package installation by collecting system info and sending it to a known malicious domain. The network request is unusual for setup scripts and indicates malicious intent. The code is clear and not obfuscated, with no other malicious behaviors present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this activity. Given the severity of silent data exfiltration, the activity warrants a high malware and security risk score. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, making it highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the activity poses a serious security risk. The activity should be considered malicious, and the package should not be trusted or used.",
