{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with custom installation behavior that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket (hostname), os (current working directory), and getpass (username).",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via requests.get() to a remote server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, transmitting untrusted system information to an external server during install.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system information silently during installation and exfiltrates it to an external server without user consent. The URL used appears suspicious and intended for command and control or data collection purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running, collects system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to a remote URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is hidden within the setup process, potentially violating user privacy and executing unintended network communication during package installation. The URL used resembles a known command-and-control or data exfiltration server. There are no input validation, no user prompts, and the code executes automatically upon install, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a remote server during package installation without user consent. This represents a significant security risk, potentially used for tracking or data theft.",
