  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Read system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "Send collected data via HTTP GET request to external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During install, gather hostname, cwd, username → send data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded external network request in setup script, collecting system info without user consent; use of hardcoded URL; no indication of user notification or permission.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py overrides the install command to include a network request that transmits hostname, current directory, and username to an external server during package installation. This behavior is unusual for typical setup scripts, which normally only handle package configuration. The external request appears to be used for tracking or data collection without informing the user. The URL used (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) suggests potential for malicious or surveillance intent, as it does not relate to the package functionality. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as code injection, privilege escalation, or backdoors, is detected. The code appears intentionally designed to collect system info stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to an external server during package installation, which is a security concern. This behavior suggests potential privacy violation or malicious tracking. The overall security risk is high due to unexpected data exfiltration during normal package setup.",
