  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other user data from browsers, Discord, and other applications, then upload this data to remote servers via HTTP requests. It also includes functionality for zipping files and folders, potentially for exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser profile directories, Discord data folders, local SQLite databases (Login Data, Cookies), and local state files. It also reads input from user files and memory dumps within specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows to remote servers via HTTP POST requests to various URLs (e.g., Gofile, Anonfiles, Telegram API). Data is also written into files and compressed into ZIP archives before uploading. Data extracted includes tokens, passwords, cookies, and other user information.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser databases and Discord files are read and processed to extract tokens, credentials, and cookies. These are then formatted and sent to remote servers via HTTP POST requests. Files and directories are zipped and uploaded, with URLs collected for reporting.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Discord webhook token and chat ID, potentially malicious. Use of threading for concurrent data collection. Extensive collection of sensitive data (tokens, cookies, passwords) with no user consent indication. Function names and variables suggest theft of user data. Use of subprocess to kill processes and delete files may indicate sabotage or obfuscation techniques. The code’s primary purpose appears to be stealthy data theft.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively interacts with user directories, browser data, Discord, and other applications to harvest sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal data. It employs multiple threads for concurrent operations, including zipping files and uploading data. Hardcoded credentials and webhooks are present, facilitating remote exfiltration. Functions for decrypting stored browser data use Windows API calls, indicating knowledge of Windows-specific data protection. The code manipulates, compresses, and uploads stolen data, indicative of malicious intent. Its structure and actions strongly suggest malware functionality designed for stealth and data theft, with obfuscation signs such as process termination and file deletion, as well as extensive data harvesting routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, acting as info-stealer malware aimed at harvesting user credentials, tokens, cookies, and other personal data from browsers, Discord, and other applications. It exfiltrates data via HTTP requests to third-party servers, with hardcoded webhook and chat ID indicating controlled remote access. Its design includes process termination and file manipulation, typical of malware aimed at evading detection. Overall, the code poses a severe security threat and should be considered malicious.",
