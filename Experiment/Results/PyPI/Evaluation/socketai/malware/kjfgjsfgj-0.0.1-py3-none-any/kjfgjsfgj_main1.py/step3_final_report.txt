{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious info-stealer targeting browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications. It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, billing info, and files, then exfiltrates data via Telegram and file hosting services, while terminating security-related processes to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Browser directories (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Yandex), Discord, Steam directories, local database files (Login Data, Cookies, Local State), logs, and regex patterns for tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Telegram API, uploads to anonfiles and gofile, process termination commands (taskkill), decryption routines (Windows API and AES), and file zipping for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Code reads data from source directories/files, decrypts stored credentials, formats data, then sends via requests to Telegram and uploads files to external hosts, often using threading for concurrency.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, silent installation of dependencies, process termination commands, complex threading, and minimal obfuscation in variable names, indicating stealth intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data collection from browsers, Discord, and Steam, decrypts stored credentials using Windows API calls, and exfiltrates data via Telegram and file uploads. It terminates related processes to prevent interference, installs dependencies silently, and employs threading for efficiency. The presence of hardcoded tokens and process-killing commands confirms malicious intent. The code structure is relatively straightforward with minor obfuscation, and all behaviors align with typical malware profiles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious info-stealer designed for data theft, exfiltration, and system sabotage. It exhibits clear malicious behaviors with no benign functionality. The malware score is set to 1.0, obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and overall security risk is maximum (1.0). It should be classified as a severe threat and flagged accordingly.",
