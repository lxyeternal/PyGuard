{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed to extract, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data from various browsers, applications, and system files, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then upload this information to external servers and services such as Telegram and anonymous file hosts.",
  "sources": "Reading input/data from browser profile directories, log files, login databases, local state files, and system directories; extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and files; network requests for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via Telegram API requests, uploading files to anonymous file hosting services, making HTTP POST requests to external servers with collected data, executing subprocess commands for process termination and file zipping.",
  "flows": "Source data (browser/local files, token regex matches, login/password DBs) -> Decryption/processing (decrypts tokens, passwords, cookies) -> Data aggregation and formatting -> Exfiltration (requests to Telegram, file uploads, URL requests).",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token, extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection, repeated attempts to install libraries silently, copying and encrypting/decrypting system and browser data, terminating processes forcefully, untrusted external requests, potential obfuscation in code structure, and the presence of functions like 'Trust' that flag suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a comprehensive info-stealer, targeting browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Brave, Yandex), Discord, Steam, and other applications to extract tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, and files. It decrypts stored data, gathers information via regex, and exfiltrates it via Telegram and anonymous file hosts. It also zips and uploads specific files, indicating intent to exfiltrate user data and system files. The presence of hardcoded tokens, obfuscated variable naming, and process-killing commands suggest malicious intent. The script is designed for stealth, parallel execution, and persistence in gathering sensitive user information.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious info-stealer designed to harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, billing info, and files from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates data via Telegram and file hosting services, employs multiple stealth and sabotage techniques, and is highly suspicious. Its structure and behavior confirm malicious intent with high confidence.",
