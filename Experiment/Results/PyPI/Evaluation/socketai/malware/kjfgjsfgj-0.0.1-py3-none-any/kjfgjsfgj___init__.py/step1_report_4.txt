  "purpose": "Import the 'main' module from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a local module",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data or untrusted input is processed or output",
  "flows": "No data flow observed; import statement alone does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Single import statement, minimal code, no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a module named 'main' from the same package. This is a standard Python import, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No source-to-sink data flow or handling of untrusted input is present. Given the minimal code, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
