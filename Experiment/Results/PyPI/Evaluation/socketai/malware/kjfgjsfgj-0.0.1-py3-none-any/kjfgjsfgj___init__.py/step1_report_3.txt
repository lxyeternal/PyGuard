  "purpose": "Import the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself is not a sink; it simply loads a module.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain any data flows; it only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement, which loads a module named 'main' from the current package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration. The code is minimal and standard in structure, providing no indicators of malicious intent. Since this is only an import statement, it does not pose any security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs a standard operation of importing a module within a package.",
