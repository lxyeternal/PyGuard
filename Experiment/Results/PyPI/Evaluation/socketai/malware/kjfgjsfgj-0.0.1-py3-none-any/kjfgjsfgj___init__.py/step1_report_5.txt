  "purpose": "Import the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing the current package's 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only an import statement and no additional logic, variables, or functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports the 'main' module relative to the current package. There are no visible data inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious actions. The absence of code beyond the import suggests a simple module dependency. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
