{
  "purpose": "Import the 'main' module from the current package, likely for initialization or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data inputs or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the 'main' module into the namespace; no data flow or execution flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward relative import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement, standard in Python packages. It does not involve data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The import is typical and benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in benignity is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard relative import with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly assess this, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
