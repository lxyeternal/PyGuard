  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement; no source-to-sink flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for package modules; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'main'. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no untrusted data handling. The snippet is a standard import statement with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is too minimal to infer malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The code is benign and typical for Python packages.",
