  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code is a single function:\n     ```python\n     def cli():\n         print(\"It Works\")\n     ```\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, static, and only outputs a message. There are no external inputs, dependencies, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly assess the code as harmless.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, malware score should remain 0.\n   - Security risk score should be 0, as there's no potential for harm.\n   - The code does not perform any obfuscation or suspicious behavior, so `obfuscated` remains 0.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they do not suggest any vulnerabilities based solely on this code.\n   - The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n7. **Consistency with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: In a real-world scenario, if the code were part of a larger dependency, further context might be needed. But based solely on this snippet and the reports, the current scores and analysis are appropriate.",
