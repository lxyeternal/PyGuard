  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'It Works'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or dependencies; static code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no external data or dependencies. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
