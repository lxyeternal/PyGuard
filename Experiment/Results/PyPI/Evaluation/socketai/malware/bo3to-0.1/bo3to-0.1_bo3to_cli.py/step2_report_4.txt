  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple function `cli()` that prints a static message.\n   - There are no external inputs, data processing, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and malware justification:**\n   - Since the code does not process data, read inputs, or perform any external communication, the risk is minimal.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The security risk is also correctly scored at 0.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about hidden malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary and my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the unanimous agreement across reports, I concur with the assigned scores. No further escalation or concern is warranted.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
