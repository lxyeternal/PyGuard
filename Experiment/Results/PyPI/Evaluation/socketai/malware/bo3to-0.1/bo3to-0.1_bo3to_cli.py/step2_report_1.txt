  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code, then evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a single function `cli()` that prints a static message \"It Works\".\n   - All reports confirm that there are no external inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, no external dependencies, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: all agree that the code is harmless, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - **Note:** The reports uniformly assign high confidence (1) and zero for obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware Score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Confidence:** All assign 1, indicating high certainty, which is reasonable.\n   - **Potential for Reconsideration:** Since the code is trivial and has no suspicious features, the scores seem appropriate and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is entirely benign.\n   - The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The security risk score is 0, reflecting no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion is evident.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a trivial, static print statement with no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- Keep confidence at 1, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
