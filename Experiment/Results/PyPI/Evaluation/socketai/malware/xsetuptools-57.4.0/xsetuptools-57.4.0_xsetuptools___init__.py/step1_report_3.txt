  "anomalies": [
    "Use of base64 encoding combined with hexadecimal encoding suggests an attempt to hide data.",
    "Sending data via ICMP ping with crafted domain names, which is unusual and suspicious.",
    "Multiple HTTP request libraries used inconsistently, possibly to evade detection.",
    "Embedding encoded system information into domain names and URLs, which is atypical for legitimate applications."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, current directory, and package info, then encodes this data with base64 and further hexadecimal encoding. It splits the data into parts, each sent as a DNS query-like domain name via ICMP 'ping' commands, and also transmits the data over HTTP using different libraries. The obfuscation of data, multi-channel communication (ICMP and HTTP), and the encoding techniques are typical of data exfiltration or command and control communications. The code does not perform any clear user-driven functionality and appears designed to covertly transmit system info to a remote server, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with covert data exfiltration and command and control communication, including data encoding, multi-channel transmission, and domain-based data hiding. These activities suggest malicious intent, such as stealthy data theft or remote control, with high suspicion of malicious behavior.",
