  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code, no obfuscation, no hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity. The package name 'xsetuptools' could be a mimicry attempt but is not malicious. The code is standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The package name may warrant minor scrutiny but does not pose a threat. Scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score reflecting minimal concern.",
