{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and browser information from a system, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks and file uploads to external servers, likely for malicious intent such as theft and unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), file reads (log, ldb, cookies, Local State files, Chrome/Firefox/Browser storage directories), and system directories for browsers and applications; network requests to IP geolocation and Discord API endpoints; and reading browser data files such as Login Data and Cookies.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into webhook URLs, requests to Discord API, and file uploads to third-party services (gofile.io, anonfiles). Data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and user info are sent over HTTP POST requests. Also, local data is compressed into zip files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system inputs (browser storage, system directories, environment variables) to data parsing functions, then to network functions that upload or send the data to remote servers via webhooks or file uploads. Extracted tokens and credentials are specifically gathered from browser databases and logs, then exfiltrated via HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URLs, obfuscated or misleading variable names, redundant imports, and suspicious file handling such as copying and removing browser storage files. It repeatedly attempts to bypass detection via obfuscation techniques like regex patterns that appear to strip common words. Functions like 'GatherZips' and 'ZipThings' actively zip and upload files, and there are indications of stealing browser credentials, cookies, and wallet data. Use of 'taskkill' commands to terminate processes before zipping files is suspicious. Repeatedly, data is collected from popular applications known for storing sensitive info (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Discord, Steam, Wallets).",
  "analysis": "The code is structured to systematically extract data from various applications and browsers, using system directories and database files. It retrieves tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information. It performs network requests to Discord API for user info and relationships, and geolocation data. It collects files related to wallets, gaming, and other applications, then compresses and uploads them to third-party servers. It also exfiltrates gathered data via webhooks with detailed embed messages. The code contains obfuscation hints, such as regex patterns targeting common words, and employs process termination commands to free files for zipping. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and multiple external requests suggest malicious intent, primarily data theft. The overall flow involves data collection, processing, zipping, and exfiltration with minimal user detection. No legitimate functionality or user-facing purpose is evident; all activities are geared toward unauthorized data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is clearly malicious, designed to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user data including tokens, passwords, cookies, wallet info, and browser data, using multiple techniques like database access, file copying, process termination, and external uploads. It targets popular applications and browsers to maximize data theft, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The code employs obfuscation and external communication channels, reinforcing its malicious nature.",
