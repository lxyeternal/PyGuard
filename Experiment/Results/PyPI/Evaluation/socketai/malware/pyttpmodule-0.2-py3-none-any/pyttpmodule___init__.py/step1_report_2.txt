{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, and files from the victim's system, then upload the data to external servers, primarily via Discord webhook and file upload services.",
  "sources": "URL requests to IP geolocation API, Discord API endpoints, local system files (e.g., login data, cookies, local state), environment variables, and file system directories containing browser, Discord, Telegram, and wallet data.",
  "sinks": "Web requests to webhooks and file upload endpoints, writing data to local files, executing shell commands (e.g., taskkill), and copying/deleting files from system directories.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (system files, environment variables, web requests) to sinks (webhook notifications, file uploads, system commands), often via functions that gather, decrypt, and then transmit sensitive data. For example, tokens extracted from logs or files are checked, then uploaded to a webhook, and system data like cookies or passwords are exfiltrated similarly.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation in code comments, variable names, and inconsistent formatting; repeated code patterns; functions that focus on collecting tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various applications; use of unverified external endpoints for data exfiltration; attempts to access encrypted data and decrypt using system APIs; dynamic environment and system path manipulations; suspicious external URLs; and use of threading to perform concurrent data collection and uploading.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive stealer malware designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, Discord, Telegram, wallets, and other applications. It decrypts data using Windows API functions, gathers tokens, cookies, passwords, billing info, and files, then exfiltrates via Discord webhook or uploads to file-sharing services. The code employs obfuscation tactics like variable name randomness, code repetition, and dynamic file handling. It also includes routines to bypass detection, such as killing processes (e.g., Chrome, Metamask) before archiving files. It actively searches for cryptocurrency wallets, gaming accounts, and other valuable data, indicating intent for financial theft. Its use of external services for data exfiltration, coupled with the presence of functions to decrypt system data, strongly indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious malware intended for information theft and exfiltration. It collects user tokens, passwords, cookies, billing details, and sensitive files from various applications and then sends or uploads this data to external servers, primarily through Discord webhooks and file sharing platforms. Its obfuscation, extensive data access, and remote communication confirm its malicious purpose.",
