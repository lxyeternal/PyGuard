  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, the presence of issues, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations Across Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe code with malicious intent: credential theft, data exfiltration, process killing, file manipulation, and obfuscation.\n- The code is highly obfuscated, uses external APIs, and exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads.\n- The malware score is consistently 1.0, which aligns with the described malicious activities.\n- The obfuscation scores vary but are generally high, reflecting the code's complexity.\n- The risk scores are all 1.0, which is justified given the malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes credential theft, data collection, and exfiltration.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Correctly notes dynamic dependency installation, deobfuscation, and covert data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately labels the code as highly malicious, with high confidence (0.9), malware (1.0), and risk (1.0).\n- **Scores:** All seem reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a comprehensive stealer, targeting tokens, cookies, passwords, and files.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Highlights obfuscation, external endpoints, process termination, and extensive data access.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately classifies as malware with high confidence (0.95), malware (1.0), and risk (1.0).\n- **Scores:** No issues. Valid.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the collection of browser data, tokens, cookies, and files.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Correctly notes decryption routines, obfuscation, and multiple exfiltration channels.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately labels as malicious with high confidence (0.95), malware (1.0), and risk (1.0).\n- **Scores:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the extraction of tokens, passwords, cookies, and system data.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Recognizes obfuscation, threading, decryption, and exfiltration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately high scores; code is malicious.\n- **Scores:** No adjustments needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a data stealer targeting tokens, cookies, files, etc.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Highlights obfuscation, external requests, process termination, and file handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid high scores; code is malicious.\n- **Scores:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Score Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score (1.0):** Fully justified for all reports, as all describe code with active data theft, exfiltration, process killing, and obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.9. Given the code's obfuscation tactics (variable names, regex patterns, dynamic imports), these seem reasonable.\n- **Risk Score (1.0):** Justified due to the malicious activities, high potential for harm, and active exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Adjustments & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The **obfuscated score** in some reports (e.g., 0.3 in report 5) might be slightly low given the described obfuscation tactics. I would recommend raising it to at least **0.6** for consistency.\n- The **malware score** is appropriate at 1.0 for all reports, considering the active malicious behaviors.\n- The **risk score** of 1.0 is justified and should remain.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 1.0 (all reports agree)\n- **Obfuscated:** I would assign **0.7–0.8** across all reports, reflecting the intentional obfuscation tactics.\n- **Risk:** 1.0 (highly malicious, active data theft)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note:**\n\nAll reports are consistent in their assessment of malicious activity. No report significantly overstates or understates the threat, and the scores align with the described behaviors.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 1.0     | 0.7          | 1.0   |\n| 2       | 1.0     | 0.8          | 1.0   |\n| 3       | 1.0     | 0.8          | 1.0   |\n| 4       | 1.0     | 0.8          | 1.0   |\n| 5       | 1.0     | 0.7          | 1.0   |\n\n**All are highly malicious, with appropriate severity scores.**",
