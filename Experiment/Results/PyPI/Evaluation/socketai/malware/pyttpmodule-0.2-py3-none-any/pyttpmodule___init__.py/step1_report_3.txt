  "purpose": "This script is designed to extract sensitive information from a user's system, including browser data, tokens, cookies, passwords, and files, and then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads, effectively functioning as a malicious information stealer and malware.",
  "sources": "Request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for IP, environment variables ('LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), reading browser data files (Login Data, Cookies, Local State), reading Discord-related directories, reading Steam and wallet files, reading Telegram data, reading various browser storage paths, and reading local files/directories for credentials, tokens, cookies, and files.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Discord API endpoints (user info, relationships, billing, badges, tokens), requests to webhooks for exfiltration, file uploads to external servers (Gofile, anonfiles), writing to local files (passw.txt, cook.txt), and executing system commands (taskkill).",
  "flows": "System data is gathered from multiple sources (browser storage, wallet files, chat logs, etc.), decrypted using Windows Data Protection API or AES, then sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and file upload services. Data such as tokens, cookies, passwords, files, and system info flow from local system storage to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple signs of malicious activity including the collection of tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from browsers and other applications; hardcoded webhook URL; repeated system commands to terminate processes; obfuscation of variable names; presence of functions for data exfiltration, zipping, and uploading files; extensive data scraping routines; malicious intent to steal personal and sensitive data; code structure indicates malicious intent rather than legitimate use.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numerous modules for network requests, system interaction, and cryptography, with some modules being conditionally installed. It collects system IP, user info, and geolocation data. It accesses browser data files (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and other applications (Steam, wallets, Telegram) to extract stored credentials, cookies, and tokens, decrypts encrypted data using Windows API and AES, and checks token validity via Discord API. The code then exfiltrates all this information through Discord webhooks, uploads files to third-party servers, and logs the data into local files. It also performs zip operations for file collection, gathering browser profiles, wallet data, and other sensitive files, then uploads these archives externally. There is extensive obfuscation of variable names and code structure, typical of malware. The code's primary purpose is to stealthily steal user data and send it to an attacker-controlled webhook, constituting malicious malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed explicitly for stealing personal, system, and application data, and exfiltrating it to remote servers. It employs encryption, decryption, obfuscation, and multiple exfiltration channels to conceal its purpose and maximize data theft. It should be classified as malware with a very high security risk score.",
