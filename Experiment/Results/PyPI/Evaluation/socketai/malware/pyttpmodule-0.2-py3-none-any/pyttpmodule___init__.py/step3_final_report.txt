{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive malware designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from browsers, applications, and system directories. It decrypts stored data, exfiltrates via webhooks and uploads, and employs obfuscation and process termination to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Local browser databases, environment variables, application data directories, system directories, and API endpoints for user info and geolocation.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Discord webhooks, file uploads to file-sharing services, writing logs and data files, terminating processes, and executing decryption routines.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local files and system APIs, decrypted if encrypted, then transmitted via webhooks or uploaded as zip files, often after obfuscation and process termination to cover tracks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic dependency installation, obfuscation techniques (variable renaming, regex patterns), process termination commands, decryption routines, and extensive threading for data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with credential and data theft malware. It decrypts stored credentials, collects tokens, cookies, passwords, and files, then exfiltrates this data via webhooks and uploads. Obfuscation tactics are employed to hinder analysis. The code also terminates processes to prevent detection. The overall activity is covert, active, and designed for maximum data theft and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious malware with high security risk. It actively steals sensitive data, employs obfuscation, and exfiltrates information covertly. The malware score is set to 1.0, the risk is maximal at 1.0, and the obfuscation level is high, warranting scores between 0.7 and 0.9. The only adjustment needed is increasing the obfuscation score of the last report from 0.3 to approximately 0.7 to better reflect its obfuscation tactics.",
