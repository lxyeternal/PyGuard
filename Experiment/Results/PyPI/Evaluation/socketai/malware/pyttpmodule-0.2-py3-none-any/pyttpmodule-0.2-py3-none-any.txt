      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious malware with high security risk. It actively steals sensitive data, employs obfuscation, and exfiltrates information covertly. The malware score is set to 1.0, the risk is maximal at 1.0, and the obfuscation level is high, warranting scores between 0.7 and 0.9. The only adjustment needed is increasing the obfuscation score of the last report from 0.3 to approximately 0.7 to better reflect its obfuscation tactics."
