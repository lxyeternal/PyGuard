  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low suspicion; Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential hidden activity but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments to Report 2's malware score to 0.5 and risk to 0.6 are recommended to better align with suspicion levels. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, but vigilance is advised for obfuscated code."
