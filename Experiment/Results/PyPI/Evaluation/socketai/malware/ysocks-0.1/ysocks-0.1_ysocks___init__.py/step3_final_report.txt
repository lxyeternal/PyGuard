  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution, data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file system modifications, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From data sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network connections or file writes, possibly via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, complex dynamic features, inconsistent scoring (notably in Report 3), potential hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns in code structure.",
  "analysis": "Report 3's inconsistency between obfuscation (0.4) and malware (0) scores was identified; both should be zero given no suspicious activity. Report 2's high obfuscation (0.7) and suspicion justify a malware score around 0.4-0.5; a slight increase to 0.5 is recommended for cautiousness. Other reports are consistent with benign code, with low malware and risk scores. Overall, the suspicion is low to moderate, with Report 2 being the most concerning but not definitively malicious. Scores are adjusted to reflect these insights, maintaining a conservative stance.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low suspicion; Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential hidden activity but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are mostly appropriate; minor adjustments to Report 2's malware score to 0.5 and risk to 0.6 are recommended to better align with suspicion levels. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, but vigilance is advised for obfuscated code.",
