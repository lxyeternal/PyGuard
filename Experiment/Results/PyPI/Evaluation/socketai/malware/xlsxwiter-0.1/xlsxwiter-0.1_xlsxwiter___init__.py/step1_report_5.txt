{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, external files, or environment variables. Specific sources are not explicitly identified due to lack of context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but no clear source-to-sink paths are evident without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically standard, with typical function definitions and operations. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communications, system modifications, or secret data handling, are detected. The absence of context limits full analysis, but based on available code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application code without suspicious patterns.",
