      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, heavily obfuscated, and performs system modifications, package installations, and privilege checks that could compromise system security. The obfuscation and system interactions strongly suggest malicious intent, making it unsafe to execute. It should be flagged as malware and removed from supply chain distributions."

The scoring is consistent with the summaries, and no adjustments are necessary unless further code evidence suggests otherwise."
