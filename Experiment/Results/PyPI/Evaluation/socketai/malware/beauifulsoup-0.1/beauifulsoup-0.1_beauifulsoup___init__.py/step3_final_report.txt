{
  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on dynamic code execution, data leaks, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "eval()/exec() calls, hardcoded URLs/IPs, environment variables, data flows from untrusted sources",
  "sinks": "Network communication (exfiltration), file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() and untrusted data inputs flow into dynamic execution or network transmission sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, hardcoded exfiltration endpoints, suspicious data flows",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some patterns indicating potential data exfiltration. Benign code shows no suspicious activity. Suspicious patterns include eval/exec usage and obfuscated variables, leading to moderate malware and security risk scores. Benign code lacks these indicators. The overall suspicion is moderate, with scores reflecting the presence of red flags but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. Scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, warranting cautious review but not outright rejection.",
