{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines the installation process for a Python package named 'google-requests', including a custom installation step that executes an external script 'pre_install'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from the 'pre_install' module imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'pre_install()' during installation; potential sinks could include whatever actions are performed within 'pre_install'.",
  "flows": "The installation process flows from executing the custom 'run' method which calls 'pre_install()', then proceeds with the standard installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a custom install command executing 'pre_install' can be normal, but without inspecting 'pre_install', it could be suspicious. The URL 'http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable' is non-standard, potentially malicious or placeholder. No other anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules for package setup and defines a custom install class that runs an external script 'pre_install' before proceeding with the normal installation. The setup configuration appears typical, with package details, dependencies, and classifiers. The key concern is the execution of 'pre_install' during installation, which could execute arbitrary code if 'pre_install' is malicious or compromised. The URL provided is non-functional and potentially suspicious. Without inspecting 'pre_install.py', we cannot confirm the nature of its actions, but executing arbitrary scripts during install is a potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a typical setup script with a custom install step that executes an external script. The main concern is the execution of 'pre_install()', which could contain malicious code, especially given the non-standard URL and lack of visibility into 'pre_install'. Overall, this setup script has a moderate risk level due to the external script execution, but no definitive malicious code is present within this fragment.",
