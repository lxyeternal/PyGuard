{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, incorporating a custom installation step that runs a pre-install script.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and the custom pre_install module; invocation of pre_install() within the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "The run() method calls pre_install() before proceeding with the standard installation process. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "The pre_install() script is invoked during installation without details of its content, which could be suspicious if malicious code exists within that script. The download_url points to a non-standard, possibly fake URL. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script customizes the package installation by executing pre_install(), which could be used maliciously if pre_install.py contains harmful code. The rest of the setup script is standard and appears benign. The URL and download URL are suspicious due to non-standard or non-reliable links, which could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. No other anomalies such as obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident in this script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious code; however, the execution of pre_install() and suspicious URLs warrant caution. The true risk depends on the content of pre_install.py, which is not provided. The package setup could be used to run malicious code if pre_install.py is malicious. Overall, low confidence in the full security assessment without inspecting pre_install.py.",
