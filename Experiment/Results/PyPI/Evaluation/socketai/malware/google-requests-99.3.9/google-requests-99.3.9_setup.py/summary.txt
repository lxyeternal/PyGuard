  "conclusion": "The setup script executes an external, unknown script during installation, posing a potential security risk. The suspicious URL and lack of visibility into pre_install() warrant caution. The current scores reflect moderate concern but are appropriate given the information. Further inspection of pre_install() is recommended before trusting this package."
