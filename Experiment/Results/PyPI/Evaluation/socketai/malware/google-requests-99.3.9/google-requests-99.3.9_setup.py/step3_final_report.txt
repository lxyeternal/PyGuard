  "purpose": "The setup script defines a Python package with a custom installation process that executes an external pre_install() script before proceeding with installation.",
  "sources": "The import of pre_install module and its invocation within the CustomInstall.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of pre_install() during setup, which could run malicious code if pre_install contains harmful instructions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method calls pre_install(), then proceeds with super().run(), executing any code within pre_install.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable' is suspicious and likely a placeholder or malicious domain; the pre_install module's content is unknown, representing an external code execution risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom install class executing pre_install() prior to installation. The primary concern is executing external code during setup, which could be malicious if pre_install contains harmful instructions. The URL provided is suspicious, indicating possible placeholder or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.3, risk around 0.4) are reasonable given the uncertainty. Since no evidence of malicious code is present in the snippet, the obfuscated score remains 0. The main risk stems from executing an external script of unknown content, which warrants caution. The scores could be slightly increased if suspicion about pre_install's maliciousness is high, but without evidence, the current scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes an external, unknown script during installation, posing a potential security risk. The suspicious URL and lack of visibility into pre_install() warrant caution. The current scores reflect moderate concern but are appropriate given the information. Further inspection of pre_install() is recommended before trusting this package.",
