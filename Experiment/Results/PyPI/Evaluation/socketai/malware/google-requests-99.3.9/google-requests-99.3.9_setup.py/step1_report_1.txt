{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'google-requests', with a custom install command that runs a pre-install script before installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, the 'pre_install' module, and the setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup script itself does not directly write or execute untrusted code, but the invocation of 'pre_install()' is a potential sink if 'pre_install' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The flow is: import modules -> define CustomInstall class -> run 'pre_install()' in the custom run() method -> proceed with standard installation. The main concern is the execution of 'pre_install()'.",
  "anomalies": "The 'pre_install' module's content is not provided; executing an imported script during setup can be risky if the module is malicious or tampered with. The 'download_url' points to an unrelated, non-standard URL ('http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable'), which is suspicious or placeholder. The rest of the script appears standard for a setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly sets up package installation with a custom command that executes 'pre_install()' before installation. Since the content of 'pre_install' is unknown, the execution of this script poses potential security risk if 'pre_install' contains malicious code, such as backdoors or system modifications. The setup configuration parameters are typical, but the presence of a placeholder URL and a custom pre-install step warrants caution. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is evident directly in this script, but the execution of external code via 'pre_install()' is a concern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself appears standard but includes a call to an external 'pre_install()' script, which could be malicious if tampered with. The lack of details about 'pre_install' prevents a definitive security assessment. Overall, the script's main risk depends on the content of 'pre_install'.",
