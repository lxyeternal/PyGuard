  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; further analysis of the code content is required to determine its intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user inputs via function parameters, and possibly external files or network resources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (sending or receiving data), file writes, executing system commands, or logging sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network transmission, file storage, or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected; however, thorough review of imported modules and dynamic code execution points is needed to confirm.",
  "analysis": "The code structure and content are not provided, so the analysis is based on typical patterns. Without specific code, we consider the possibility of hidden or malicious logic, especially in parts where dynamic execution, obscure variable naming, or network communication could occur. Any hardcoded secrets, unusual imports, or conditional logic triggering unexpected actions would be flagged. Currently, no such anomalies are explicitly visible. To finalize, review of actual code content is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of explicit malicious code snippets and obfuscation in the provided data, the code appears benign. However, due to the lack of specific code details, there remains some uncertainty. No definitive malicious behavior or security risks are identified at this stage.",
