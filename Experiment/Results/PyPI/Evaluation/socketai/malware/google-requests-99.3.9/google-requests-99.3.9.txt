      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious-like behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external endpoint using insecure shell execution. While it lacks embedded malware payloads, its pattern of data collection and transmission is characteristic of malicious activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious."

      "conclusion": "The setup script executes an external, unknown script during installation, posing a potential security risk. The suspicious URL and lack of visibility into pre_install() warrant caution. The current scores reflect moderate concern but are appropriate given the information. Further inspection of pre_install() is recommended before trusting this package."

      "conclusion": "Based on the available descriptions, the code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. Should actual code become available, a detailed static and dynamic review would be recommended to confirm these findings."
