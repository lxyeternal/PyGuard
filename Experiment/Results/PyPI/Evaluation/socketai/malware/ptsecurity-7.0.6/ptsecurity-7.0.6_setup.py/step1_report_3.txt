{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'ptsecurity' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION', package data from 'src' directory",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data output or network connections directly executed",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "Presence of imports like requests, json, socket which are not used anywhere in the code; no actual use or malicious activity detected from this",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and configuration. It imports modules such as requests, json, and socket but does not utilize them within the script, which is suspicious but not malicious by itself. No code reads user input or untrusted data at runtime, and no network activity or secret handling is evident. The environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' allows dynamic versioning, which is typical. The inclusion of unused imports might be an attempt to obfuscate or prepare for malicious extension, but as-is, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with no direct malicious behavior. The unused imports could suggest preparation for future code or obfuscation, but in this form, it appears safe. No malware or security risks are detected.",
