{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'ptsecurity', primarily used for package distribution and dependency management.",
  "sources": "The script reads environment variables (PACKAGE_VERSION), and imports modules (setuptools, requests, json, os, socket).",
  "sinks": "The script does not appear to use untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or harmful actions; no sinks are invoked with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_VERSION' influences package versioning; no flow from external input to potentially dangerous operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary import of 'requests', 'json', and 'socket' modules that are not used anywhere in the setup process; this could be benign but is unusual. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging. It reads the package version from an environment variable, defaulting to '7.0.6'. It includes a find_packages call limited to the 'src' directory and 'ptsecurity*' packages. The imported modules 'requests', 'json', and 'socket' are unused, which is unusual but not malicious. No data is read from untrusted sources in a harmful way; no code injection or suspicious behavior is detected. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications beyond standard packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward setup file with some unused imports, possibly boilerplate or placeholders. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The package setup is typical and does not exhibit malicious patterns.",
