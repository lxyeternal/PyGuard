  "purpose": "A simple Python print statement outputting 'Hello world'.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data reading functions; static code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no external dependencies, inputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security threat and is entirely benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated, with zero security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
