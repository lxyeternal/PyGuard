{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup configuration for a Python package named 'selfcvpy', including package metadata and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (checking if 'tahg' exists), environment variables (implicitly through subprocess), and possibly network activity via subprocess invocation.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen command executes an encoded PowerShell command, which could potentially be malicious if the encoded payload is harmful. The setup function itself does not perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess, then proceeds to call setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command is suspicious; it is embedded as a base64 string, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The code attempts to run this command without any validation or logs, and it is wrapped in a try-except that silently ignores errors. The use of such encoded commands in a setup script is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing 'distutils.core.setup'. It then tries to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. If the file 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window style, without any validation or error handling. The comment in the PowerShell command references a suspicious URL. After that, it attempts to call 'setup()' with package details. The silent exception handling around both blocks suggests an attempt to conceal failure or malicious activity. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell code indicates malicious intent or sabotage, especially considering the embedded URL and obfuscated command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell code executed during package setup, likely attempting to perform malicious actions or communicate with a malicious server. The silent error handling and obfuscated payload strongly indicate malicious intent or sabotage embedded within the package setup process.",
