      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious intent due to execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands during setup, combined with error suppression. This pattern is characteristic of malicious payload delivery or backdoor installation. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated with caution until further decoding and analysis of the payload."
