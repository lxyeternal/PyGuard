  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the use of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands that, in at least one case, download and execute malware. The silent error handling and conditional execution further support malicious intent. Scores should reflect high malware likelihood, obfuscation, and security risk, especially considering the decoded payloads in reports that reveal malicious downloads."
