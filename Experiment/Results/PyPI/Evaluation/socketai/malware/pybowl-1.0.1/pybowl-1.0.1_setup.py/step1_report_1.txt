{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pybowl' with custom installation behavior, primarily using setuptools for packaging. The custom install class executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded and executed within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method, which is invoked during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code; potential for malicious actions if the decoded payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, then during installation, it executes the decoded base64 payload, which can lead to arbitrary code execution at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() in the install process; obfuscated payload that may conceal malicious behavior; the payload appears to perform network requests and run scripts based on decoded instructions.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and includes a custom install command that, during installation, imports 'base64' and executes a decoded payload using exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated, which is suspicious, as it involves creating an object, running system commands, and making HTTP requests. The payload seems to perform network activity, possibly to a malicious domain, and runs arbitrary commands. The code uses 'exec()' with decoded data, which is a known security risk and often used to hide malicious code. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign, but the key concern is the obfuscated payload executed at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious code that executes during installation via exec() of a base64-decoded payload. This payload appears designed to perform network requests and run system commands, indicating malicious intent. The package could compromise systems where installed, and the obfuscation is a significant red flag.",
