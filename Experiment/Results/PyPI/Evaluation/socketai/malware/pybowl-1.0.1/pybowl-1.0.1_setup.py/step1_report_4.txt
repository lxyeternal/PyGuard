{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pybowl' with custom installation behavior that executes embedded code upon installation.",
  "sources": "The embedded base64-encoded string executed during the custom install command, which is decoded and run as Python code.",
  "sinks": "The decoded and executed code can perform actions such as creating objects, calling functions, or potentially executing malicious operations if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes, decoding and executing the embedded base64 string, which then can perform arbitrary actions.",
  "anomalies": "The use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution of code during installation is unusual and suspicious. The code within the base64 string appears to perform network operations, create objects, and run functions that may be malicious. Presence of heavily obfuscated code and dynamic exec is a strong anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that, when run, imports the 'base64' module and then executes a hardcoded base64-encoded string using 'exec'. The decoded string contains obfuscated Python code that appears to perform network requests, create objects, and run commands, potentially acting as a backdoor or malicious payload. This code runs during package installation, which can be exploited to run arbitrary code on user systems. The overall structure and heavy obfuscation, combined with the dynamic execution, indicate malicious intent. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the embedded payload is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a malicious backdoor that executes obfuscated code during installation, which can perform unauthorized actions on the system. The use of base64 decoding and 'exec' during setup strongly suggests malicious intent. The code should not be used or installed.",
