{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'pybowl', primarily for packaging and installation. The code also executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64-encoded string decoded and executed in the CustomInstallCommand.run() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code, which can perform arbitrary actions; no explicit network or file operations visible outside the obfuscated payload.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method decodes and executes obfuscated code, which is the main source-to-sink flow. No other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically. The decoded code appears to import modules, create objects, and run code without clear transparency. The presence of obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package setup, which is standard. However, the CustomInstallCommand.run() method imports base64, then decodes and executes a large, obfuscated base64 string. The decoded code imports modules, creates objects, and executes code, indicating potentially malicious activity. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are suspicious, as they prevent easy inspection. The payload appears to perform network requests, possibly sending data or communicating with external servers, based on the decoded content. The rest of the code, including setup parameters, is typical. The obfuscated code's purpose is likely malicious, possibly a backdoor or data exfiltration tool, hidden behind standard setup logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payload during installation, indicating malicious intent. The overall setup appears legitimate but is compromised by the hidden, malicious payload executed during install. This package should be considered suspicious and potentially harmful.",
