{
  "purpose": "The code executes a heavily obfuscated base64-encoded payload during installation, which is decoded and run via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string within CustomInstallCommand.run(), which is decoded and executed at install time.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decoded payload, which can perform network requests, system commands, or exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "The payload is decoded from base64 during the run() method of CustomInstallCommand and then executed via exec(), leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() during setup, heavily obfuscated payload, and potential network/system activity embedded within the decoded code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a custom install command that decodes a base64 string, and executes it with exec(). The payload is heavily obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The payload likely performs network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration. The setup function registers this custom command, causing the payload to run during installation. The obfuscation and code execution pattern are classic indicators of malicious intent. Given the high suspicion, the payload's behavior, and red flags, the malware score is set to 1, obfuscation score to 1, and security risk score to 1. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the pattern is a well-known malicious tactic.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a heavily obfuscated payload executed during installation, strongly indicating malicious activity. It poses a severe security risk and should be flagged or avoided. The high obfuscation and dynamic code execution are red flags for supply chain attacks or backdoors.",
