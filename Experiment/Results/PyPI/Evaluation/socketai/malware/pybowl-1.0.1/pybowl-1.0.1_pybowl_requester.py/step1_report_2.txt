  "purpose": "The code defines an empty class named 'send', likely intended for future extension or as a placeholder.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The class is completely empty with no methods or attributes, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single class definition with no implementation details, inputs, outputs, or external interactions. It does not perform any actions, data processing, or communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The minimal code may serve as a placeholder, but on its own, it does not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder class with no malicious intent or security issues. It lacks functionality and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
