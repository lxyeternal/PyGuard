  "purpose": "Defines an empty class named 'send'.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class is defined but contains no methods or attributes; the code is extremely minimal and does not perform any actions. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single class definition with no attributes or methods, serving no functional purpose beyond defining an empty class. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no outputs. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. Its simplicity suggests it is likely a placeholder or incomplete fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions or contain any suspicious elements. Overall, it is benign but very minimal.",
