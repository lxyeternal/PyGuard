  "purpose": "A trivial Python class named 'send' with no attributes or methods, serving as a placeholder or stub.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the class is empty and non-functional.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty class 'send' with no attributes, methods, or logic. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, placeholder class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned—malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0—are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its harmlessness. The code does not contain any obfuscation or malicious code, and there are no data flows or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial class with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
