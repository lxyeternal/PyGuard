      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup, likely intended for remote code execution or payload delivery. The suspicious indicators and obfuscation justify a high malware score (~0.8), high obfuscation score (~0.9), and high security risk (~0.85). The package should be flagged for further investigation and caution in distribution."
