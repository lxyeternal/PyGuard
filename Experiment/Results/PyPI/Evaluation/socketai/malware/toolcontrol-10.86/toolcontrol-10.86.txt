      "conclusion": "The code contains a high suspicion of malicious activity due to the covert, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally. The setup code appears legitimate, but the embedded command's behavior warrants caution. The high obfuscation and silent execution justify high malware and risk scores. Further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm its exact payload, but current evidence suggests malicious or backdoor functionality."
