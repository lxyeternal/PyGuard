  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, especially under conditional filesystem checks and silent error handling. The high obfuscation and execution context justify elevated malware and risk scores. It should be treated as potentially malicious until payload analysis confirms otherwise."
