{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic operations such as printing a message and defining functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks like network connections, file writes, or system modifications that could be exploited with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable; the code executes straightforwardly without data manipulation or transfer from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple print statements and function definitions without external inputs or outputs. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious payloads, or security-compromising behavior. No suspicious imports or runtime behaviors are present. The absence of network activity, data handling, or environment variable usage further reduces concern. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for basic scripting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a harmless script without any supply chain threats or malware indicators.",
