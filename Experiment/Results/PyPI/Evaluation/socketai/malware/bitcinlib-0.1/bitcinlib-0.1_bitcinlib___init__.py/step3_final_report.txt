  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency security reports for malicious behavior, anomalies, and risks, ensuring scores align with findings.",
  "sources": "No code provided in reports 1, 3, and 2; code snippets or descriptions in reports 4 and 5, including environment variables, input functions, eval/exec usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential eval/exec calls with untrusted input, environment variable reads, network operations, file access, print statements, and data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into eval/exec or data processing functions; in report 5, untrusted input flows into eval/exec, representing a high-risk source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Report 5 describes use of eval/exec with untrusted input, indicating risky dynamic code execution; other reports show no anomalies, missing code, or benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 3 lack code, correctly scored with zero malware and risk. Reports 2 and 4 contain no suspicious patterns, aligning with low scores and high confidence. Report 5 features eval/exec with untrusted input, a known security concern; scores reflect moderate suspicion (malware 0.5, risk 0.75). Adjustments suggest increasing malware score in report 5 to 0.6 for higher caution. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with benign reports appropriately scored low, and report 5's risky pattern acknowledged.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or lack code, warranting low scores. Report 5's use of eval/exec on untrusted input justifies higher suspicion; scores are adjusted accordingly. Final assessments: malware ~0.45, obfuscated 0, security risk ~0.3, aligning with the evidence and reasoning.",
