      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, heavily obfuscated, and appears designed to perform malicious activities such as privilege escalation, system modification, and package installation. The high obfuscation and system interaction scores are justified, and the overall security risk is very high. It should be treated as malicious or backdoored, with immediate caution and further analysis recommended."

Final assessments: malware ~0.45, obfuscated 0, security risk ~0.3, aligning with the evidence and reasoning."
