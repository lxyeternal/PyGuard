  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during package setup, with characteristics typical of malicious activity. The subprocess call and URL comment support the suspicion of malicious intent. The high scores are justified, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
