  "conclusion": "The pattern of creating and executing a script in the temp directory during installation is suspicious and potentially dangerous. While the current code appears benign, this technique is often used in supply chain attacks. The malware score should be increased to around 0.4, and the risk score to approximately 0.65, reflecting the potential for malicious exploitation. Further vetting of 'dshttpslib' is recommended before distribution or use."
