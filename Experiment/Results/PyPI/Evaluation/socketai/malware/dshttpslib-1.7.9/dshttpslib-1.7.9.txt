      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The pattern of creating and executing a script in the temp directory during installation is suspicious and potentially dangerous. While the current code appears benign, this technique is often used in supply chain attacks. The malware score should be increased to around 0.4, and the risk score to approximately 0.65, reflecting the potential for malicious exploitation. Further vetting of 'dshttpslib' is recommended before distribution or use."

      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, exhibiting all characteristics of a remote access trojan and info stealer, with extensive capabilities for data exfiltration, persistence, and remote command execution. The scores assigned—malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0.5—are justified based on its behavior and code clarity. The threat level is high, and the code should be considered highly dangerous."
