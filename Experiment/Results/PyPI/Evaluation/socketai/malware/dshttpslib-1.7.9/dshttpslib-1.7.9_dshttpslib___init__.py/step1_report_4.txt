{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed to extract sensitive information such as browser data, tokens, cookies, passwords, credit card details, and system information from an infected system, then exfiltrate it to a remote server. It also includes functionalities for screenshot capture, webcam activation, file theft, and keylogging, indicating intent to monitor and compromise user privacy and security.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from browser profile directories, local state files, LevelDB databases, SQLite databases (e.g., Web Data, Login Data, History, Cookies), environment variables, system commands, and user directories such as Downloads, Desktop, Documents, and OneDrive.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network connections using socketio emit functions, POST requests to remote endpoints, and file uploads via HTTP requests. Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, credit card info, and system information is exfiltrated to the attacker's server.",
  "flows": "The code collects tokens, passwords, cookies, browsing history, credit card details, and system info (sources), then transmits this data via network requests to the server specified by api_url (sinks). Keylogging and screenshot capture are triggered by server commands, with key logs sent directly over socketio. Files are collected and uploaded based on configured directories.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded URL for command and control server, obfuscated or misleading variable/function names, use of techniques to evade detection (e.g., copying itself to startup folder, creating zip archives of sensitive data), attempts to hide console window, inclusion of potentially malicious functionalities (keylogger, webcam, screen capture), and data exfiltration without user consent. The code also contains dev comments and code structure typical of malware.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious trojan designed to silently run on a victim's system. It establishes persistence by copying itself to the startup folder. It can extract browser passwords, cookies, credit card info, tokens, and browsing history from various browsers. It captures screenshots and webcam images, logs keystrokes, and uploads or transmits all gathered data to a remote server. It leverages several third-party libraries for encryption, web automation, and system interaction, which are used maliciously to access protected data. The use of socketio enables real-time command and control from the attacker. The code also supports downloading files, executing commands, and sending alerts, indicating a comprehensive backdoor toolkit.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive information-stealing malware. It exfiltrates user credentials, tokens, browser data, system information, and multimedia, while maintaining persistence and offering remote control capabilities. The presence of hardcoded server URLs, stealth techniques, and malicious functionalities confirm a high likelihood of malicious intent. This package should be considered extremely dangerous and should not be used.",
