  "is_malicious": true,
  "malware_score": 1,
  "security_risk": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0.5,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, exhibiting all characteristics of a remote access trojan and info stealer, with extensive capabilities for data exfiltration, persistence, and remote command execution. The scores assigned—malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0.5—are justified based on its behavior and code clarity. The threat level is high, and the code should be considered highly dangerous."
