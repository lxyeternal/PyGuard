{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'etherem' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes encrypted code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hardcoded version, description, long description, and encrypted key and ciphertext within the run method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(Fernet(...).decrypt(...)) on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts an embedded encrypted payload and executes it via exec, which could run malicious code if the payload is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and execution of decrypted code during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The use of Fernet for decryption and immediate execution is concerning; the code appears to hide malicious intent behind encryption.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup for a Python package with minimal functionality but includes a custom install command class that, when run on Windows, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload embedded as encrypted data. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, and executing decrypted code during installation poses a high security risk. The use of Fernet encryption and the execution of dynamically decrypted code are common tactics to obfuscate malicious actions. The package’s overall setup and metadata appear normal, but the embedded encrypted code indicates malicious or at least suspicious behavior, especially since the payload is executed directly during install without further validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the embedded decryption and execution pose significant security concerns.",
