{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'etherem', involving custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for version, description, and long description. It also reads environment variables implicitly via os.name and potentially from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload if on Windows, which could execute arbitrary code with system privileges.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string and executes it via exec(), creating a source-to-sink path for malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed dynamically; no clear reason for decrypting and executing code during package setup; long, obfuscated description strings; unusual class name and method structure; setup_requires including 'fernet' and 'requests' which are used only in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a package 'etherem'. It includes a custom install command class that, on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and token, and executes the decrypted code dynamically via exec(). The long description strings are nonsensical and appear obfuscated. The decryption and exec() pattern is suspicious, indicating potential malicious payload execution during installation. The use of encrypted payloads suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup tasks beyond this malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows, which could be used to run malware or backdoors. The rest of the setup code appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious payload execution. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
