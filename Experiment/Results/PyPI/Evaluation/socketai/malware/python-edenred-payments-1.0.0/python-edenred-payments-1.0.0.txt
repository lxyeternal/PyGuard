      "conclusion": "The code performs silent data exfiltration during installation to a suspicious URL, constituting malicious-like privacy invasion. The existing reports correctly identify this behavior, and their high malware and risk scores are justified. However, considering the code's simplicity and lack of payloads, a malware score around 0.6-0.75 and risk score around 0.8 are appropriate. The behavior warrants caution, and the package should be flagged for privacy violations."
