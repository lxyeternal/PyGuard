{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during installation and sends it to a suspicious external URL via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "source functions -> data stored in 'ploads' -> requests.get() sending data to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Silent data exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; no obfuscation; straightforward code; external URL is suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, gathers system info and transmits it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. The data collection uses standard system calls, and the network request occurs unconditionally during install, which is unusual and privacy-invasive. The URL appears malicious or at least untrusted. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, raising privacy concerns. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0.75-0.9, risk 0.8-0.9) are justified given the silent, unnotified transmission of system info. However, technically, this is not malware but malicious-like privacy invasion. The code's straightforward nature and lack of destructive actions suggest the malware score could be slightly lower, but the high risk and privacy breach justify high scores. The behavior warrants caution and indicates potential malicious intent, especially if used for tracking or surveillance purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs silent data exfiltration during installation to a suspicious URL, constituting malicious-like privacy invasion. The existing reports correctly identify this behavior, and their high malware and risk scores are justified. However, considering the code's simplicity and lack of payloads, a malware score around 0.6-0.75 and risk score around 0.8 are appropriate. The behavior warrants caution, and the package should be flagged for privacy violations.",
