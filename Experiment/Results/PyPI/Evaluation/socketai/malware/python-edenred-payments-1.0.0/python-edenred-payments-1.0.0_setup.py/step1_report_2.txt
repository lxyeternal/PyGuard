{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The data is gathered from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() calls during installation.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL using requests.get().",
  "flows": "During the custom install run, system info (hostname, current directory, username) flows from source calls into the 'ploads' dictionary, then flows into the URL request to the external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any visible validation or user consent before sending data. The URL is suspicious and untrusted. The code leaks system information during installation without transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to send system-specific details to an external server during package installation. The data collection uses standard system calls (hostname, cwd, username) and then transmits this data via an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious or untrusted domain. There are no security checks, encryption, or user prompts. This behavior resembles a privacy violation or potential data exfiltration. No other malicious activities, such as code injection or backdoors, are present in the code, but the data collection and transmission are suspicious and unauthorized in most contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, sending system information to a suspicious external server. It constitutes a privacy violation and should be considered malicious or suspicious.",
