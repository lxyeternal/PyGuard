  "purpose": "Define a setup script for a Python package that performs a custom installation step to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Imports (requests, socket, getpass, os); socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with a remote URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, username → sent via HTTP GET request to a remote server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional sending of system information during installation without user consent; no indication of explicit user notification; use of suspicious URL domain",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately upon running, it makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL, transmitting this information. This behavior occurs without any user interaction or explicit warning, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The remote URL appears suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration. The code uses standard library functions and third-party 'requests' library appropriately, but the intent to send system info silently during install is concerning. No obfuscation or malware-like code is present, but the behavior is privacy-intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a potentially malicious action by silently transmitting system information to a suspicious domain during package installation, indicating privacy invasion or data collection without user consent. The code is straightforward but exhibits malicious behavior due to the unexpected data exfiltration.",
