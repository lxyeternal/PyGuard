  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that customizes installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to an external URL with hostname, current working directory, and username as parameters during installation.",
  "sinks": "External HTTP GET request that transmits system information, which could be used for tracking or data collection.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of transmitting system info to an external domain during package installation; domain appears suspicious; no apparent legitimate reason for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. This behavior is not standard for typical setup scripts and indicates potential data collection or tracking. The domain used is not recognized as a reputable service and appears suspicious. There are no other malicious functions, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The primary concern is the unintended or malicious data exfiltration during package installation, which could be used for malicious surveillance or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information to a suspicious domain during package installation. This behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking, classifying this as malicious activity. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
