{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration that executes a custom installation step during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() respectively.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL 'https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun'.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are collected and then transmitted to the external server via requests.get call during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes an outbound HTTP request during installation without user consent or explicit purpose, which is unusual and suspicious. No input validation or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define a package. A custom install command is created that, upon running, collects hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical post-install tasks, it sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially as it occurs silently during package installation. The external URL does not belong to a known domain, raising suspicion. The code does not use any obfuscation or complex code techniques, but the hidden data transmission during installation is a significant red flag.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly transmitting system information to an external server during package installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. This behavior warrants suspicion and suggests the package is potentially malicious.",
