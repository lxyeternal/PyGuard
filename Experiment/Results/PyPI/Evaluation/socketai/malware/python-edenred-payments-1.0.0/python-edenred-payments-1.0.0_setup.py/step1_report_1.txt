{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, which includes a custom installation step that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The data is collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() calls during the custom install run method.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external domain, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "System information gathered from hostname, current working directory, and username flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits it over the network to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network request during installation without user consent, sending hostname, current directory, and username, which could be used for tracking or fingerprinting.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup with a custom install command. The CustomInstall class overrides the run method to execute the standard installation process, then gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after, it sends this data to a suspicious external URL via an HTTP GET request. No other malicious behaviors such as file modification, data exfiltration beyond the request, or hidden backdoors are evident. The network call occurs during installation, which could be considered privacy-invasive or malicious if used without disclosure. However, there is no evidence of code injection, credential theft, or damaging actions.\n\nGiven that the external URL is unusual and the data transmission occurs automatically during install without explicit user approval, this behavior is suspicious. It appears designed for tracking or fingerprinting purposes rather than legitimate setup activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior where system information is silently sent to an external domain during package installation, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance without user consent. No other malicious actions are detected, but this activity warrants suspicion due to privacy concerns.",
