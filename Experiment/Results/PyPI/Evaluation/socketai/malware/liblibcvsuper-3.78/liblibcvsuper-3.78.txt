      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, with external contact and error suppression. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote control or data exfiltration. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by malicious-looking preamble. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Until then, treat this package as malicious."
