  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data flows, input sources, and potential sinks within the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Locations where untrusted data could influence system behavior, such as network calls, eval/exec, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communications).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious network activity, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly benign or placeholders, with minimal or no suspicious patterns. Report 1 correctly identifies an empty code base, assigning a high confidence but should set security risk to 0 instead of 0.9. Report 2 notes ambiguous code with potential obfuscation and dynamic execution; the suspicion is valid but the malware score can be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 to reflect the lack of confirmed malicious payloads. Reports 3, 4, and 5 describe straightforward, benign code with low security risks and no obfuscation or malware indicators, consistent with their scores. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the code content, with minor score adjustments recommended for Report 1 and possibly Report 2 to better match the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show minimal to no malicious intent, with only slight suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution hints. The scores are generally appropriate, with a minor correction to Report 1's security risk score. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the provided snippets.",
