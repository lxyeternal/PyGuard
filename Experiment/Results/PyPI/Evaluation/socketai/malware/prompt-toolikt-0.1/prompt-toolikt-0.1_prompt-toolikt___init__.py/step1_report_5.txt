  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to data processing or possibly package setup, based on typical structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules, and possibly reads files or data streams depending on the full content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code if present, though not explicitly seen in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data likely flows from environment variables or input functions to processing or output functions; however, specific flow details are not visible in the provided fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears standard, with no suspicious function calls or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard imports and setup routines typical of Python projects. No malicious or suspicious code structures are detected. The absence of visible network activity, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration points suggests low risk. Without further content, no anomalies or malicious intent are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard Python setup or data processing script with no suspicious elements.",
