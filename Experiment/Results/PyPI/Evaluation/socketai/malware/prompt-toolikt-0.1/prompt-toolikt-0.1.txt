      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its heavy obfuscation, system-level operations, privilege checks, and covert control flow suggest intent to compromise the host system, escalate privileges, or install malicious packages. The high scores for malware (around 0.85), obfuscation (around 0.9), and overall security risk (around 0.9) are justified. It should be flagged, analyzed further in a sandbox, and removed from any environment until verified safe."

      "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show minimal to no malicious intent, with only slight suspicion in Report 2 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution hints. The scores are generally appropriate, with a minor correction to Report 1's security risk score. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the provided snippets."
