  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and executes a hidden PowerShell command conditionally, which strongly suggests malicious or suspicious behavior. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics such as obfuscation, concealed execution, and error suppression. While the actual payload remains undecoded, the overall behavior warrants caution and further analysis before trusting or deploying this package."
