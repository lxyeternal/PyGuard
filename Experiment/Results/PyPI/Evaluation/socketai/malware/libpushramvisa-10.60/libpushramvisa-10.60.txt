      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity, primarily through the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command referencing a suspicious URL. The package setup code is standard but is likely exploited as a vector for malicious payloads. The silent error suppression and obfuscation increase the risk profile substantially. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be treated as compromised or malicious."
