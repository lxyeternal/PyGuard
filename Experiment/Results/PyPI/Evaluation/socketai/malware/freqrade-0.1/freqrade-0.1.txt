      "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated with complex calculations and dynamic string assembly, designed to conceal its true purpose. It performs system modifications, package installations, and file operations that could be malicious, such as creating shortcuts, installing packages, or manipulating system files. The presence of privilege checks and system calls further indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious behavior potential."

      "conclusion": "The code shows no confirmed malicious behavior but contains suspicious constructs that warrant cautious scoring. The malware score remains low (0.2), and the risk score is slightly elevated (0.3) due to potential for misuse. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the dependency appears benign but with minor concerns that should be monitored."
