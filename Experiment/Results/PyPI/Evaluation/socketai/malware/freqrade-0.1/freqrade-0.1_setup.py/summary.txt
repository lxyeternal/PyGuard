  "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated with complex calculations and dynamic string assembly, designed to conceal its true purpose. It performs system modifications, package installations, and file operations that could be malicious, such as creating shortcuts, installing packages, or manipulating system files. The presence of privilege checks and system calls further indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious behavior potential."
