  "conclusion": "The code shows no confirmed malicious behavior but contains suspicious constructs that warrant cautious scoring. The malware score remains low (0.2), and the risk score is slightly elevated (0.3) due to potential for misuse. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the dependency appears benign but with minor concerns that should be monitored."
