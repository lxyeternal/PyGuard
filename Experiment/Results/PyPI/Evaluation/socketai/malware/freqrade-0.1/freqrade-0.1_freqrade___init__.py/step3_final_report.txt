  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reads from environment variables, stdin, or files; potential dynamic execution; hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow into network, system commands, or output functions; dynamic execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment, stdin, hardcoded strings) to sinks (network, system commands, dynamic eval/exec).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded strings, no input validation, ambiguous data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions and hardcoded strings, which could be exploited maliciously. No direct evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or reverse shells is observed, but the presence of eval/exec and unvalidated data sources introduces potential security concerns. The overall structure suggests possible misuse but not confirmed malware. The scores reflect cautious suspicion, with malware at 0.2 and risk at 0.3, justified by ambiguous elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no confirmed malicious behavior but contains suspicious constructs that warrant cautious scoring. The malware score remains low (0.2), and the risk score is slightly elevated (0.3) due to potential for misuse. No obfuscation detected. Overall, the dependency appears benign but with minor concerns that should be monitored.",
