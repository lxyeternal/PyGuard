{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or manipulation tasks, potentially involving user input and file operations.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external files read at the start of the script.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print, write to files, network requests, or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, possibly with transformations or validations.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, unusual obfuscated code, or dynamic execution like eval/exec. Look for suspicious network connections or data exfiltration code.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review of the code reveals standard data handling procedures with no obfuscated functions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or malicious patterns detected. The code does not contain dangerous functions like eval or exec in suspicious contexts. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of malicious backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious data exfiltration. The flow seems typical for a data processing script, with input being processed and output generated accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, following standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
