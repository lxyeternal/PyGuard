{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'py-pushcc' with some package metadata, but also contains hidden malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading the existence of 'tahg' directory, environment variables, and possibly the import of subprocess and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with encoded command, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory existence -> if not found, run encoded PowerShell command -> proceed with setup of package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command in subprocess.Popen, which is hidden and potentially malicious. The code attempts to execute a command that is encoded and not human-readable. The try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding failures. The presence of hardcoded email and package details is normal, but the encoded command is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils.core and then tries to import subprocess and os. It checks for the existence of a directory 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is a common technique to conceal malicious payloads. This command could potentially download or execute malicious content. The setup function is called to package a Python library, which appears benign but may be a cover for malicious activity. The try-except blocks prevent error reporting, making detection harder. Overall, the encoded subprocess call is the main concern, indicating potential malicious activity that could compromise the system or perform unwanted actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code combines normal package setup procedures with a hidden, encoded PowerShell command that executes without visibility, indicating malicious intent. The use of encoded commands and suppression of errors strongly suggests malicious behavior, possibly as part of a supply chain attack or backdoor mechanism.",
