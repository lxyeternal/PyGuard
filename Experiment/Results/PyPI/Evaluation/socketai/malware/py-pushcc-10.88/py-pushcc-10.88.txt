      "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The suspicious URL, obfuscation, and silent execution suggest the code is compromised or malicious. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be flagged for further investigation. The malware potential is significant, and caution is advised."
