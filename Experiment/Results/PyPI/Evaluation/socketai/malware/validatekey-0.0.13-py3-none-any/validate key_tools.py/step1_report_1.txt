{
  "purpose": "The script extracts cookies related to Roblox from various browsers and sends the collected data to a Discord webhook for logging or potential malicious use.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers using the browser_cookie3 library; reads system information such as hostname, IP, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to a Discord webhook; writes cookie data and system info to a log file; continuously posts data every 3 hours.",
  "flows": "Browser cookies are retrieved and parsed; system info is gathered; data is formatted and sent to Discord webhook; cookies are periodically collected and sent in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "Persistent loop sending cookie data every 3 hours without user consent; hardcoded Discord webhook URL; no authentication or verification of data being sent; collection and exfiltration of cookies related to Roblox; storage of log data locally without encryption; no user notification or consent mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code collects cookies specifically associated with Roblox from multiple browsers, which could be used for unauthorized account access. It then formats this data along with system info and sends it to an external Discord webhook. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and continuous background execution suggest malicious intent, such as exfiltrating sensitive information without user knowledge. The script operates silently, storing logs locally and sending data periodically. These behaviors align with typical data theft or spyware activities. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present, but the purpose of stealing cookies and sending them externally is inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to stealthily collect user cookies related to Roblox from multiple browsers and exfiltrate them to an external Discord webhook, indicating malicious intent focused on credential theft. It operates covertly with persistent background execution, without user consent, which classifies it as malicious software.",
