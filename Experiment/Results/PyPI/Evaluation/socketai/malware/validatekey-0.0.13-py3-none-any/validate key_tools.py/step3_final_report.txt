{
  "purpose": "The code collects Roblox cookies from multiple browsers, gathers system info, and exfiltrates this data periodically via a Discord webhook without user consent, indicating credential theft and privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "browser_cookie3 functions for chrome, firefox, opera, brave; socket for hostname/IP; os for username; hardcoded webhook URL; local file storage.",
  "sinks": "DiscordWebhook's execute method transmitting data; file writing to local cache; string parsing of cookies.",
  "flows": "Sources (cookie retrieval, system info) → data formatting → webhook payload → webhook execution; also local file write operations.",
  "anomalies": "Straightforward code with no obfuscation; persistent infinite loop; silent operation; hardcoded webhook; cookie parsing via string split which may be brittle.",
  "analysis": "The script targets Roblox cookies across browsers, collects system info, and exfiltrates this data every 3 hours via a hardcoded Discord webhook, operating silently in an infinite loop. It stores logs locally without user notification. The cookie extraction relies on string splitting, which is brittle but does not affect malicious intent. No obfuscation or destructive payloads are present. The behavior indicates credential theft and stealthy exfiltration, with high privacy and security risks. The code's purpose is malicious, designed for credential theft, with persistent operation and external data transmission. The malware score should be high (around 0.9), and the security risk similarly high (around 0.9). The obfuscated score remains 0 as the code is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, operating persistently and stealthily without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by its behavior of exfiltrating sensitive data to an external server. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but its purpose is clearly malicious.",
