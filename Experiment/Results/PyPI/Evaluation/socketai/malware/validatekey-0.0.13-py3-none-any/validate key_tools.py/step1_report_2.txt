{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract cookies from various browsers for the domain 'roblox.com', log system information, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook at regular intervals.",
  "sources": "System hostname, IP address via socket; Browser cookies for roblox.com via browser_cookie3; User login information from os.getlogin()",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL where data is sent; Cookie data stored temporarily in a file before transmission",
  "flows": "System information (IP, hostname, cookies) is gathered and formatted into a string, then sent to a Discord webhook; This process repeats every 3 hours in a continuous loop",
  "anomalies": "The script collects cookies from multiple browsers for a specific domain without user consent and transmits system information and cookies to an external server; It stores logs in a hidden cache directory; The cookies are parsed via string splitting which might be error-prone but not suspicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a cookie stealer targeting roblox.com cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers. It also gathers system info such as hostname and IP address. It creates a cache directory and logs data periodically to a Discord webhook, including the cookies and system info. The repeated transmission every 3 hours indicates an automated exfiltration setup. No obfuscation or malicious code for system control is evident. The focus appears to be on stealthy data exfiltration rather than system damage or control.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate user cookies and system info to an external server via Discord webhook. It exhibits behavior typical of credential theft and privacy invasion tools. While it does not contain obvious destructive malware, its purpose aligns with malicious intent in terms of data theft.",
