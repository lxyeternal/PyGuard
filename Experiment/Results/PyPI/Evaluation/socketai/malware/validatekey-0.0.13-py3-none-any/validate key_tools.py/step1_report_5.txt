{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect browser cookies related to Roblox.com from various browsers and send the information to a Discord webhook, potentially for unauthorized tracking or credential theft.",
  "sources": "The code reads cookies from browser profiles for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers using the browser_cookie3 library.",
  "sinks": "The data is written to a log file and sent via a Discord webhook, which involves transmitting potentially sensitive cookie data over the network.",
  "flows": "Cookies are retrieved from browser profiles (sources), then stored temporarily in a log file, and finally sent to a remote Discord webhook URL (sink). The process repeats every 3 hours in a loop.",
  "anomalies": "The code lacks user consent prompts, does not sanitize or validate cookie data, and uses hardcoded webhook URL. It also targets specific cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) without user awareness, indicating potentially malicious intent. The continuous looping and automatic data exfiltration are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script collects cookies associated with Roblox from multiple browsers, which could contain sensitive authentication tokens. It then compiles this data into a formatted message and sends it to an external Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating user credentials without consent. The perpetual loop with a 3-hour delay suggests an intent to maintain persistent data collection. The code does not include any authentication or security checks, and hardcoded URLs increase the risk of misuse. Overall, this pattern aligns with credential-stealing malware or spyware designed to exfiltrate user data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by stealthily extracting sensitive browser cookies related to Roblox and transmitting them to a remote server via Discord webhook. It operates in an endless loop, indicating persistent data exfiltration without user awareness or consent. This poses significant security and privacy risks.",
