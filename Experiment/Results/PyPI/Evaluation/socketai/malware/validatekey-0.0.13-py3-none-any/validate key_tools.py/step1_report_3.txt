{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect cookies from browsers for Roblox.com and send system info and cookies to a Discord webhook at regular intervals.",
  "sources": "Reads browser cookies (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) for roblox.com, and system information such as hostname, IP address, and username.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via Discord webhook, including cookies and system info, with the ability to attach files containing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Sources (browser cookies, system info) are gathered and formatted into messages and files, which are then transmitted to the Discord webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code continuously collects and exfiltrates cookies every 3 hours without user consent, stores logs in a specific directory, and uses a hardcoded webhook URL. It does not sanitize or encrypt data before transmission. The code is designed for stealthy exfiltration of sensitive information.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves cookies from multiple browsers specifically for roblox.com, potentially targeting user credentials for malicious purposes. It logs system information such as hostname, IP address, and username. Data is written into a log file and sent to a Discord webhook, which is hardcoded and potentially controlled by the attacker. The code runs in an infinite loop, exfiltrating data every 3 hours, indicating an intent to persistently harvest and leak user data without user awareness. The functions for cookie extraction parse cookie objects into strings and handle exceptions silently, avoiding crashes but still performing data exfiltration. No obfuscation is present, and the code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic, but its purpose is clearly malicious in intent, aimed at credential theft and stealthy data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for malicious data exfiltration by harvesting cookies from browsers for roblox.com and sending system info and cookies to a remote Discord webhook at regular intervals. It operates stealthily, storing logs locally and repeatedly exfiltrating data, which is characteristic of malicious spyware or credential stealer malware.",
