{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Roblox authentication cookies from various browsers, gather system information, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook at regular intervals.",
  "sources": "System information: socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), os.getlogin(); Browser cookies via browser_cookie3 (chrome, firefox, opera, brave).",
  "sinks": "DiscordWebhook's execute method sending data and files to a remote server; writing cookies and logs to local cache files.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, cookies) are collected in the exec() loop; data is formatted into strings; then sent via DiscordWebhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Persistent, automated collection of browser cookies related to Roblox, combined with continuous webhooks, suggests data exfiltration. No user consent or prompts observed.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, IP, and username, then retrieves Roblox cookies from multiple browsers using browser_cookie3. It stores logs locally and constructs detailed messages including the collected data. It then sends this data via Discord webhook every 3 hours in an infinite loop. The code lacks any user interaction or permission prompts, indicating it operates stealthily. It does not obfuscate its operations explicitly but uses standard Python features. The core activity appears to be the unauthorized collection of login cookies and system information for exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, primarily designed for data exfiltration of Roblox login cookies and system details without user consent. It could be used for credential theft or account hijacking. Its persistence and automated operation amplify its threat potential.",
