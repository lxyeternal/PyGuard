{
  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source dependency code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, potential eval/exec functions, external data reads",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., eval, network calls, file writes)",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec without explicit code, minimal or incomplete code snippets, no obfuscation detected, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign, straightforward code snippets with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence levels are high where code is present, and the malware scores are appropriately zero. The security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat, with slight caution in cases mentioning potential dynamic code execution but lacking concrete evidence. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, the code snippets are considered safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The security risk remains low, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are required.",
