{
  "purpose": "The code extracts Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and user data; takes screenshots; modifies Discord core files; kills Discord processes; and exfiltrates all gathered data via a webhook, indicating malicious intent for credential theft, system sabotage, and surveillance.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser storage files, local system files (e.g., Chrome login data, cookies), network responses, and local storage leveldb files for tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to webhook, writing to local files, modifying Discord core files, process termination (killing Discord processes), and executing code injection.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from local storage, decrypted, and then sent via network requests; code injection and process killing facilitate stealth and persistence; screenshots and file archives are also exfiltrated.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, process termination of Discord processes, code injection into Discord core files, decryption routines for credentials, stealthy file modifications, and screenshot capture.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multiple malicious activities: harvesting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info; decrypting stored credentials; modifying Discord and related files for injection; killing Discord processes to facilitate code injection; capturing screenshots; and exfiltrating all data via a hardcoded webhook. The activities are explicit, with no obfuscation, and align with typical malware behaviors such as credential theft, sabotage, and surveillance. The code's actions are consistent with high-severity malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for credential theft, system sabotage, and user surveillance. It performs multiple malicious techniques including data exfiltration, process hijacking, and code injection, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated.",
