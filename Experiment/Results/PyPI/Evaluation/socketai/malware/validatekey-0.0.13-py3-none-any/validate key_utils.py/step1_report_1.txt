{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and system information, then send it to a remote webhook, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (localappdata, appdata, temp), files from browser storage (leveldb, cookies), and network responses (IP info, Discord API). It also reads files from directories related to Discord and browsers.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, writes sensitive info to files, and manipulates browser and Discord data files. It also kills Discord processes and modifies core files for injection.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info flow from local storage (browser, Discord, Windows) through file reads and regex extraction, then are transmitted over the network via requests to the webhook. It also performs code injection and process termination.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded webhook URL, attempts to modify Discord core files for injection, kills Discord processes, and extracts tokens and passwords stealthily. It creates and deletes files without user consent and takes screenshots, indicating malicious intent. Bypasses some protections like BetterDiscord modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical information-stealing malware with capabilities to extract Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and system info. It modifies Discord core files for injection, kills Discord processes to facilitate injection, takes screenshots, and exfiltrates all collected data via a webhook. It demonstrates techniques commonly used in malicious surveillance and data theft. No benign or security-related functionalities are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation or encryption but employs multiple methods for stealth and persistence, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a token and data stealer targeting Discord and browser data, with additional capabilities for injection, process termination, and information exfiltration. Its intent appears to be covert surveillance and credential theft, with no legitimate or benign purpose.",
