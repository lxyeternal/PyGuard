{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive information from the user's system, including browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and system information, and then exfiltrate this data to a remote Discord webhook. It also takes a screenshot of the user's desktop.",
  "sources": "User input data such as environment variables, file system reads for Chrome passwords, cookies, and leveldb files for tokens, and system info via IPinfo API.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to send exfiltrated data via Discord webhook, requests to Discord API endpoints with tokens, and reading/writing files for storing stolen data.",
  "flows": "System data is collected from environment variables and file reads, then processed for sensitive info like passwords, cookies, tokens. Data is then sent over network requests to external webhooks and API endpoints, with a ZIP archive created for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains functions for stealing browser credentials, cookies, Discord tokens, and system info, and then exfiltrates the data to a webhook. It also modifies Discord and BetterDiscord files to insert malicious code or disrupt normal operation. It kills Discord processes and modifies Discord injection scripts, indicating malicious intent. The script also captures screenshots of the user's desktop. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and specific user paths, as well as the behavior to log out the user from Discord, further suggest malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive information stealer, designed to harvest Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and system information, and then exfiltrate the data to a specified webhook. It also attempts to disable or disrupt Discord by killing processes and injecting malicious scripts into Discord core files. The script manipulates files for BetterDiscord to interfere with its operation. It captures screenshots and zips the collected data for exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded webhook, process-killing routines, and data harvesting from multiple sources are typical of malware targeting user privacy and security. Overall, all actions aim to collect sensitive data surreptitiously and send it to an attacker-controlled endpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code is clearly malicious, functioning as a data stealer and system disruptor targeting Discord and browser credentials, with exfiltration to a remote webhook. It performs multiple malicious activities, including process termination, file injection, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration, confirming high malicious intent.",
