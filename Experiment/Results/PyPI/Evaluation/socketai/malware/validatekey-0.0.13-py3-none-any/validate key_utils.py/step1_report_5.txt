{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract sensitive information such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and other user data from a compromised system, then exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook, including screenshots and zipped files.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, local files (Chrome Local State, leveldb files, Discord storage directories), system processes (psutil), and network requests to external APIs (ipinfo.io, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, user info, and system information are sent to a remote webhook. Data exfiltration occurs through requests to the Discord webhook URL, as well as sending files (zip and screenshots) via POST requests.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from various sources (local storage, environment variables, network responses), decrypted or parsed, then transmitted over the network to the specified webhook. Files and screenshots are compressed and sent after data collection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains clear malicious intent with data theft, token harvesting, screenshot capture, process termination of Discord, and injection of malicious scripts into Discord directories. It also bypasses security by modifying Discord files and deleting artifacts after execution. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating control over data exfiltration. The code uses obfuscated or misleading comments and variable names to disguise its intent.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a credential and data stealer targeting Discord users. It attempts to extract login credentials from Chrome, collect Discord tokens, gather user info, and capture screenshots. It also kills Discord processes, modifies Discord injection scripts, and exfiltrates all gathered data to a Discord webhook. The code structure is straightforward but malicious in purpose, with no legitimate functionality or user consent. The use of environment variables, system file manipulation, and network requests confirms malicious behavior. It leverages multiple techniques to evade detection and maximize data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and personal data, then exfiltrate this information to an attacker-controlled webhook. It also sabotages Discord applications and covers tracks by deleting temporary files. The overall security risk is extremely high, and this package should not be used or trusted.",
