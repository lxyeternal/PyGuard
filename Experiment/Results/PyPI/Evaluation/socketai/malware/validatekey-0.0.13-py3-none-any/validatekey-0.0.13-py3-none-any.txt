      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox cookies, operating persistently and stealthily without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by its behavior of exfiltrating sensitive data to an external server. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but its purpose is clearly malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed for credential theft, system sabotage, and user surveillance. It performs multiple malicious techniques including data exfiltration, process hijacking, and code injection, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated."
