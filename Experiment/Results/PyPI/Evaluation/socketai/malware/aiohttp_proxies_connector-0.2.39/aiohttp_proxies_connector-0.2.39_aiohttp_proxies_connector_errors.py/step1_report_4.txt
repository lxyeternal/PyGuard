{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are just definitions without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; only exception class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard exceptions. There are no functions, input handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple error class hierarchy for SOCKS proxy errors. It contains no malicious or suspicious content, and the risk is negligible.",
