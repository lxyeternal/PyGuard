  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Socks proxy connections and authentication.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class definitions with no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from base exception classes. There are no input sources, data processing, or external data outputs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The structure follows conventional exception subclassing for error handling in a Socks proxy context. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward set of custom error classes intended for use elsewhere in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides custom exceptions for error handling but contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
