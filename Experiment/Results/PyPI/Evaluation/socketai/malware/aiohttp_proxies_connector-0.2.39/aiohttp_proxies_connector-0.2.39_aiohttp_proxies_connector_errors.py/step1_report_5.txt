{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output flow present in class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. These classes are likely used elsewhere in an application to handle specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxies and connections. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No external inputs, outputs, or sensitive data handling is present in this snippet. The code structure is straightforward, following standard Python class declaration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application focused on SOCKS proxy handling. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident.",
