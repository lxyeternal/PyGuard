{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or untrusted data pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations without any unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exceptions. No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions typical for error handling in network-related modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward set of custom exception definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of a larger error management system and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
