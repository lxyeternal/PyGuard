{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors, serving as error handling mechanisms within a network module.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions; no external data input or output observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; the code solely establishes exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; the code only sets up exception hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class declarations for exception handling, with no network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious features justify these assessments. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a SOCKS proxy module. It contains no malicious or suspicious features, and the assessments and scores across reports are accurate and appropriate.",
