  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and typical for error handling modules.\n\n**Assessment of Issues and Risks:**\n- **Code presence:** The code is just class definitions, with no active logic or data processing. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security risk:** Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no active or sensitive operations, the security risk score is 0, which seems accurate.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The scores assigned in each report are consistent and reasonable.\n- Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified based on the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Potential for Higher Risk or Malware:**\n- Since the code is purely definitional, there is no basis for increasing the malware score.\n- The reports correctly identify that no malicious or suspicious behavior exists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is a standard set of exception classes with no security concerns.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThis code fragment is benign and serves as part of a larger error handling framework. It does not pose any security threat or contain any malicious intent.",
