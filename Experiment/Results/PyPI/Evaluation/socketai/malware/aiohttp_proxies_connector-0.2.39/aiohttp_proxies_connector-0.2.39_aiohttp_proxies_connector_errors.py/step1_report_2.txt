  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. No functions, data handling, or external interactions are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as structured error types. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
