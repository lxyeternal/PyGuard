  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard error class hierarchies, typical in network-related modules.\n\n**Specific Review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward class declarations inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n   - No actual logic, data processing, or network interactions are included.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that these are simple exception class definitions with no suspicious content.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need for justification.\n   - If any report had assigned higher scores, I would scrutinize whether the reasoning justified such risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely definitional.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code fragment poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. It serves as part of a typical error handling system in a SOCKS proxy module.",
