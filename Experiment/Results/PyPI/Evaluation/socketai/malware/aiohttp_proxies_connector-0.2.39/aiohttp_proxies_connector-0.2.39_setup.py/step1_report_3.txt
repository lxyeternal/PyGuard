{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with metadata and dependencies, then dynamically creates and executes several Python scripts embedded as base64-encoded strings, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables ('USERPROFILE'), reading Python package files (__init__.py), sys.argv for command-line arguments, and embedded base64-encoded scripts written to files.",
  "sinks": "Executing created scripts via subprocess (run function), writing to files in temp directories, potentially executing arbitrary code from decoded base64 content.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, package files) lead to decoding base64-encoded scripts which are written to files and executed via subprocess, enabling dynamic code execution from embedded scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of large base64-encoded code blocks written into files and then executed; creation of files in temp directories; commented-out code for reading command-line args; use of 'shell=True' in subprocess, which can be dangerous; environmental variable usage for temp paths; no clear documentation or purpose of embedded scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info, checking Python version, and setting metadata. However, it then defines functions that decode base64-encoded strings into Python code and write them into files in a temporary directory. These scripts are then executed via subprocess with potentially unsafe creation flags and shell execution. The embedded scripts contain code that appears to set environment variables, handle tokens, create directories, and perform network-related activities, possibly for remote control or data exfiltration. The use of try-except blocks around the decoding and execution further suggests an attempt to hide or prevent easy detection of malicious activity. The commented-out parts, combined with the obfuscated style and dynamic execution, strongly suggest malicious intent, such as executing hidden payloads, establishing remote connections, or exfiltrating data.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a downloader and executor of additional scripts embedded as base64 strings, which contain network and system manipulation code. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and location of scripts in temporary directories are characteristic of malicious payload delivery. Overall, this package exhibits high malicious behavior risk due to embedded code meant for covert execution and potential data exfiltration.",
