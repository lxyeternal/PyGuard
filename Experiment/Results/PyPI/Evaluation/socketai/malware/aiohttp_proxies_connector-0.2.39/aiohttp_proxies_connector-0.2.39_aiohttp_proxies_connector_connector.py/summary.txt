  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External dependencies are potential vectors if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The overall security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily considering external functions."
