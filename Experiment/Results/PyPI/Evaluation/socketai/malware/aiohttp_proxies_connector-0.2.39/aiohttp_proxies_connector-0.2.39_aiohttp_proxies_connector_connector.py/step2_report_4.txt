  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided summaries.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code implements a customizable proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting different proxy types, custom DNS resolution, and socket handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- External functions like `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are used, but their implementations are not shown. Their behavior could influence security, but based on their naming and typical usage, they seem standard.\n- The code's logic appears consistent and aligned with common proxy connection practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's intent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes socket creation and connection flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, which seems reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk:** Slightly elevated risk score (0.2) for handling user input and external functions, but no significant concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices.\n- Correctly notes the absence of secrets or obfuscation.\n- Appropriately assigns malware score 0.\n- Risk score remains low at 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on standard proxy connection setup.\n- Correctly identifies no malicious patterns.\n- Malware score 0, risk 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confident in the legitimacy.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Highlights the support for proxy types and configuration.\n- Notes the external functions and socket creation.\n- No suspicious behavior detected.\n- Malware score 0, risk 0.1, which is reasonable given the external dependencies.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Emphasizes the configurable nature and the use of custom DNS resolver.\n- Recognizes that `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are external.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score 0, risk 0.2, consistent with the previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.2 or 0.1, reflecting minor concerns about handling user input and external functions, but nothing alarming.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mainly due to external dependencies and user input handling.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The external functions' security depends on their implementation, but based on the provided code, no issues are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. I concur with their assessments and scores, with a slight adjustment to risk scores remaining low.",
