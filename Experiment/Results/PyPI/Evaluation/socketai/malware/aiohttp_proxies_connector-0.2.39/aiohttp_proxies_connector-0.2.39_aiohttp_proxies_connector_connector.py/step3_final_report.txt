{
  "purpose": "Implements a customizable proxy connector supporting various proxy types, DNS resolution options, and socket handling for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters, external functions create_socket_wrapper and parse_proxy_url, user-provided proxy URL and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Socket creation and connection, proxy URL construction, network communication via sockets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> proxy_url property -> socket wrapper creation -> connection establishment -> data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External functions' implementations are unknown, which could influence security but are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector with support for different proxy types and custom DNS resolution. It constructs proxy URLs carefully, manages socket creation, and handles connection setup appropriately. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. External functions could pose risks if malicious, but based on their naming and usage, they appear standard. The use of NoResolver to bypass DNS is notable but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code aligns with typical proxy handling practices and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External dependencies are potential vectors if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The overall security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily considering external functions.",
