{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py module for a proxy handling package, importing internal components and defining exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module imports and the version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module imports to the __all__ export declaration; no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization file, importing classes and functions from local modules and setting version and export variables. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets indicates benign intent. The minimal version string does not introduce security concerns. All signals point to a safe, straightforward setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, security risk near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
