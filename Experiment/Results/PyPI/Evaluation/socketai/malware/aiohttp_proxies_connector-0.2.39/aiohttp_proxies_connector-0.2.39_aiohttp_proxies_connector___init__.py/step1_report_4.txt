{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module for handling proxy connections, including importing relevant components and exposing an API for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present within this snippet; the code primarily sets up imports and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on imports and API definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization script, importing components and exposing public API elements. There are no functions or logic that handle data or perform operations beyond module setup. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are observed. The structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup script for a proxy handling library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
