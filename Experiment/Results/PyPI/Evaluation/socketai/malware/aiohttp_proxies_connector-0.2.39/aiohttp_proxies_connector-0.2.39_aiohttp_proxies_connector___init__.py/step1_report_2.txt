{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for establishing proxy connections, importing various classes and functions related to SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), likely reading data from these modules during execution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this code snippet; potential sinks could be invoked when using imported functions or classes elsewhere, but not in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No active data flow is evident in this fragment; the code primarily sets up imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward, consisting of imports and module metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and functions, and sets __all__ for exports. It does not execute any logic, perform data handling, or contain network operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization file, setting up imports and exports for a proxy handling library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.",
