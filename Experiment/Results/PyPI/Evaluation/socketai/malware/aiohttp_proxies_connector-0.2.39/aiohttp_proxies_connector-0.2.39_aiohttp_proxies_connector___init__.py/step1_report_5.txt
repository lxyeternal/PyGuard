{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that implements a SOCKS proxy client, providing classes, error handling, and helper functions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data inputs or user inputs are explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data is sent or received over network or other I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines imports, constants, and exports but does not execute data flows or handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module metadata (__version__), imports specific classes, functions, and constants from local modules, and sets the __all__ attribute for exports. It appears to be a straightforward, standard module setup without any embedded malicious code or malicious patterns. No external inputs, untrusted data handling, or network operations are present. The code does not contain any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
