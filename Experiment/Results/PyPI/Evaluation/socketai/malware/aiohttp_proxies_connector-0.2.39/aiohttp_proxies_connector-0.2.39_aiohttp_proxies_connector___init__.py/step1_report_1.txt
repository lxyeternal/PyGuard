{
  "purpose": "This module appears to facilitate proxy connections, likely providing a client interface to connect through SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), which are not included in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data within this snippet; the code mainly defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No active data flow is visible in this code snippet; it only re-exports components and sets versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules related to proxy handling, errors, and helpers. It defines a version string and an __all__ list for exports. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data handling visible. The code appears to serve as an entry point or package interface without any malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__ file used for organizing exports. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical setup for a Python package, and nothing in the snippet suggests malicious intent or security concerns.",
