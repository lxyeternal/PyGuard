{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports, version information, and exported symbols for a proxy connection module, facilitating proxy handling and error management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the setting of the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of module-level variables and imports without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns observed. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of import statements, error class definitions, and exports. There are no dynamic evaluations, network calls, or handling of external data. The version string is hardcoded but harmless. The module seems to serve as a library component for proxy handling, with no suspicious activity or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a standard Python module interface for proxy-related functionalities. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected based on this fragment.",
