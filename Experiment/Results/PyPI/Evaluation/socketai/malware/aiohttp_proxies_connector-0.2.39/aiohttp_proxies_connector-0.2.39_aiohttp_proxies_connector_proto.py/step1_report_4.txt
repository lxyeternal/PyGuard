{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous connection and negotiation through proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from network sockets (_loop.sock_recv, _loop.sock_sendall), user-provided parameters such as host, port, username, and password, as well as potentially resolved addresses from DNS or local resolution.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to network sockets (_loop.sock_sendall) and reads from them, potentially handling untrusted data from DNS resolution or proxy responses. It processes hostnames and addresses, and sends authentication credentials (username, password).",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters (host, port, username, password) to network sockets during negotiation; DNS resolution flows from input hostnames to socket addresses; proxy server responses flow back from the network to the code, potentially containing error codes or address data.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes handling of various proxy error codes, with detailed exception raising, which is standard. There is no hardcoded credential or secret. The code’s primary concern is proxy negotiation, and no suspicious obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden code structures are evident. No command execution, data exfiltration, or system manipulation behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy communication protocols (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), with proper handling of address resolution, authentication, and response parsing. Error handling maps proxy error codes to messages. The functions use async IO properly, and no suspicious or malicious logic such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access mechanisms are present. All data flows are consistent with proxy connection establishment. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code segments are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asynchronous use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic and data flows align with normal proxy negotiation procedures.",
