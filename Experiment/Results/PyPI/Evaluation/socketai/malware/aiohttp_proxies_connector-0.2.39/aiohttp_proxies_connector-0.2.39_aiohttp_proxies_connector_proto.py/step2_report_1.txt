  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and evaluating the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious code. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is a standard implementation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2 (moderate, considering network code).\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy implementation, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious external interactions. The confidence is 0.9, malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code handles proxy negotiation securely and straightforwardly.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.1 (low).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code supports multiple proxy types, with standard socket operations, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The confidence is 0.9, malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers with standard error handling, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation. The confidence is 0.9, malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code's data flows are typical for proxy negotiation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Confidence at 0.9, malware and obfuscated scores at zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code. No suspicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—standard proxy negotiation routines with no malicious payloads or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting typical network code risk. Given the nature of the code, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to network operations, but acceptable for such code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent with the code. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
