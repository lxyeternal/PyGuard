  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, with no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. It handles network communication securely and follows protocol specs.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, proper error handling, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n- **Justification:** The assessment aligns with the code's straightforward nature. The lower risk score (0.1) is justified, indicating minimal security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation with no malicious indicators. It emphasizes correct handling of network operations and protocol compliance.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The code is consistent with typical SOCKS proxy clients. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious behavior, standard handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's functionality. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose as a SOCKS proxy client, which inherently involves network operations and handling user credentials, a low to moderate risk score is appropriate. Since there's no suspicious activity, a score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned across all reports are consistent with the code's analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
