  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients for asyncio, handling connection, negotiation, and error cases. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, and no suspicious activity is identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming a standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature; the low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous reports.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation with proper error handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Fits the code's characteristics.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SOCKS proxy wrappers, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It’s a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxies.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or suspicious external domain calls.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The functions follow standard protocols and error handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the code's function and the thorough review, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** — very low, reflecting that it's a standard, legitimate implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The current scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining them with a slight adjustment to the risk score to 0.1 for clarity.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a low security concern, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
