  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients supporting asyncio, handling connection negotiation, address resolution, and error management.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy connection, destination address resolution, socket send/recv functions.",
  "sinks": "Network socket communication with proxy server and destination, data transmitted during negotiation and data forwarding.",
  "flows": "Input host/port -> resolve address -> connect to proxy -> negotiate authentication and connection -> establish tunnel to destination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code follows standard protocols and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers using asyncio. It manages socket connections, address resolution, and protocol negotiation correctly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and adheres to expected standards. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent network operation risks but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend maintaining a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score of 0.1, indicating minimal security concern.",
