{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling asynchronous connection to proxies and routing traffic through them.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters for host, port, username, password, and address resolution functions. Data is read from network sockets during the negotiation process.",
  "sinks": "Sends constructed request bytearrays to proxy servers; receives responses from the proxy server for validation and connection setup.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> address resolution or direct IP processing -> request construction and sending -> response reception and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code handles network and proxy negotiation securely with standard practices. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical asyncio-based socket communication patterns for SOCKS proxy negotiation. It constructs requests according to SOCKS protocol specifications, handles address resolution, and manages network errors properly. The error handling is standard, with no evidence of malicious intent. No embedded commands, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected. All data flows appear consistent with proxy negotiation routines, with no signs of data leakage or unintended data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio environments. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. Its functions are consistent with proxy communication, and no anomalies indicative of sabotage or malware are identified.",
