{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating proxy connections in an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials for proxy connection; getaddrinfo for DNS resolution; input parameters to connect methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through socket.sendall(), receive operations, and DNS resolution via getaddrinfo; potential for untrusted data to influence network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows through address resolution and socket connection functions; data sent to proxy server during negotiate methods; responses processed to establish proxied connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; code uses standard libraries and patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features; exception handling appears standard. No dynamic code execution or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines asynchronous socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, handling network communication, DNS resolution, and authentication. It validates responses from proxies and manages connections securely. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, is apparent. The code appears to implement standard proxy negotiation procedures without any signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous operations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard network operations and exception handling, and no hidden or malicious logic is detected.",
