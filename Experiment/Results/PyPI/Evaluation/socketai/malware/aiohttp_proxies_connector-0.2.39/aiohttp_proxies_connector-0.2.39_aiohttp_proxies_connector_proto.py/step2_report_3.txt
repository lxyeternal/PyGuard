  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to verify accuracy and consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the code as implementing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies with asyncio, matching the code's classes and functions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. Correctly notes standard request/response handling, error management, and no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is legitimate with high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — seems reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly states the code implements SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with proper data flow.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; standard error handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately sees no malicious intent, high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — aligns with the assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the code's function and data sources/sinks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and standard handling of proxy negotiation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code appears legitimate with high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly summarizes the code's proxy connection functions and data flow.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment of a standard, safe implementation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Appropriately describes the code as SOCKS proxy wrappers supporting asynchronous operations.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is legitimate with high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n- The risk scores are uniformly low (around 0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to network code complexity and potential misuse, but no specific vulnerabilities)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the thorough analysis provided.",
