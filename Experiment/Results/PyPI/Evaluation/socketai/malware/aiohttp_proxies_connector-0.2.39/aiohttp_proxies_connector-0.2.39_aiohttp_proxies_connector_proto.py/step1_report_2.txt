{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and network responses received via socket recv operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through socket sendall operations, especially during negotiation, authentication, and connection setup. Untrusted data can flow from network responses and user inputs to these sinks.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and credentials flow into address resolution and authentication steps; network responses from proxy servers are processed to determine success or failure; data flows from input sources to socket communication methods, and responses from proxies influence subsequent actions.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard proxy implementation with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unusual or obfuscated code segments are evident. No suspicious external domain or IP usage is present. Error messages are standard and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with common features such as address resolution, authentication, and error handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The logic handles network communication securely with proper error handling and does not perform any suspicious network connections or data exfiltration. It relies on standard libraries and patterns, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware. The code does not interact with any external suspicious domains or perform any malicious activities. It is a straightforward, standard implementation of SOCKS proxies, and nothing suspicious or malicious is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as intended for proxy communication, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
