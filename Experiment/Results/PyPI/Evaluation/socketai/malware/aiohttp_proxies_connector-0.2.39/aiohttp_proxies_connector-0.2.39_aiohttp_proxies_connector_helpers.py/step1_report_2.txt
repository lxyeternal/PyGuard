{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function (reads proxy URL), open_connection and create_connection functions (read host, port, proxy URL, and optional credentials).",
  "sinks": "socket connection establishment (connect method on socket wrappers), asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection (sending data over sockets).",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL and connection parameters → parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details → create_socket_wrapper creates proxy socket → connect to target host/port → return connected stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network behavior. The code appears to handle proxy connections securely and straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for establishing proxy connections using SOCKS proxies in an asyncio context. It securely parses proxy URLs, handles credentials safely via unquote, and uses provided asyncio mechanisms for network connections. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices are observed. The code structure and function usage are typical for network connection modules. All inputs are sanitized or validated. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate proxy connection utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It correctly manages network connections through SOCKS proxies without involving any malicious behaviors or backdoors. Security risks are minimal and typical for such functionality.",
