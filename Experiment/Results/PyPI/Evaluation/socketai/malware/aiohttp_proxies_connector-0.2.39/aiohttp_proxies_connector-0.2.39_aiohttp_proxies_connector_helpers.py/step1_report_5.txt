{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, parsing proxy URLs and configuring socket wrappers for connection establishment.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL in parse_proxy_url(); reading input parameters for host, port, socks_url, username, password, and loop; socket creation in create_socket_wrapper(); and connection establishment in open_connection() and create_connection().",
  "sinks": "The connect() method on socket wrappers; asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection() that send socket data over the network; and parsing functions that decode URLs and credentials.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url() extracts and decodes proxy credentials -> create_socket_wrapper() creates a socket based on proxy type -> connect() on socket wrapper to establish proxy connection -> open_connection()/create_connection() use socket to connect to target host/port and pass data through network functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward control flow. No obfuscated code, malware indicators, or secret leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles network connections through SOCKS proxies, parsing URLs and establishing connections accordingly. No suspicious or malicious code paths are detected. The functions follow typical patterns for proxy connection setup. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or unauthorized behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy handling with proper input validation and exception handling. The overall structure is standard and does not contain anomalies suggestive of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing SOCKS proxy connections with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for network proxy handling without exposing sensitive data or performing harmful operations.",
