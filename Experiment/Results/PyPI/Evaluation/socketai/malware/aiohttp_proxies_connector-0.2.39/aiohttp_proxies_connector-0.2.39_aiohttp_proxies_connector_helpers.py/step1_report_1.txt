{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and configuring socket wrappers.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL in parse_proxy_url; reading function arguments such as socks_url, host, port, username, password, loop, and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection where untrusted data can influence connection parameters; socket creation and connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input from parse_proxy_url or function arguments flows into create_socket_wrapper, which configures proxy sockets, then into asyncio connection functions for network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of untrusted user input for proxy configuration and connection parameters is expected. No suspicious or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed. The code appears structured and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies, with parsing of proxy URLs and dynamic socket creation. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling of sensitive info is detected. The code relies on standard libraries and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. It validates inputs and handles errors gracefully. There is no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is that user-supplied proxy URLs and connection parameters are used directly but this is typical for proxy configuration and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It handles input validation appropriately and does not include any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is low.",
