{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse proxy URLs, create SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, and establish network connections through SOCKS proxies asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, optional credentials, and configuration options like rdns and family.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection functions, and proxy socket connect methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port, credentials) are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers which connect to the proxy server, then establish a connection to the target host through the proxy.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard proxy connection handling, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly parses proxy URLs, validates inputs, creates appropriate SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 socket wrappers, and establishes connections asynchronously. It handles user input securely, with proper error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard proxy connection patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
