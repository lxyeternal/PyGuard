  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues based on provided code or reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic eval/exec calls, external dependencies, input/output functions, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file I/O, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points, external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input data received -> processed through functions -> potentially sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without validation, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious network domains, unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either no code or benign code with no suspicious patterns. Report 1 mentions potential eval/exec risks but finds no evidence of malicious activity; confidence is moderate (0.7). Reports 2-4 lack code, thus no analysis; scores are zero. Report 5 describes standard data processing with no obfuscation or malicious indicators; confidence is high (0.8). The scores across reports are consistent with the evidence, with malware scores at 0, obfuscation at 0, and low security risk (~0.2). Given the absence of confirmed malicious behavior, the overall assessment remains that the code is benign, with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code and reports show no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the cautious stance on eval/exec in Report 1 is appropriate. No changes to scores are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.",
