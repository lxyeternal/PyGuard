  "conclusion": "The overall security assessment indicates that only Report 2 presents significant suspicious activity, justified by its high malware and obfuscation scores. The remaining reports describe benign code with appropriate low-risk scores. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary beyond the justified suspicion in Report 2."
