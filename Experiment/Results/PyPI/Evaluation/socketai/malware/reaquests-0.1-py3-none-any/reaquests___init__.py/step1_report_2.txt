  "purpose": "The script extracts saved login credentials from Google Chrome, decrypts them, and uploads the data to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": [
    "os.getlogin() - retrieves the current username",
    "opening Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database file",
    "reading 'Local State' file for encryption key",
    "reading encrypted passwords from database",
    "reading the 'passwords.txt' file for upload"

  "sinks": [
    "sending 'passwords.txt' via POST request to Discord webhook",
    "writing decrypted passwords and credentials to local file",
    "deleting 'passwords.txt' after upload"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "retrieve username and file paths -> read encrypted login data -> fetch encryption key -> decrypt passwords -> save credentials to file -> upload file via webhook -> delete local file"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "hardcoded webhook URL, indicating potential exfiltration",
    "saving passwords to local file before uploading",
    "bypassing standard error handling with broad 'except' clauses",
    "lack of user consent or notification",
    "no validation or sanitization of data before transmission"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code accesses Chrome's stored login credentials by querying the 'Login Data' SQLite database and decrypts stored passwords using Windows cryptography functions and Chrome's local encryption key. It writes the credentials to a local file ('passwords.txt') and then uploads this file to a Discord webhook, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data. The use of broad exception handling and hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent or at least covert data theft. The code does not perform any user notification or authorization, suggesting malicious or unauthorized behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to extract and exfiltrate saved browser credentials without user consent, constituting malicious behavior. The hardcoded webhook URL and the process of capturing and transmitting sensitive data indicate potential malicious intent, possibly as part of malware or data theft toolkit.",
