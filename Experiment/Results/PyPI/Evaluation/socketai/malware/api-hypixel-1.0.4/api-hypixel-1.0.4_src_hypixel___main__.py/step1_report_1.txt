  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration files related to user accounts and send them to a dynamically fetched URL via webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading local configuration files from user directories; decoding and fetching a URL from a base64-encoded string; making HTTP GET request to retrieve the URL.",
  "sinks": "Sending potentially sensitive files' contents over an HTTP POST request to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Code reads local config files -> decodes URL from base64 -> makes HTTP GET request to fetch webhook URL -> sends config files to the fetched URL via POST.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64 string representing a URL; dynamic retrieval of webhook URL from remote server; the code is designed to exfiltrate user configuration files without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by decoding a base64-encoded string to obtain a URL, then performs an HTTP GET request to retrieve the webhook URL. It constructs paths to several user configuration files, reads their contents if they exist, and then sends these files to the fetched URL using a POST request with multipart encoding. This pattern indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive user data stealthily. No user prompts or permissions are requested, and the data is sent without user knowledge. The code structure is straightforward but contains obfuscated elements such as the base64 URL, suggesting malicious intent aimed at secret data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to exfiltrate sensitive user account configuration files by dynamically fetching a webhook URL and sending the data without user consent, indicating malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated URL decoding and automatic data transmission without explicit user action points to a high malicious intent score.",
