{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to silently exfiltrate user configuration files related to gaming accounts by fetching a remote URL and sending the data via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads local configuration files from user directories and decodes a base64-encoded URL to obtain the remote endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests, transmitting potentially sensitive user information.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a base64 URL, performs a GET request to retrieve the actual exfiltration endpoint, reads configuration files if they exist, and then POSTs their contents to the fetched URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the URL, dynamic URL retrieval at runtime, silent operation without user consent, and exfiltration of sensitive files.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64 string to obtain a URL, fetches the actual endpoint via an HTTP GET request, and if user configuration files are present, transmits their contents to that endpoint. This pattern indicates stealthy data exfiltration of sensitive user information, with obfuscation techniques employed to evade detection. The code operates silently, with no user prompts or permissions, and targets common configuration files related to gaming accounts, which may contain credentials or personal data. The behavior aligns with malicious activity aimed at privacy invasion and credential theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting sensitive user configuration data to a remote server. It employs obfuscation and dynamic URL fetching to evade detection, and its operation is silent and unauthorized. Therefore, it should be classified as high severity malware with significant security risks.",
