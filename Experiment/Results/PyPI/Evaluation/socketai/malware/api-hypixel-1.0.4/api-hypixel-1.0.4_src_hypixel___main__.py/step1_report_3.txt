{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves configuration files from user directories and sends their contents to a remote URL, potentially for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files from user directories such as 'accounts.json', 'microsoft_accounts.json', and 'launcher_accounts.json'.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to a URL obtained dynamically from a base64-encoded string decoded at runtime.",
  "flows": "File contents are read from specific paths, then encapsulated and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL obtained through a base64-decoded web request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate the URL, dynamic retrieval of the webhook URL from a remote server, and reading potentially sensitive user account files. The script operates stealthily, hiding its intent via obfuscation and dynamic URL fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by decoding a base64 string to obtain a URL, which it then requests to retrieve a JSON object containing another URL. This second URL is used as a webhook endpoint. The script locates specific configuration files in user directories, reads their contents, and if any are present, sends these files to the remote webhook via a multipart HTTP POST request. The purpose appears to be to exfiltrate user account information stored locally without explicit user consent, which is characteristic of malicious data theft. The obfuscation via base64 and the dynamic URL retrieval are typical anti-detection techniques, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration of sensitive user configuration files by retrieving a remote URL and sending user data stealthily. It demonstrates obfuscation and unauthorized data collection, indicating malicious behavior with high confidence.",
