{
  "purpose": "Decode a base64-encoded string and execute the decoded code, likely intended to run obfuscated or malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Reads the base64-encoded string assigned to variable 'b', then decodes it using base64.b64decode.",
  "sinks": "Executes the decoded code with exec(), which is a sink where malicious payloads can be executed directly.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded -> decoded code is executed via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding and exec() on decoded data, which is common in obfuscation and malicious payloads. The code content appears highly obfuscated with long base64 strings, which are decoded and immediately executed. No other suspicious imports or functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'base64' module as 'b' and decodes a large base64-encoded string. The decoded output is then run using exec(). The base64 string itself is highly complex, containing a large amount of data that, once decoded, will likely be a payload intended to execute arbitrary code. The use of base64 decoding followed by exec() is a strong indicator of obfuscation designed to hide malicious intent. The payload likely performs further malicious actions once executed. The code does not perform any other operations before decoding and executing, suggesting its primary purpose is to run concealed code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It employs common obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding + exec) to hide its true intent. The immediate execution of decoded code without any validation or safeguards poses a significant security risk. The overall risk score is high, and this package or code should be considered dangerous until further analysis confirms safety.",
