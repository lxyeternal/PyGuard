  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded script, likely for dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a hardcoded base64 string embedded directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded code, which is the main sink of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded via base64.b64decode(), then executed via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses base64 decoding followed by immediate execution, indicating obfuscation and potential concealment of malicious intent. The base64 string is very lengthy and complex, making manual analysis difficult. The structure suggests an intent to hide the actual malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only the 'base64' module, then decodes a lengthy base64 string which is immediately passed to exec(). The base64 string likely encodes further malicious code or commands intended to run on the host system. The use of base64 encoding and exec() together is a common pattern in malicious scripts designed to hide their true payload and dynamically execute obfuscated code. No other suspicious behaviors (like network connections, file modifications, or credential usage) are directly visible in this snippet, but the pattern strongly indicates malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The initial analysis suggests the decoded code probably performs harmful actions once executed, such as system modifications, data exfiltration, or establishing backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscated nature and the immediate execution of decoded content. It is likely malicious, designed to conceal its true behavior and perform harmful operations upon execution. The use of base64 decoding plus exec() indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
