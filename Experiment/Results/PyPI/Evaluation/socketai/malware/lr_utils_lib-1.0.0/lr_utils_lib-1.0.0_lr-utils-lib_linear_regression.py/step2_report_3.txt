  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of linear regression, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- The code uses numpy and pandas libraries for statistical calculations and data presentation.\n- No network, file, or environment interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The calculations and data flows are straightforward and transparent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears functionally correct for linear regression analysis.\n- **Malware presence:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior or malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification for higher risk? |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No malicious or suspicious activity. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0            | Same as above. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No signs of malicious intent. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0            | Clear, standard statistical code. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0            | No malicious or suspicious features. |\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is transparent, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security or malicious risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard statistical implementation, with no hidden or suspicious operations.\n- The consistent scoring across reports is appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, transparent, and free of malicious intent.",
