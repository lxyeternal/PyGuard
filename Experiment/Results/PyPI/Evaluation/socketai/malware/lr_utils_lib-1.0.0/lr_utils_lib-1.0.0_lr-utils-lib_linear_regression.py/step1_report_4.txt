{
  "purpose": "The code implements a linear regression analysis class for modeling relationships between variables, providing statistical metrics and results output.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through constructor parameters 'x' and 'y', and property setters for x and y. Data is stored as NumPy arrays.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results via print statements and returns DataFrames; no direct data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays to internal NumPy arrays, calculations are performed on these, results are generated for output without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly performs statistical calculations without unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class is a standard implementation of linear regression analysis with methods for computing slope, intercept, correlation, and standard errors. It uses properties for calculations and outputs results in readable formats. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and solely focused on statistical computation. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign statistical utility for linear regression analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware characteristics.",
