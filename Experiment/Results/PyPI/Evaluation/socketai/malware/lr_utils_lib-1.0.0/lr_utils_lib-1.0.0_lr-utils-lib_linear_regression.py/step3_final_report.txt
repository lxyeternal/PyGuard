{
  "purpose": "Implements a class for linear regression analysis, calculating slopes, intercepts, standard errors, and correlation coefficients, and providing formatted results.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class attributes __x and __y, set via constructor or property setters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data transmission or file/network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input attributes through calculations of regression parameters, with results generated for display or export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard statistical formulas and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard linear regression calculations using numpy, with properties for slope, intercept, and their standard errors, as well as correlation coefficients. It provides methods for generating results and formatted output. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The implementation is transparent and conventional, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of linear regression analysis. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
