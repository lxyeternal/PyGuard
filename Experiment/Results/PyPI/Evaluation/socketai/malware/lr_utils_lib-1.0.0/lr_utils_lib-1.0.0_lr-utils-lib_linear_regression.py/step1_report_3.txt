{
  "purpose": "Define a class for performing linear least-squares regression analysis with options for models with or without intercepts.",
  "sources": "Input data for x and y (constructor), potentially via property setters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code performs calculations and returns data structures or print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class initialization and property setting into internal variables, then through various calculation properties, culminating in result outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports beyond standard numerical and data handling libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements standard linear regression calculations, with properties for slopes, intercepts, correlation coefficients, and related statistics. It allows for models with fixed intercepts at zero and computes associated errors and metrics. No data is transmitted externally, nor are there apparent side effects or suspicious behaviors. The usage of numpy and pandas is standard for numerical analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure and logic appear typical for statistical modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of linear regression analysis with options for intercept settings. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
