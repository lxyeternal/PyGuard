{
  "purpose": "This code implements a linear regression analysis class, providing methods to calculate slopes, intercepts, correlation coefficients, and generate results summaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the constructor (__init__), and via property setters for x and y data arrays.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; outputs are formatted strings and dataframes derived from internal calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (__x and __y) through computations of statistical metrics; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. No use of dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations for linear regression without external data fetching, network communication, or malicious operations. It uses standard libraries (numpy, pandas) and computes regression metrics securely. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is evident. The structure and implementation are typical for a statistical analysis class, focusing solely on data processing and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of linear regression analysis without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk score is very low.",
