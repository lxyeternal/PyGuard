{
  "purpose": "This code implements a linear regression analysis class with methods for calculating and reporting various regression statistics.",
  "sources": "Input data for regression (x, y) provided during class instantiation or through property setters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code mainly performs mathematical computations and outputs results.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from class instantiation or setters to computation methods, then to output functions like print_results() and __str__(). No external data transmission or external code execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden backdoors identified. Use of property decorators and standard mathematical operations appear legitimate. No obfuscated code, code injection, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a linear regression class with methods to compute regression coefficients, standard errors, and correlation measures. It uses numpy and pandas for calculations and data reporting. All functions appear standard for statistical modeling, with clear and conventional implementation. No signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or hidden functionalities are evident. The class solely performs regression analysis and displays results.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of linear regression analysis with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate utility class for statistical computations.",
