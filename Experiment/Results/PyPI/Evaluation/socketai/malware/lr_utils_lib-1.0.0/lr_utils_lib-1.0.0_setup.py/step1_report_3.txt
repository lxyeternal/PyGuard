{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, primarily used for packaging and distribution of the 'lr-utils-lib' library. It also contains a custom installation procedure that performs additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded base64-encoded strings, external files within the package directory, and possibly from environment variables if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests made via HTTPS connections, reading files, and executing commands. Specifically, the code makes HTTP POST requests with data read from local files during the install process.",
  "flows": "The script decodes base64-encoded strings to generate URLs and request headers, then uses those to send POST requests with file data during installation if on macOS. The flow involves decoding strings, establishing HTTPS connections, reading files, and sending data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated base64 strings that decode into URLs, file paths, and data used for network requests. It constructs HTTP requests with data from files without validation. The repeated decoding and dynamic URL construction, combined with the network activity during installation, are suspicious. Also, the presence of hardcoded hash values and base64-encoded strings for URLs suggests possible malicious intent, such as exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions for dynamic imports and cryptographic hashing. It includes a list of hashes ('go') which are checked against a computed hash during the installation process. During the 'PyInstall' class run method, it performs environment-specific actions: decoding base64 strings, making HTTP connections, and posting data from files. The network activity occurs only on macOS platforms and involves sending contents of certain files to external URLs, which may be malicious. The setup function integrates this behavior into the package installation process. The code appears to be designed to secretly transmit local file data during installation, which is suspicious behavior. Despite the packaging purpose, the network activity and obfuscation indicate possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by performing network requests with data from local files during installation, using obfuscated strings and platform-specific conditions. This suggests it may be exfiltrating user data without clear user consent, indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to data exfiltration potential, with a malware score around 0.7 and security risk around 0.8.",
