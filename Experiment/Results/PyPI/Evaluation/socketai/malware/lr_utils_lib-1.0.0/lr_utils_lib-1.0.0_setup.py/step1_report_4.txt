{
  "purpose": "The script is primarily designed to set up a Python package, but it includes obfuscated code that contacts external servers, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hardcoded base64-encoded strings decoded at runtime, environment variables, and external network connections established through hardcoded URLs and dynamically generated connection objects.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests (con.request) and file reads. Specifically, the code reads files from user directories and sends their contents over the network.",
  "flows": "The code decodes base64 strings, constructs URLs, reads files from user directories, and makes HTTP POST requests to external servers with the file data, all triggered during the installation process if on macOS.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64-encoded strings decoded at runtime, dynamic network connections to external domains, reading potentially sensitive files from user directories, and sending their contents without clear user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup file for a Python package, but it contains obfuscated sections that decode strings and establish network connections. During installation on macOS, it constructs an HTTPS connection to an external server, reads files from the user's application data directory, and transmits these files via HTTP POST requests with specific headers. The URL and files are dynamically constructed using base64-encoded strings, which are decoded at runtime. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, especially as it occurs during package setup without explicit user awareness. The code also includes a shortcut for publishing the package but does not appear to relate to malicious intent. Overall, the code exhibits suspicious activity, including unauthorized data access and transmission, with obfuscated code hiding its true purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated network activity that accesses user files and sends their data to external servers during package installation, which strongly suggests malicious intent. The behavior resembles data exfiltration or backdoor activity, indicating a high security concern. The package should be considered unsafe until further review clarifies intent.",
