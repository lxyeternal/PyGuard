{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the standard installation process to perform network requests during setup, decoding obfuscated strings, and reading local files to send their contents to an external server, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Decodes base64 strings to generate URLs and file paths; reads files from user directories such as ~/.config/gcloud; executes subprocess commands that decode and run embedded base64 code.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via HTTPS to a hardcoded external domain, transmitting contents of local files; dynamic URL and string construction used to obfuscate data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Runtime decoding of base64 strings -> construction of URLs and file paths -> reading local files -> sending file contents over network during installation process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding for strings, dynamic import of modules, network activity during setup, reading user files without user consent, and obfuscated code patterns designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code employs runtime decoding of base64-encoded strings to construct URLs and file paths, then reads local files from user directories and transmits their contents via HTTPS requests during the installation process on macOS. The obfuscation techniques, such as dynamic imports and base64 encoding, support malicious intent. The network activity occurs during setup, indicating potential data exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded hash lists and the decoding of strings into URLs suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior. Given these behaviors, the code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious activity, specifically data theft and privacy invasion, with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including obfuscated network activity and data exfiltration during package installation. It should be flagged as malicious with high severity. The malware score is set to 0.85, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.9, reflecting the high confidence in its malicious intent and potential harm.",
