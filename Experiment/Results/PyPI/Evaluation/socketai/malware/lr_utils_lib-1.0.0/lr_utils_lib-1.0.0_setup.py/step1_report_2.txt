{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup file for a Python package, primarily used for configuring and installing the package, with some additional conditional behavior on macOS.",
  "sources": "Code reads from hardcoded byte-encoded strings, external modules (setuptools, subprocess, os), and potentially reads files from user directories based on encoded paths.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via HTTPSConnection to a hardcoded domain, reading files from user directories, and executing setup commands.",
  "flows": "Uses encoded strings to decode URLs and filenames, then makes POST requests to a specific server, potentially sending data read from files. The code runs the installation process conditionally, and may send system data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded strings decoded at runtime, code that performs network requests during installation, dynamic import functions, and a conditional on sys.platform. The base64 strings, especially in 'b64d', and the network request to a hardcoded URL are suspicious. The list 'go' of hashes appears to be used as a whitelist or check, but its origin isn't clear.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup.py for a package with obfuscated parts, notably the use of base64 decoding for URLs and paths. During installation on macOS, it decodes strings, performs network requests to a specific URL with data read from files in the user's directory, and transmits data via POST requests. This behavior suggests potential data exfiltration. The use of dynamic imports and hardcoded credentials/strings is suspicious. The network request occurs only during the 'run' method of the custom 'PyInstall' class, which is called during installation, indicating possible malicious intent. The code does not perform any malicious file modifications or destructive actions but collects and sends data. The inclusion of hardcoded hashes and decoding steps are typical of obfuscated, potentially malicious scripts intended to hide data exfiltration. Overall, the code exhibits signs of malicious behavior with data leakage mechanisms during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, runtime-decoded network activity that exfiltrates data during package installation on macOS, indicating malicious intent. It appears designed to secretly transmit user data via network requests during setup, fitting malware behavior patterns. The overall security risk is high.",
