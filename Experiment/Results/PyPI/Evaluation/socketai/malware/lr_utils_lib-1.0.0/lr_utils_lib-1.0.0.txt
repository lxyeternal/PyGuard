      "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, including obfuscated network activity and data exfiltration during package installation. It should be flagged as malicious with high severity. The malware score is set to 0.85, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.9, reflecting the high confidence in its malicious intent and potential harm."

The low malware and security risk scores reflect the absence of explicit malicious activity, with cautious suspicion in some cases. No major revisions are necessary; the overall supply chain security posture appears low risk."
