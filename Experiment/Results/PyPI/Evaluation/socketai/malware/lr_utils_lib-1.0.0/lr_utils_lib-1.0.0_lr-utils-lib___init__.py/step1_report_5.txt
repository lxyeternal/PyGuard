{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the import and potential execution of external modules, possibly for data processing or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during import statements and potentially from environment variables or input functions (if present), but no explicit data sources are shown due to absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execution functions such as eval(), exec(), or system calls, as well as network functions that send data or connect externally, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from input sources to sinks is visible in the provided snippet. If the code uses eval() or similar functions later, untrusted input could be processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns. No unusual or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is essentially empty with only import statements and no further logic or data handling. It does not demonstrate any suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. Without additional code, it's not possible to identify malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign skeleton or starting point with no malicious intent or anomalies detected.",
