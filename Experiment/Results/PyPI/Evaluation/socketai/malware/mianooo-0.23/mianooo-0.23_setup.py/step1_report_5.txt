{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process that includes a custom installation command which sends system hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), within the async function foo() that accesses the webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Webhook.send() function that transmits hostname and IP address to an external server.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method calls asyncio.run(foo()), which retrieves system info and sends it to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding a Discord webhook URL within installation code; immediate network activity during package install; the code does not validate or sanitize data before sending.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging modules and defines a custom install command. During installation, it asynchronously retrieves the system's hostname and IP address and sends this information to an external Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential data exfiltration without user consent. The network request occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. There is no user prompt, validation, or warning about this activity. The code uses asyncio to perform the network operation asynchronously within the install process, which is technically complex but not inherently malicious. However, the immediate transmission of system data to an external endpoint at install time suggests potentially malicious behavior, such as unauthorized system info collection and exfiltration. The package dependencies are standard, but the embedded webhook indicates malicious intent or at least privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address to an external webhook during package installation. This indicates a high potential for privacy violation and unauthorized data collection. The activity is hidden within a standard setup script, which is suspicious. Overall, this package demonstrates malicious intent and should be considered unsafe for use.",
