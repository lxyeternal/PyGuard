  "flows": "Sources (hostname, IP) -> webhook.send() via async function called during installation",
  "anomalies": "Execution of asynchronous network request during package installation; hardcoded webhook URL; sending system information (hostname and IP) without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, retrieves the system's hostname and IP address. It then asynchronously sends this information to a specific Discord webhook URL during the package installation process. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or at least undesirable data exfiltration. This behavior occurs automatically during install, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior, as it could be used to collect system information without user awareness. There are no user inputs or configuration options, and the use of asyncio and aiohttp is for the purpose of making an outgoing network connection. The rest of the setup code appears normal, with no other suspicious dependencies or code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to send system hostname and IP address to an external Discord webhook during package installation, which is suspicious and indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious activity. The hardcoded webhook URL and automatic data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent.",
