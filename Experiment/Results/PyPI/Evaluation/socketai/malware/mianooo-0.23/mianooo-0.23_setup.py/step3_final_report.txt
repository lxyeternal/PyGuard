  "purpose": "The code retrieves system hostname and IP address during installation and sends this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, performing automatic data exfiltration without user consent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), the hardcoded webhook URL in Webhook.from_url()",
  "sinks": "aiohttp.ClientSession() sending data to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "source (hostname/IP) -> webhook URL (sink) via asynchronous HTTP POST during the run() method of the custom install command",
  "anomalies": "Network activity (sending data to external server) during package installation, hardcoded webhook URL, no user notification or consent, use of asyncio.run() inside setup script",
  "analysis": "The code performs an unusual action during package installation by exfiltrating system hostname and IP address to an external Discord webhook. The webhook URL is embedded directly in the code, and the data is sent asynchronously without user awareness. This behavior is not typical for standard setup scripts and indicates privacy-invasive activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the network call is explicitly made during install. The high malware and security risk scores are justified due to the privacy invasion and potential misuse for tracking or malicious surveillance. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with a malware score around 0.9 and security risk near 0.9, reflecting the severity of the activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation via a hardcoded webhook, with no user consent. This constitutes a privacy invasion and potential malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The behavior should be flagged or removed from packages to prevent abuse.",
