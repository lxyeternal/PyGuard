{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package and, during installation, send the host's hostname and IP address to a specific Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname)",
  "sinks": "Webhook.from_url() and webhook.send() methods that transmit data to a remote server (Discord webhook)",
  "flows": "hostname/IP address obtained via socket functions → formatted string → sent through Discord webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code sends host information asynchronously during installation without user consent, which is unusual behavior. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or data exfiltration. The use of asyncio within a setup script to perform network operations at install time is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation command. During the run method of the custom install class, it retrieves the host's hostname and IP address. It then defines an asynchronous function that sends this information to a specific Discord webhook URL. The use of asyncio.run() executes this function during installation, which is unusual because package installation typically does not perform network communications. The webhook URL is hardcoded and points to an external service, which may indicate data exfiltration or malicious monitoring. There are no other malicious code components such as backdoors, system damage, or cryptomining. The code's primary suspicious element is the automatic transmission of system info during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unexpected network request during package installation, sending host information to an external webhook, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, especially given the hardcoded webhook URL and the silent data transmission.",
