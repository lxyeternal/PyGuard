{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step which sends system information to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname) - retrieves hostname and IP address; Webhook URL in CustomInstallCommand.run method.",
  "sinks": "Discord webhook URL used with aiohttp.ClientSession to send data; webhook.send method to transmit hostname and IP address.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code retrieves system hostname and IP, then asynchronously sends this information to an external Discord webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically transmits system hostname and IP address to a third-party Discord webhook during installation without user consent, which is suspicious. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools for package installation and extends the install command to include a network request. During the custom run method, it collects system hostname and IP address, then sends this data to a Discord webhook using aiohttp and asyncio. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code executes this network operation every time the package is installed. This behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious surveillance. There are no indications of obfuscation, backdoors, or other malicious payloads beyond the privacy-violating information transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unexpected and potentially malicious action by exfiltrating system information during package installation. The hardcoded webhook URL and automatic data transmission suggest malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The overall security risk is high, as it could be used for surveillance or data theft, and the malware score is also high due to the malicious nature of automatic info exfiltration.",
