      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation via a hardcoded webhook, with no user consent. This constitutes a privacy invasion and potential malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The behavior should be flagged or removed from packages to prevent abuse."
