  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command execution triggered during setup. The use of encoded commands, silent error handling, and conditional triggers strongly suggest malicious activity. The assigned scores (malware: 0.85, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.85) are justified and reflect a high threat level. The package should be flagged for further analysis or rejection until payload content is verified."
