{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy connection library, including error handling, connection functions, and proxy types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data; no network or data manipulation code present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily imports and module exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; no unusual code constructs or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The script mainly consists of import statements, constant definitions, and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It imports various components from local modules, suggesting this is part of a larger package. There are no functions, network operations, or data processing within this fragment. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects, is evident. The code appears to be a standard module setup for a proxy handling library.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
