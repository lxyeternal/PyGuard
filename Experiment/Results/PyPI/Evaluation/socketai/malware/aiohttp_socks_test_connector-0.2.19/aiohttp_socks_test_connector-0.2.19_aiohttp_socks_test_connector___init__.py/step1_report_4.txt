{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for handling SOCKS proxy connections, defining imports, version info, and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious output; no network, file, or environment variable usage present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and exposes components; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, importing and exporting symbols; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical module initializer that defines version info, imports, and exports. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or manipulate data in a way that could be malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The imports are from internal, presumably safe modules. Overall, the code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module initialization file for a proxy-related package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports components and defines exports, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
