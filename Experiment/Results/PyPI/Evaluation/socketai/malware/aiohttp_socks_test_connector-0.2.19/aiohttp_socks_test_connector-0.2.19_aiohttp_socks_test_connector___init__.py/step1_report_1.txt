{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module metadata, import necessary components, and specify public API exports for a proxy-related package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) which may contain further data input or processing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present in this snippet; no network, file, or environment interactions are directly shown.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports components and re-exports them, with no data flow or processing logic that could lead from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The version string and exports are standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module initialization file. It imports components related to proxy handling, error management, connection helpers, and protocol definitions, then exports them for external use. There are no input sources, data processing, or sinks that could be exploited. The code structure is clean, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It appears safe based on this fragment alone.",
