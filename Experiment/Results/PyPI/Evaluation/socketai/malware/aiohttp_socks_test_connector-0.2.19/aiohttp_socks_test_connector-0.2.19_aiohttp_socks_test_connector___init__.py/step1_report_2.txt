{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python library for handling proxy connections, specifically SOCKS proxies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes such as ProxyConnector, errors, helpers, and proto; does not read external input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module versioning, and defining __all__ for exports. It imports various classes and functions related to proxy connection handling. No external data input, no network communication, or security-sensitive operations are implemented here. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms within this fragment. It appears to be a standard, well-structured module setup for a proxy-related library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy connection library with no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It serves as an interface layer importing and exporting components without executing any suspicious behavior.",
