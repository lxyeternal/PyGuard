  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module initializer.\n- It imports components from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- It defines a version string and an `__all__` list for public API.\n- There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, likely SOCKS proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports describe the code as a simple module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. This matches the code's nature.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Are there errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify this as boilerplate module setup code with no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is correct. The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely import/export boilerplate, there's no justification for higher malware or risk scores.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- All reports assume this is just a module setup, which is correct. No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious behavior, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, considering it's a module setup, but not entirely zero since any code could theoretically be misused if integrated into a larger malicious package)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard module initializer for a proxy library.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores provided are appropriate and should remain at zero or near-zero.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; this code appears safe.",
