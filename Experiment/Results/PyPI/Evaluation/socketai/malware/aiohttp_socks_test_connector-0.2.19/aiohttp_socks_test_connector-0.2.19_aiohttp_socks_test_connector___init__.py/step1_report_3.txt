{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that provides a proxy connection interface, including error handling, connection helpers, and protocol definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines imports and exports symbols; no data flows, input handling, or processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The version string is standard; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of import statements and an export list (__all__). It serves as an interface or part of a module, with no data processing, network activity, or logic that could indicate malicious intent. It appears to be boilerplate code setting up module exports, typical for Python packages. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as an interface declaration for a proxy-related package module. There are no indicators of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation.",
