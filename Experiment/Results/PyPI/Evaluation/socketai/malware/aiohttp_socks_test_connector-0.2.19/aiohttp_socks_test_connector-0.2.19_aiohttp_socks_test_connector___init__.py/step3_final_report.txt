  "purpose": "Module initialization for a Python proxy library, importing internal components and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ definition; no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard boilerplate with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with imports and exports, containing no dynamic execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer for a proxy library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
