  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements classes (`NoResolver`, `ProxyConnector`) for managing proxy connections in an asynchronous HTTP client (`aiohttp`).\n- Handles proxy URL parsing, socket creation (including custom socket wrappers for non-HTTP proxies), and connection setup.\n- Uses user-supplied parameters for proxy configuration, including credentials.\n- Constructs proxy URLs dynamically, including credentials if provided.\n- Does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears to be standard, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- Proxy credentials are included in URLs but are formatted per standard practices.\n- The data flows are typical for proxy configuration code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads detected.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code relies on user input for proxy credentials and URLs, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is standard for proxy configuration.\n- No evidence of errors or vulnerabilities in the logic.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Comments |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0                | 0.1          | No malware, no obfuscation, very low risk. |\n| 2       | 0               | 0                | 0.2          | Same reasoning, slightly higher risk due to network handling but still negligible. |\n| 3       | 0               | 0                | 0.2          | Similar, standard proxy handling. |\n| 4       | 0               | 0                | 0.2          | Same as above. |\n| 5       | 0               | 0                | 0.2          | Consistent with others. |\n\n**All reports** assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\nThe risk scores are very low, reflecting the standard, legitimate proxy handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- Proxy credentials are handled securely in format, not hardcoded.\n- No signs of backdoors or malicious payloads.\n- The only concern is the handling of user-supplied data, which is typical for proxy configs.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.2** (due to reliance on user input and network operations, but no real vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured implementation for proxy management.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads.\n- The security risk is minimal, mainly related to the inherent risks of user-supplied credentials, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\nThis reflects a safe, standard implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
