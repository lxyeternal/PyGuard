{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data read; all are class definitions for exception handling",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; only exception class declarations",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted input; purely static class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. These classes inherit from standard exception classes and serve as error indicators. There is no code execution, data manipulation, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The structure is straightforward, and the code appears to be part of a larger error handling module. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS and proxy errors with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be a benign component of a larger application or library.",
