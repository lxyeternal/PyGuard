  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definitions do not include executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no data inputs, no untrusted data handling, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution. All classes are straightforward, inheriting from built-in exception types. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase focused on network communication error handling.",
