  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or malicious payloads. The code is static, straightforward, and contains no anomalies.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior or security risks. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores all at 0. This aligns with the analysis, given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. These scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports correctly assign a securityRisk of 0, reflecting this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the static class definitions. They correctly identify that the code snippet is benign and part of a larger error handling framework.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code. There are no discrepancies or unreasonable assessments.\n\n**Overall Evaluation**:  \n- The code is purely a set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security-compromising elements.  \n- The reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent.  \n- The assigned scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, standard, and non-malicious. The reports correctly reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
