  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; these classes are static exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. No input handling, no data processing, and no logic are present. The structure appears straightforward and conventional for defining custom error types. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and standard, with no obfuscated elements or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no malicious indicators or security risks present.",
