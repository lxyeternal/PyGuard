  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data inputs, network activity, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and benign.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is only exception class definitions with no dynamic or network behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n   - The code does not perform any network communication or data manipulation.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this is a benign, standard code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static set of exception class definitions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign and does not pose any security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.",
