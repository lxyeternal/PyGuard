{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external communication points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a series of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types, mainly for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. It appears to be part of a larger system, providing structured exception handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
