  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and OSError, static code with no data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class declarations without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions related to SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception types. It is static, with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code serves as part of an error handling framework and does not perform any data processing or external communication. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, consisting of standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
