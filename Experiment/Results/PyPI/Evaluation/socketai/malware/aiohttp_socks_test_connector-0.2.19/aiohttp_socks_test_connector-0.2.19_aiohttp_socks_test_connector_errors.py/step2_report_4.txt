  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is solely class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), with malware and security risk scores at 0.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and part of error handling.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The actual code matches the descriptions: static class declarations inheriting from standard exceptions.\n- No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Security risk score: 0, since no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports' assigned scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Potential points of critique:**\n- Since all reports agree and are accurate, there's no need to adjust scores.\n- The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores reflect this correctly.",
