  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - All classes inherit from standard exception types (`Exception`, `OSError`).\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The classes are straightforward, static, and serve as error indicators.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger error handling framework for network communication.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is correct given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0, since no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n   - **Confidence Level:** 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that these are benign class definitions.\n   - They do not overstate the security implications, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Recommendations:**\n   - The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the reasoning is sound.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence score (1) is justified.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is purely a set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy scenarios. It is safe, clear, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The reported scores and reasoning are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
