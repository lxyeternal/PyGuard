{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output; no potential sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from base exception classes like Exception, OSError, and SocksError. It sets up a hierarchy of specific error types for SOCKS proxy and connection-related errors. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors present. The classes are simple and standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code. The code is clean, minimal, and appears to serve purely as error handling structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy-related code. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
