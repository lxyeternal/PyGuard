{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for managing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections, handling connection negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials; socket data flows include network communication with proxy servers and DNS resolution.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially be sent via socket communication; especially in _send and connect methods, but no data is maliciously generated or directly leaks information.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hostnames, credentials) are processed through address resolution and authentication routines, then data flows through socket send/receive methods to establish and maintain proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or unusual language features. No data leaks or privacy violations are evident. Exception handling is standard, with no signs of malicious data exfiltration or stealthy behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous socket communication with proxy servers, including proper error handling and address resolution. Usage of libraries and functions appears consistent with typical proxy client implementations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious network activities are present. The logic follows expected patterns for establishing proxy connections. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The overall structure and flow indicate a legitimate proxy client implementation with appropriate security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection classes, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured proxy handling module with proper error handling and no suspicious behaviors.",
