{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, supporting connection negotiation and authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from network responses (e.g., sock_recv calls), configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and local variables during socket negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from network responses (e.g., socket data, error codes) can influence control flow and error handling; potentially malicious responses could trigger incorrect exceptions or behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket responses (e.g., server replies) flows into conditional logic and exception raising; user-controlled inputs (host, port, credentials) influence socket connections and request formation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code performs standard proxy negotiation procedures. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are detected. Error handling appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS proxy client-side socket wrappers, handling network connections, authentication, and address resolution. It uses standard libraries and methods for asynchronous socket communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware patterns. All data flows are typical for proxy negotiation. The code does not include any hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The exception handling appears to be appropriate for connection failures or server errors. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent. It performs typical proxy negotiation and connection procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
