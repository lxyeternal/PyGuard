  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Observation:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 negotiation, error handling, and socket management as expected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the report's conclusion.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, reasonable for a proxy client.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious intent, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Observation:** Similar to Report 1, the code handles standard proxy operations without suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Observation:** Again, the code performs typical proxy negotiation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, aligns with the assessment.\n- **Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Legitimate SOCKS client, no malicious intent, very high confidence (0.95).\n- **Observation:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; the code follows expected patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Proper implementation, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Observation:** The code appears standard, with no embedded backdoors or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** All are zero, matching the detailed reasoning.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), but all are low and justified given the code's nature.\n- **Any suspicious claims?** No, all reports are consistent and cautious, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a typical, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for proxy clients, not risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe and functions as intended for proxy communication.",
