{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers, enabling asynchronous proxy connections with authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames and ports provided for connection, user credentials for authentication, and responses from proxy servers during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be sent over network sockets, including proxy server responses, or data from unresolved addresses. However, no data is being intentionally leaked outside the scope of socket communications.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and credentials flow into address resolution and authentication steps; responses from proxy servers flow into error handling and further connection steps; data transmission occurs via socket send/recv operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual logic; no suspicious network connections or data exfiltration patterns present; all socket operations appear standard for proxy handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard asynchronous proxy connection wrappers with address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. It performs proper error handling, uses standard libraries, and adheres to typical proxy protocols. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The code structure and flow are consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers without malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. All functions follow standard protocols for proxy communication.",
