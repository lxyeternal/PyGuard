{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio, allowing asynchronous proxy connections and negotiations.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user_id; network socket reads and writes; address resolution via getaddrinfo.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions; address resolution; data assembly and transmission to the proxy server.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and address resolution flow into socket connection and negotiation functions, which then send and receive data over network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; code appears to handle data correctly without suspicious obfuscation or hidden code; no signs of data leakage or backdoors. No suspicious network domains or unexpected data flows are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers using asyncio. It manages network connections, address resolution, and SOCKS negotiation protocols. All data handling seems consistent with expected proxy communication patterns. There are no embedded malicious payloads, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no code behaviors indicative of sabotage or malware. The code uses standard libraries and common patterns, with proper exception handling. The only minor concern could be the absence of input validation on host and port, but this is typical and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers without any malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as expected for proxy communication purposes without suspicious code patterns.",
