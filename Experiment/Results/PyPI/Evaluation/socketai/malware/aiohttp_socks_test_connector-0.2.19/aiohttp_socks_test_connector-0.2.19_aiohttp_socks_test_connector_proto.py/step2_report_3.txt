  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to identify any discrepancies, suspicious patterns, or inconsistencies in scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard SOCKS proxy implementation, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code implements SOCKS4/5 negotiation, handles DNS resolution, and uses standard practices. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; the low security risk aligns with the lack of suspicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; security risk is slightly higher but still low.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms standard practices, proper error handling, and no malicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 matches the code's behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy wrapper, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.95), malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and flow are typical, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; security risk remains low.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, with no suspicious code or backdoors detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports agree on the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the detailed analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the typical risks associated with network code, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code appears clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — Slight inherent risk due to network operations, but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients with no malicious or suspicious elements.**",
