{
  "purpose": "This code provides an implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including negotiation and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and connection parameters provided during class instantiation and method calls; DNS resolution via getaddrinfo; socket data received from network.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over sockets during negotiation, authentication, and connection establishment; socket receive methods process incoming server responses, including server error messages and address data.",
  "flows": "Input host/port data is used in address resolution or directly sent in requests; data flows through socket send/receive methods during negotiation, authentication, and connection phases, with server responses processed for success or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; usage of standard socket and asyncio methods appears typical; no suspicious data handling or obfuscated code detected; error handling is standard for network protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy protocol negotiation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 using asyncio for asynchronous socket operations. It handles DNS resolution, authentication, and address requests according to protocol specifications. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or unauthorized system access is observed. Error handling aligns with expected network error patterns. The code appears to be a typical network proxy client implementation with no suspicious or malicious logic. It uses external modules (errors) but does not contain or reference any malicious or obscure code patterns. Overall, the code functions as intended for proxy communication without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It performs typical network proxy negotiation, address resolution, and socket handling, aligned with common practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
