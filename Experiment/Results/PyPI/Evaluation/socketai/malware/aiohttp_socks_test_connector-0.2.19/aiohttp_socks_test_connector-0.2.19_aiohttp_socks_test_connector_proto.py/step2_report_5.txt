  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 implementation with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code is a typical implementation. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score of 0 aligns with the conclusion. The security risk is low, given the standard protocol handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implementation appears legitimate, no malicious intent, standard proxy handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is described as a typical SOCKS proxy client. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 seems slightly higher than report 1, but still low, considering the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis confirms no signs of malicious activity. The code handles network communication appropriately. The risk score remains low and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy wrappers, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with prior assessments. The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy classes, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a typical implementation with no signs of malicious intent. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable, given the network-related functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, matching the observation of clear, standard code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the standard nature of the code and minimal security risk, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's structure and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (standard proxy code, minimal security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent.",
