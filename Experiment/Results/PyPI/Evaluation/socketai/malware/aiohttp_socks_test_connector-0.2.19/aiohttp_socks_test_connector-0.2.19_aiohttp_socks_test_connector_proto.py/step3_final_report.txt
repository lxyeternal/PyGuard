{
  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for network communication, including connection negotiation, authentication, and data transfer.",
  "sources": "Input data includes hostnames/IP addresses, ports, and optional user credentials for authentication during proxy negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows occur during socket communication, data sending/receiving, and DNS resolution, but are handled via standard asyncio socket methods.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (host, port, credentials) flow through address resolution, protocol negotiation, and socket communication to establish proxy connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Error handling and protocol adherence are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols with proper error handling, DNS resolution, and authentication. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code structure is clear, following typical patterns for network proxies. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), consistent with typical proxy client risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk and functions as expected for proxy communication.",
