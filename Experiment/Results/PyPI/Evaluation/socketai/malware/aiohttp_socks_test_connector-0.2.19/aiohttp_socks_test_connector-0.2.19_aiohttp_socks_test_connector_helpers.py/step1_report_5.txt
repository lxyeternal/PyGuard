{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and open network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, with URL parsing and connection setup.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() reads the proxy URL; open_connection() and create_connection() read host, port, and optional proxy URL parameters; socket creation functions read proxy settings.",
  "sinks": "await sock.connect() and loop.create_connection() establish network connections; untrusted data can influence connection parameters.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL input (sources) -> parse_proxy_url() -> create_socket_wrapper() -> connect() -> open_connection() or create_connection() -> loop.create_connection() (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and clear flow reduces suspicion. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code responsibly parses proxy URLs, creates proxy socket wrappers, and establishes network connections via asyncio. No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on external libraries for proxy handling but does not perform any unsafe operations. No hardcoded secrets or unexpected code patterns are present. Functions validate parameters appropriately, and the flow appears standard for proxy connection setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for establishing SOCKS proxy connections with proper parameter handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
