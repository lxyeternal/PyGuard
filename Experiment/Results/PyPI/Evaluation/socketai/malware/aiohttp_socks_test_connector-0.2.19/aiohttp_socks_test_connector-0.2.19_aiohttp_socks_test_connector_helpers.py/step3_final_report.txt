{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish SOCKS proxy connections and parse proxy URLs for use with asyncio-based network operations.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL string input, host and port parameters, optional credentials, and external socket wrapper classes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URL components, credentials, and socket connections used to establish network links.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing → socket wrapper creation → connection initiation via sock.connect or loop.create_connection → data flow through established socket.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing of proxy URLs, handles credentials securely, creates appropriate SOCKS socket wrappers, and establishes connections asynchronously. It validates inputs and raises errors for invalid parameters. No suspicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. External library usage is noted but not inherently malicious. The code structure is clear and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
