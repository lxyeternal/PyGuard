{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections, including parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and establishing connections through proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from 'socks_url', 'host', 'port', 'username', 'password', and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into socket creation, proxy URL parsing, and connection establishment, affecting socket behavior and connection parameters.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing (source) -> socket wrapper creation with credentials and host info (sink) -> connection attempt via socket (sink) -> asyncio connection functions (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. It relies on standard libraries and well-structured functions. No suspicious network connections, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes SOCKS proxy connections based on provided URLs or parameters, parsing URLs for credentials and proxy details. It creates socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 and then establishes connections through them. The functions handle typical network setup tasks securely and do not perform any suspicious actions such as data exfiltration or unauthorized system access. No malware signatures or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of asynchronous connection functions appears standard and intended for legitimate network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware features. The overall security risk score is low.",
