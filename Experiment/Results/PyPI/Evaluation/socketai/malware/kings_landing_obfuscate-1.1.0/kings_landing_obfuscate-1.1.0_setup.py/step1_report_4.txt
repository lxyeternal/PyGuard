  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via os.popen and other shell commands, reads current working directory, hostname, user info, and OS details.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected information via an HTTP POST request to an external Slack webhook URL using os.system with curl, exposing sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "Source: os.popen and os.system commands gathering system info → Sink: curl command sending data to external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code captures detailed system info (hostname, IP, user, OS info) and immediately transmits it to an external service during installation without user consent or obvious necessity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during package setup. It collects extensive system information based on OS detection, including hostname, current directory, user identity, OS details, IP addresses, and public IP. The information is then sent to a Slack webhook URL via a curl command embedded in os.system. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is suspicious in a package installation context. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as modifying files or executing malicious payloads, but the act of collecting and transmitting system data without clear justification is concerning and potentially malicious. The URL used appears to be a Slack webhook, which could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled channel.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect detailed system information and send it externally during package installation, which indicates malicious intent related to data exfiltration. It does not appear to be benign or purely for legitimate setup purposes. Therefore, it poses a significant security risk.",
