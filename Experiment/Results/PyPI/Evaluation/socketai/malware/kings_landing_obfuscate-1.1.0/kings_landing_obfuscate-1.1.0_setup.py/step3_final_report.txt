{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and exfiltrates it via a webhook during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "System commands executed with os.popen() (uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami), and os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to send data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands and os.getcwd()) → data aggregation → sink (curl POST via os.system) to external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during install without user consent, use of hardcoded webhook URL, collection of sensitive info, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system reconnaissance by executing platform-specific commands to gather OS info, hostname, user, IP addresses, and current directory. It then constructs a JSON payload with this data and transmits it via a curl POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, all during the package installation process. This behavior is consistent across platforms and occurs silently, indicating covert data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data theft. The use of os.popen() and os.system() for data collection and transmission is typical but malicious in this context, as it invades user privacy and could be used for reconnaissance or malicious surveillance. The activity qualifies as high-severity malware due to active exfiltration of sensitive data without user consent, constituting a privacy breach and potential supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation. The activity is privacy-invasive, with high potential for abuse. The malware score should be set at 0.9, and the security risk score at 0.9, reflecting the high severity of this supply chain security violation. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, but its activity warrants a high threat level.",
