  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation. The activity is privacy-invasive, with high potential for abuse. The malware score should be set at 0.9, and the security risk score at 0.9, reflecting the high severity of this supply chain security violation. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, but its activity warrants a high threat level."
