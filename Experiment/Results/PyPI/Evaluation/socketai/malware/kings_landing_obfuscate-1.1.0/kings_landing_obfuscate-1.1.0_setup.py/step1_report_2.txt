  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen and os.system: 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist', 'whoami', 'hostname'.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command that POSTs data to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands (sources) is formatted into a JSON string and sent via a network request to the Slack webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during package installation; the code runs system commands and immediately sends sensitive system info to external URL without user consent or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command of setuptools to execute additional actions during package installation. It collects system info such as OS details, IP configuration, hostname, current directory, and user info using system commands. Regardless of the platform, it gathers data and constructs a JSON message. This message is sent via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL, transmitting potentially sensitive system details. The code does not perform any validation, authentication, or user consent before sending data. The purpose appears to be covert data collection, which is characteristic of malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but performs unintended data exfiltration during normal package install process.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information silently during package installation without user awareness or consent. It leverages setuptools' install command hook to execute commands that send sensitive data to an external server. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious package compromise.",
