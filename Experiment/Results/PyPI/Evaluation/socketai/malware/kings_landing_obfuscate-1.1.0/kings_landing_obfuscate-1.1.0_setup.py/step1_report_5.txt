{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to collect system information and send it to an external Slack webhook, possibly for monitoring or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os.popen ('uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig'), current working directory, and executing curl commands to send data.",
  "sinks": "Executing shell commands with os.popen and os.system, particularly the curl command that posts data to a remote Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code collects system information from various sources, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via an HTTP POST request using curl, transmitting host details, user info, and system configuration data to an external endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection during installation, sending system info to a third-party URL without user consent. The webhook URL appears hardcoded and publicly visible, which is suspicious. The code runs system commands dynamically based on platform, potentially exposing sensitive data or being used for reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process to gather system details such as hostname, user, IP configuration, OS info, and current directory. It then constructs a message including this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specific Slack webhook. The data collection occurs every time the package is installed, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' for executing commands and transmitting data indicates an active data exfiltration attempt. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code runs on multiple platforms, increasing its reach. No obfuscation or encryption is evident, and the code does not perform any other suspicious actions like modifying files or establishing reverse shells.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively collects sensitive system information during package installation and sends it to an external webhook without user consent, indicating malicious intent or surveillance behavior. This behavior classifies as malware with a high security risk, especially given the hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration pattern.",
