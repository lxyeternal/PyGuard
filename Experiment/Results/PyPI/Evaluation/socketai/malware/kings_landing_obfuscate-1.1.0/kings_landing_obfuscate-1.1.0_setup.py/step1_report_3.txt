  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process of a Python package to gather system information and send it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system call to send data to Slack webhook.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a curl command that posts system info to a remote Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data retrieved via os.popen and os.system flows from source functions to the webhook URL through the curl command, potentially sending sensitive system info.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of system commands to collect detailed system info on install, sending this info remotely without user consent; use of hardcoded webhook URL; no user prompts or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process by subclassing 'install'. During installation, it executes system commands to gather OS details, current working directory, IP configuration, and user info. It then constructs a payload and sends it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL via a curl command. The collected data can include sensitive information such as hostname, user identity, IP address, and OS details. This behavior is suspicious, as it acts without user awareness or explicit permission, and sends potentially confidential info to an external service. No obfuscation or malicious payload execution is observed beyond data exfiltration, but the activity itself is a privacy violation and potential security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system reconnaissance during package installation and exfiltrates system details to a remote Slack channel, constituting malicious data collection behavior. It does not execute harmful actions like damaging files or reverse shells but poses significant privacy risks and potential for abuse.",
