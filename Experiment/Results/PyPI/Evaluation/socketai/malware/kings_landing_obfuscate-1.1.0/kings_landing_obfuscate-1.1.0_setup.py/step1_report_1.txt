  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen() (uname -a, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, hostname, whoami), and the data read from these commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command that posts collected system information to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (sources) is collected into variables and then formatted into a JSON payload, which is sent via os.system() to the external URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system commands to gather detailed system information, including potentially sensitive data such as hostname, user identity, and network configuration, and then sending this data externally without user consent. The 'public_ip' variable is populated by a command that may reveal the external IP address, which could be used maliciously for fingerprinting or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install process of a Python package to run additional commands on installation. It detects the OS platform and executes relevant system commands to gather system information such as OS details, current working directory, network configurations, hostname, user identity, and public IP address. It then formats these details into a JSON payload and posts it to a Slack webhook URL using os.system(). The data collection appears extensive and designed to exfiltrate system info without user knowledge. The use of subprocess-like calls with os.popen() and os.system() for network communication is potentially malicious, especially since the data is sent externally to a third-party URL, which is suspicious and could constitute data leakage or malicious telemetry.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects detailed system information during package installation and transmits it to an external server via a Slack webhook. This behavior indicates malicious intent, potentially for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The code's purpose is likely malicious or at least privacy-invasive.",
