  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, with references to a suspicious domain. This pattern aligns with malware delivery or backdoor activity. The high scores in the reports are justified given the evidence. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, treat this package as potentially malicious."
