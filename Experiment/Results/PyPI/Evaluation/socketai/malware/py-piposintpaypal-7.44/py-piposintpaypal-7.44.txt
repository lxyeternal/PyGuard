      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The silent execution, obfuscation, and contextual clues strongly suggest malicious activity such as remote code execution or backdoor setup. The package should be treated as malicious until further analysis of the encoded command confirms benign content."
