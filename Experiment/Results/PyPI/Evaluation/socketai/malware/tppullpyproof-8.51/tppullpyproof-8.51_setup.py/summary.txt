  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during setup, combined with suspicious comments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.8) are justified by the evidence. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command are recommended to confirm payload specifics. Overall, this package should be treated as malicious or compromised until further investigation is performed."
