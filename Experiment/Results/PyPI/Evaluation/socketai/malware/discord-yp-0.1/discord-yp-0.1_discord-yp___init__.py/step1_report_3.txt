  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules (not specified in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data output functions, but none are explicitly evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions or processing steps to output or external communication points (not detailed).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious API keys, or obfuscated code observed. No unusual dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code has no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not contain suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard and justified. No anomalies or indicators of obfuscation are present. The code structure and formatting are consistent with typical Python code intended for general purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and suitable for use from a security standpoint.",
