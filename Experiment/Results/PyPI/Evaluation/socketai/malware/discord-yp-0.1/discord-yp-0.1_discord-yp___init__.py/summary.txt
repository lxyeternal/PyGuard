  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the benign reports are accurately scored with no malicious indicators, while the suspicious report's high scores are justified by concrete malicious behaviors such as eval() usage, hardcoded addresses, and unvalidated data flows. The scores are consistent and appropriate given the evidence."
