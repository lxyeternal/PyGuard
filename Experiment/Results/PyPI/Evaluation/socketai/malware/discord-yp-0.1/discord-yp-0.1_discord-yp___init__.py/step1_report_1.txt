  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for data processing or network communication, but the exact purpose is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input (if any), and possibly from network sources or files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, or execution of system commands with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input through processing functions towards sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code structures, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variables are absent.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries, reads data from environment variables or inputs, and performs typical processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are evident. No suspicious network activity, cryptomining, or system damage actions are observed. The structure appears typical of legitimate scripts, with clear flow and no anomalies suggesting sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing or network-related script with no malicious intent detected.",
