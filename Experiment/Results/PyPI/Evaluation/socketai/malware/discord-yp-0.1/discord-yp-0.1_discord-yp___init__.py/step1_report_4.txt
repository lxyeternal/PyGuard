  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic script that imports modules and performs some operations, but without seeing the specific code, its exact function is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; if there are input functions or reading from files, they are not shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writing, or subprocess execution if present; these are not evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows can be identified without detailed code. The flow analysis cannot be completed due to missing code details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observable from the provided snippet. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of actual code, the review cannot identify specific source or sink points, data flows, or anomalies. The structure suggests a standard script, but without detailed content, no malicious indicators can be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, the code appears benign with no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, a comprehensive review requires the actual code content.",
