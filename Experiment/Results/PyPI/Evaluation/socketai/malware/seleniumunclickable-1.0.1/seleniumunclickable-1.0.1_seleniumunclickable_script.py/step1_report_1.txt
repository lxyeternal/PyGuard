{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the system shell.",
  "sources": "The os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external command via os.system, which could run arbitrary code if manipulated.",
  "flows": "The script calls os.system with a fixed command, which could be exploited if the command string is modified or constructed dynamically (not in this code).",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system without input validation is potentially unsafe, but in this case, the command is hardcoded and static. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that executes a system command to run 'my_script.py'. The command is hardcoded and not influenced by external input, reducing the risk of injection. However, invoking system shell commands can be risky if the command string were dynamic. No other suspicious or malicious code elements detected. The script appears to be a simple runner for another script without additional logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code executes a static command to run another Python script. It does not contain malicious behavior or indicators of sabotage. It poses a minimal security risk, mainly if 'my_script.py' itself contains malicious code, but the code here is benign.",
