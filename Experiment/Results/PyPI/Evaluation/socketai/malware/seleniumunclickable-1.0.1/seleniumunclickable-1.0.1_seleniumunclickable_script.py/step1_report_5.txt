{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system shell.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly but invokes a system command via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes 'python my_script.py', which could run arbitrary code if 'my_script.py' is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves calling os.system with a fixed string; any malicious behavior depends on the contents of 'my_script.py'. No additional data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a fixed command is generally safe if the command is static; however, it can be risky if command string is constructed dynamically, which is not the case here. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply runs a predefined script via the system shell. It does not process user input or contain obfuscated code. The security risk depends on the contents of 'my_script.py', but within this code snippet, no malicious behavior is introduced. The use of os.system can be risky if command strings are dynamically generated or if the script being called is malicious or altered.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to execute another script using the system shell. There is no evidence of malicious behavior within this code snippet itself, but it relies on the integrity of 'my_script.py'. No signs of malware or malicious intent are apparent here.",
