{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system's shell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; the primary source is the hardcoded string in os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a shell command which could run any code contained in 'my_script.py'.",
  "flows": "There is a straightforward flow: the script calls os.system with a static string, which executes 'python my_script.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system with a hardcoded command can be risky if 'my_script.py' is manipulated or if user input is introduced elsewhere. No dynamic or untrusted input is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, calling another Python script via os.system. Since the command is static and directly executes a known script, it does not appear to contain malicious behavior within this snippet. However, if 'my_script.py' is malicious or modified, this code could indirectly facilitate malicious activity. The code itself does not perform any suspicious operations, backdoors, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and does not contain malicious intent or obfuscation. Its security risk is low, assuming 'my_script.py' is trustworthy. The main concern is the reliance on external script execution, which could be risky if 'my_script.py' is compromised.",
