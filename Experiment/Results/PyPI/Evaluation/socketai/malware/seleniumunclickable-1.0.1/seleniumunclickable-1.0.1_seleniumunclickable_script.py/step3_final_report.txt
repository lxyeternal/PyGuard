{
  "purpose": "The code executes a static command to run 'my_script.py' via os.system, serving to invoke an external script.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system('python my_script.py') as the primary source of external data execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the external script 'my_script.py' which could potentially perform malicious actions if compromised.",
  "flows": "Static source: the hardcoded command in os.system; sink: the execution of 'my_script.py'. No dynamic data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic command construction.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a main() function that executes a fixed command to run 'my_script.py' via os.system, and calls main() if run directly. It performs a static external script invocation with no user input or dynamic command. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score should be low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk, with primary concern being external script trust. The reports correctly identify the static nature and low inherent risk, with some variation in risk scores justified by external trust assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, executing an external script via a static command. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The code itself does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2).",
