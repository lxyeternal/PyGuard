  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, executing an external script via a static command. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The code itself does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2)."
