{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using a system call.",
  "sources": "The source of input is the hardcoded string 'python my_script.py' used in os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call can execute arbitrary commands, which can lead to command injection if influenced by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows into the os.system call; it uses a static string. However, if the string were constructed from external input, it could be dangerous.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system with a hardcoded command; no dynamic input or environment variables are involved. The script name 'my_script.py' is static, and there are no additional suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main function that calls os.system to run a specific Python script. The script name is hardcoded and static, so there's no indication of malicious behavior such as command injection or data exfiltration. The code structure is simple and straightforward. No suspicious behavior, such as reading untrusted input, executing dynamic commands, or hidden code, is present. The use of os.system is generally discouraged in favor of subprocess for better security, but in this context, it is used with a static string, so risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward execution of a specified script via a system call. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks within this fragment. It appears benign.",
