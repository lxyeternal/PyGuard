{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script 'my_script.py' using the operating system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system call that runs 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of external script via os.system, which could lead to code injection if the command is constructed dynamically with untrusted input (though in this case, it is hardcoded).",
  "flows": "No external input or untrusted data is read; the code directly executes a fixed command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a hardcoded command is straightforward; no obfuscation or unusual code structures present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the os module and defines a main function that executes a fixed command 'python my_script.py' using os.system. Since the command is hardcoded and not influenced by user input, it does not pose a direct risk of code injection. The code is simple and lacks any suspicious or malicious logic. It primarily serves to run another script, which could be benign or malicious depending on 'my_script.py', but within this code fragment, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its only action is to run a specified Python script, with no user input involved. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
