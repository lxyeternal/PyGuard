  "purpose": "Execute an external script 'my_script.py' via a static command using os.system.",
  "sources": "The fixed command string 'python my_script.py' in os.system call.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call which executes the external script.",
  "flows": "Static source (command string) to sink (system execution). No untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic input, no suspicious code patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines main() which calls os.system with a hardcoded command, and runs main() if __name__ == '__main__'. The command is static and does not depend on user input or environment variables. The code itself is straightforward, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py', which is external to this code snippet. The use of os.system is not recommended but does not introduce immediate risk here due to the static command. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting external dependency risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main risk stems from the external script 'my_script.py'. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). Best practices suggest replacing os.system with subprocess for better security control.",
