{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process which downloads and executes external code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a remote URL (constructed dynamically) via requests.get, and reads/writes files on the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded code ('qrcodegen.py') is written to disk and immediately executed via subprocess.check_call, which could run malicious code.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a URL, fetches code from it, saves it locally, and then executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow from remote data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The URL is obfuscated via string concatenation; the downloaded script is executed directly without validation. The URL points to a potentially malicious script given the context. No checksums or integrity verifications are performed. The code runs during installation, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs an external URL dynamically, which could be used to hide malicious intent. During installation ('run' method), it downloads a Python script from this URL, saves it as 'qrcodegen.py', and executes it immediately, bypassing typical security checks. This behavior indicates a supply chain risk, as malicious code could be injected and run on user systems. The rest of the setup is standard, but the dynamic download and execution pose significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation. The obfuscation of the URL and the direct execution of remote content are highly suspicious, indicating a potential supply chain attack vector.",
