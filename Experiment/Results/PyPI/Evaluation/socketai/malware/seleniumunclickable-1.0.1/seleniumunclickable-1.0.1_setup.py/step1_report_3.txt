{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'seleniumunclickable', including a custom install command that downloads and executes an external script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed from concatenated string parts to download 'qrcodegen.py' from a remote server.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call that executes the downloaded script 'qrcodegen.py', which could execute malicious code if the remote script is malicious.",
  "flows": "The requests.get retrieves code from the remote URL -> the content is saved as 'qrcodegen.py' -> subprocess.check_call executes the downloaded script.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL construction through string concatenation, dynamic downloading and execution of code during installation, lack of verification of the downloaded content, and execution of remote code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a URL dynamically from string fragments, likely to hide the true URL. During installation, it downloads a Python script from this URL and immediately executes it without any validation or signature checks. This pattern is typical of malicious package behaviors aiming to run arbitrary code upon installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the core install process is suspicious due to remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation without verification, representing a significant security risk. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
