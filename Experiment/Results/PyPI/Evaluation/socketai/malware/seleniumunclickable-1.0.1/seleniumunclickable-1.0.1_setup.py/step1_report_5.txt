{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and overrides the install command to download and execute an external script during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests library fetching from a remote URL, specifically the 'updater' URL pointing to an external server, and the subprocess call executing the downloaded script.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.check_call executes the downloaded script 'qrcodegen.py', which is fetched from an external source, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The requests.get retrieves code from an external URL, saves it as 'qrcodegen.py', and then subprocess.check_call executes this script, creating a source-to-sink flow that runs remote code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL construction, dynamic fetching and execution of external code during setup, which is highly unusual and suspicious. Use of variable concatenation to hide URL details.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a URL dynamically, then downloads a Python script from that URL during the package installation process. It saves this script locally and executes it immediately. This behavior allows remote code execution at install time, which is a significant security risk. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical indicators of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. There are no other suspicious functions or data leaks evident in the rest of the code. The setup configuration itself appears standard except for the overridden install class.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation. This pattern can be used to deliver malware, backdoors, or perform other malicious activities. The obfuscation and dynamic execution significantly increase the risk.",
