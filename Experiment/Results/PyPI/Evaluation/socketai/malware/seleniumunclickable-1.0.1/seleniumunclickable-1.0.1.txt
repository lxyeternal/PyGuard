      "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, performing remote code download and execution during setup without validation. It employs obfuscation to hide its intent. The behavior poses a severe security threat, indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be assigned as maximum (1.0)."

The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). Best practices suggest replacing os.system with subprocess for better security control."

The code itself does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2)."
