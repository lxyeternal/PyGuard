  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign; the primary security concern is the potential misuse of the 'pip' command name to shadow or interfere with the real pip. Without inspecting 'mypip', no malicious activity can be confirmed. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, with a moderate risk score (~0.3) to account for the naming conflict."
