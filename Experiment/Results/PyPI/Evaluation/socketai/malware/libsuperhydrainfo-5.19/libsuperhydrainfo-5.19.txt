      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The pattern, obfuscation, and context justify high malware and risk scores. All reports correctly identify these indicators. The package should be flagged as malicious, and distribution halted pending further analysis."
