{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'libvmproofcc', intended to install the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment (checking if 'tahg' exists), and from the embedded encoded PowerShell command in subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command, which may lead to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The script checks for 'tahg' directory, then executes a PowerShell command if it doesn't exist; this could be used to run malicious code or payloads retrieved via the encoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated PowerShell command with base64 encoding, which is often used to conceal malicious activities; no clear legitimate reason for executing such a command during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script first imports setup from distutils.core and attempts to run a subprocess with a hidden PowerShell command if 'tahg' does not exist. The base64-encoded command, decoded, executes a PowerShell script from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). The setup block installs a package named 'libvmproofcc' with associated metadata. The code's structure indicates an attempt to silently execute remote code during installation, which is suspicious. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures of malicious actions. Overall, the encoded command and its context suggest malicious intent, possibly for remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, likely malicious. The script attempts to silently run remote code, indicating malicious behavior. The package's setup code is manipulated to include this payload, which is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
