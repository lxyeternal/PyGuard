      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation on Windows. The obfuscation and use of exec() strongly suggest a backdoor or malware component. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or malicious package sabotage. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior."
