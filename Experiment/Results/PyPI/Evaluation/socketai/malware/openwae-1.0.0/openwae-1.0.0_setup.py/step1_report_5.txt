{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior, including decrypting and executing remote code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment (os.name), hardcoded encrypted data within the script (Fernet decryption key and ciphertext).",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network requests to fetch remote code, import and use of potentially unsafe libraries (requests, fernet).",
  "flows": "If on Windows, the script imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code fetched from a remote source via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted at runtime; use of exec() on remote or decrypted code is highly suspicious; the code appears intentionally obfuscated with meaningless variable names and encrypted strings.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package. It includes a custom install class that, on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code from a hardcoded encrypted string. This dynamic execution of remote or encrypted payload during installation is a significant security concern, as it can enable remote code execution and conceal malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted strings further suggest malicious intent or attempt to hide malicious behavior. The package itself appears normal on the surface, but the inclusion of runtime decryption and remote code execution during install is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior through the dynamic decryption and execution of remote code during package installation on Windows, representing a supply chain security risk. It is strongly advised not to use this package.",
