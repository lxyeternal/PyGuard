{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that, during installation on Windows, decrypts an embedded payload using Fernet and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload and decryption key embedded in the code, the OS check for Windows, and the import of requests and Fernet modules.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or backdoor installation.",
  "flows": "OS check (os.name == 'nt') -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt payload with hardcoded key -> execute decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload and hardcoded decryption key, obfuscated class and variable names, conditional execution only on Windows, and execution of decrypted code at install time.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an obfuscated class that, during installation on Windows, imports cryptography modules, decrypts a hardcoded payload, and executes it via exec(). The encrypted payload and key are embedded directly, indicating obfuscation and malicious intent. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution. The pattern suggests a backdoor or malware component designed to run malicious code during package installation, especially targeting Windows systems. The high degree of obfuscation and encrypted payload further support malicious intent. The code does not perform any benign function; its primary purpose appears to be covert execution of potentially harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation on Windows. The obfuscation and use of exec() strongly suggest a backdoor or malware component. The pattern aligns with supply chain attacks or malicious package sabotage. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
