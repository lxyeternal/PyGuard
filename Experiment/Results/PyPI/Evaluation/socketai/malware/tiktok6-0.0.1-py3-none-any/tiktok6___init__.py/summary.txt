  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the lack of code or benign code snippets. No evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior is found. Minor adjustments to confidence and risk scores for reports with missing or limited code would improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable."
