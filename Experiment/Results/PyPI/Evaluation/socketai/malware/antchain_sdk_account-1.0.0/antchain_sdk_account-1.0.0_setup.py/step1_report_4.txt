{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with collected system data during the install process.",
  "flows": "During installation, collected system data (hostname, cwd, username) is sent via a GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of network request in setup.py to send system info without user consent; no safeguards or obfuscation; use of hardcoded URL; the code runs automatically during package install, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and a requests library, then defines a custom install class that extends the standard install command. In the run() method, after executing the original install process, it gathers system information—hostname, current directory, username—and immediately sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL. This behavior occurs during package installation without explicit user permission or disclosure, indicating possible malicious activity such as system fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The URL appears to be a controlled server, potentially used for malicious purposes or command-and-control. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the network activity during setup is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, representing a security threat. It should be considered malicious due to its stealthy data collection mechanism and external communication during setup.",
