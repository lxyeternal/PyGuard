{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external server, likely for malicious tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the system environment: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external URL, acting as the sink where untrusted data leaves the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the source functions (hostname, cwd, username) through the 'ploads' dictionary into the requests.get() call, transmitting to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes performing network requests during package setup without user notification, collecting environment info, and sending it externally—indicative of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, gathers system info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL. This occurs during package installation, which is atypical and suspicious. The modules used are standard, but their combination for covert data exfiltration is malicious. No obfuscation or payloads are present, but the activity itself constitutes malicious behavior. The network request is a clear data leak, and the external URL's suspicious nature indicates potential malicious intent. The activity can be used for device fingerprinting, tracking, or reconnaissance, posing a significant security risk. The code's straightforwardness suggests no obfuscation, but the covert exfiltration activity warrants high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious activity. It poses a high security risk due to privacy invasion and potential malicious tracking. The activity is straightforward but highly suspicious, justifying high malware and risk scores.",
