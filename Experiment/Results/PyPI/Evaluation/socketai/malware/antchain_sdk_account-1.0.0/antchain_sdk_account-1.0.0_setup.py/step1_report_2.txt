{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends collected data (hostname, current working directory, username) to an external server, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script collects system information (source) and immediately sends it over the network to an external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during package installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts. It also collects and transmits system information without user consent or explicit permission.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for package setup and system information. It defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then transmits this data to a specified external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or device fingerprinting. The use of a seemingly random domain ('5r13v9.ceve.io') and the act of sending system details during package installation is suspicious. There are no visible credentials or malicious code execution beyond data collection, but the act of silently sending data without user awareness indicates potential privacy violation and malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server during package installation, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance purposes. It does not appear to be a benign setup script. The likelihood of malicious intent is high.",
