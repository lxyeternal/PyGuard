  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom install command that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests, socket, getpass, and os modules; socket.gethostname(); os.getcwd(); getpass.getuser(); HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with parameters including hostname, current working directory, and username; potential data exfiltration point.",
  "flows": "During installation, retrieve hostname, current directory, username, then send this data to a remote server via HTTP GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without user consent; uses external network request within setup.py, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, when run, collects system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL, passing this data as parameters. This behavior indicates an attempt to collect and transmit user environment details during package installation, which is not typical for a legitimate setup script. The code does not appear to perform any other malicious actions like system modification, file access, or persistence mechanisms. It relies on standard modules and exploits the setup process to exfiltrate data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, which can be used for tracking or malicious data collection. It is suspicious and indicates a security risk, especially if distributed without disclosure.",
