  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'raspberry_getinfo'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed or output; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; all data appears static and predefined within the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The author email appears generic but not malicious; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools. It contains static package metadata and minimal configuration. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no external data fetching. The code appears standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It shows no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is very low.",
