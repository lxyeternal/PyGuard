  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'raspberry_getinfo' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Read package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only specifies setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; the code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies (none in this case), and sets parameters for packaging. All code is static and conventional for Python package setup. No external input handling or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious code, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The package appears benign and follows typical patterns.",
