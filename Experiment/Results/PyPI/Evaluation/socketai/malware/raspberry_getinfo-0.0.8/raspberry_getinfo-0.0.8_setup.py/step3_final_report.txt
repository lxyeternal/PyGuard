  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata (name, version, author, description, classifiers, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or runtime data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration without dynamic or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author name 'stupidfish' and email '2928109164@example.com' are unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup.py script employing setuptools for packaging. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or execution of untrusted inputs. The author details are unconventional but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's nature. The minor risk score of 0.1 in one report appears slightly overstated; a score of 0 is more appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports accurately reflect this, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
