  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'raspberry_getinfo'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata such as name, version, author info, and dependencies specified in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads; no network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a standard setup script with placeholder descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata. No code execution, user input handling, or dynamic behavior is present. Dependencies are commented out, and author info appears generic. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies.",
