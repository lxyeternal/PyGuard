  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, or external files; code execution points such as eval, exec, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file writes, environment variable access, or system commands that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communications), potentially involving dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation patterns, use of eval/exec, encoded strings, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that most reports describe benign scripts with typical data processing or utility functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Report 4 notes potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which warrants cautious scoring. The malware scores are mostly zero, aligning with the absence of confirmed malicious activity. Obfuscation suspicion in Report 4 justifies a moderate score (0.4). Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. The overall assessment supports that the dependency is likely safe, with minor suspicion in specific cases.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign overall. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, with a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 4 justified by obfuscation indicators. No significant malicious activity is detected, and the security posture remains low risk.",
