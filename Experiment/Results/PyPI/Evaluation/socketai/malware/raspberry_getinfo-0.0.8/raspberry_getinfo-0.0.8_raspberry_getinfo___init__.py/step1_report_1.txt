  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package designed to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without analyzing the actual content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files; possibly imports third-party libraries for data handling or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or external services; uses print statements or logging for output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions, potentially leading to outputs or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; however, suspicious patterns include the presence of dynamic code execution, hidden imports, or obfuscated sections, which are not apparent in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed step-by-step. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity were immediately evident. The usage of third-party libraries is typical for data processing tasks. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are apparent. The structure is consistent with standard Python code, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators. Without the actual code content, the evaluation is limited, but based on available information, no malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code review, there are no indications of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose, with no anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
