  "malware_score": 0.85,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to execution of an obfuscated, silent PowerShell command triggered conditionally during package setup. The embedded URL and obfuscation suggest remote payload download or code execution. The assigned scores are justified; overall, this package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious."
