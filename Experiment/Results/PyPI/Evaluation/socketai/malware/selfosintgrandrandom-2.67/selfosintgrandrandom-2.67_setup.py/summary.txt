  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution with silent error handling, indicative of malicious intent. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the embedded payload. Scores of high malware and obfuscation are justified, and the overall security risk is high. Treat this package as potentially malicious until further decoding confirms benign behavior."
