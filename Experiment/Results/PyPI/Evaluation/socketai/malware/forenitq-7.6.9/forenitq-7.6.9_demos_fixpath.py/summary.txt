  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for development convenience, and does not pose security threats. The minor security risk associated with sys.path modification is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some assigning a small risk score (0.1 or 0.2) to reflect potential misuse in untrusted environments. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified."
