  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' module over installed versions for import.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current script location, then constructs and inserts parent directory into sys.path.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification affects module import behavior; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ -> constructs parent directory path -> inserts into sys.path -> subsequent import of 'colorama' uses local version.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward path manipulation without obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the parent directory of the current file and prepends it to sys.path to ensure local module import precedence. It uses standard os.path functions and modifies sys.path in a typical development pattern. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The manipulation of sys.path can pose a risk if the directory contents are compromised, but in controlled environments, this is common practice. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond import handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for development convenience, and does not pose security threats. The minor security risk associated with sys.path modification is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some assigning a small risk score (0.1 or 0.2) to reflect potential misuse in untrusted environments. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified.",
