{
  "purpose": "Adjusts sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' module for import.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), the directory of the script, and the parent directory of the demo directory.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path, which affects module import behavior.",
  "flows": "The code uses __file__ to determine the directory, constructs a path to the parent directory, and inserts it into sys.path, influencing subsequent import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code dynamically manipulates import path but does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code adds the parent directory of the current script's directory to sys.path to ensure local 'colorama' source is used over any installed version. This is a common practice in development or testing environments. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are observed. The code structure and content are straightforward with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign adjustment to module import paths to prioritize local source code. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
