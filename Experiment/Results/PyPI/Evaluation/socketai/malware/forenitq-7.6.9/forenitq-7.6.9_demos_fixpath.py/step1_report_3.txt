  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local source code for the 'colorama' module during import.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory (__file__), and the sys.path list for modifications.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification affects module import behavior, but no direct data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "sys.path is altered to include the parent directory of the current file, influencing import resolution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code adds the parent directory of the current script to the beginning of sys.path to ensure local 'colorama' module is imported over installed versions. This is a common practice in development or testing environments to override installed packages. There is no malicious or suspicious activity, external data flow, or malicious payload. No anomalies such as hidden code, obfuscated strings, or dangerous behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for development convenience. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
