  "purpose": "Demonstrates terminal styling using colorama's context manager and print statements.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static print statements; unused import 'fixpath'.",
  "sinks": "Print statements to stdout; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Static code flow; no data from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'fixpath'; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple terminal styling demonstration. It uses 'colorama_text()' to set terminal styles temporarily and prints static messages. There are no external inputs, network activities, or data leaks. The 'fixpath' import is unused but harmless. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the unused import, which does not pose a threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the unused 'fixpath' import, which does not constitute a security risk. Therefore, malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0, with a very low risk score (e.g., 0.1) reflecting the benign nature.",
