{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to demonstrate and test that ANSI escape sequences for colored output are correctly handled and do not affect redirected standard error streams.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys and importing modules such as colorama, which initializes ANSI handling.",
  "sinks": "Output to sys.stdout via print() and output to sys.stderr via print() with file=sys.stderr.",
  "flows": "Code initializes colorama, then outputs colored text to stdout, and outputs colored text to stderr, ensuring no data leaks or malicious data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward print statements. No suspicious or obfuscated code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to set up ANSI color handling. It prints colored messages to stdout and stderr, then confirms that redirection of stderr does not affect stdout. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injections. The usage is consistent with a testing or demonstration purpose. No hardcoded credentials or unsafe code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple demonstration of ANSI color output handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and appears solely for testing ANSI behavior in output streams.",
