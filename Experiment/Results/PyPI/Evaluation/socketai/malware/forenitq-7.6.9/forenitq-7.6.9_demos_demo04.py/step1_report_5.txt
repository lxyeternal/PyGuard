  "purpose": "The script demonstrates the use of the colorama library to print colored text to stdout and stderr, and tests that redirect stderr does not affect stdout output.",
  "sources": "Reads from the system standard output and standard error streams",
  "sinks": "Outputs colored text to stdout and stderr; no untrusted data inputs are present",
  "flows": "Colorama's init() sets up ANSI handling; print statements send colored strings to stdout and stderr respectively",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and initializes colorama for cross-platform ANSI support. It then prints colored messages to stdout and stderr. The purpose appears to be to verify that redirection of stderr does not interfere with stdout. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or insecure practices. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of color output and redirection handling. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
