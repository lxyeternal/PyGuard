{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama library, standard print statements, and the fixpath module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; standard output used for printing colorized text.",
  "flows": "Colorama initialization settings influence subsequent print outputs, but no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and uses colorama to print colored text with different autoreset settings. The purpose is educational, showing how autoreset affects terminal colors. No input, external data, or sensitive information handling is involved. No malicious functions, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or cryptographic activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple demonstration of colorama's autoreset feature with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code is safe and intended for educational purposes.",
