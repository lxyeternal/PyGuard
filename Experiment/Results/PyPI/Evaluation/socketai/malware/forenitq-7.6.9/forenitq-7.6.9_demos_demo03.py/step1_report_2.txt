  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature with colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath module, colorama initialization, and print statements for colored output.",
  "sinks": "Print statements generate terminal output; no untrusted input handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; colorama functions and print statements are used for formatting only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of colorama is standard for colored terminal output.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the colorama library twice with different autoreset settings and prints colored text to demonstrate behavior. No input handling, no data leaks, and no suspicious or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended as a demonstration of colorama's autoreset feature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
