  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature with different settings.",
  "sources": "import statements, init function calls",
  "sinks": "print function outputs",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama settings -> printing colored text",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of colorama library and no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama and demonstrates the effects of the autoreset parameter. It initializes colorama twice with different autoreset settings, then prints colored text accordingly. The code is straightforward and uses the library as intended without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present. The code's sole purpose is to show color formatting behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely intended for demonstration of colorama's autoreset functionality. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
