  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature with colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Import of colorama module, initialization calls to colorama.init() with different autoreset settings.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output colored text; no untrusted data sources or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama with autoreset=True or False, followed by print statements applying color styles.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and intended for demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, initializes colorama twice with different settings, and prints colored text accordingly. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is simple, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are observed. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
