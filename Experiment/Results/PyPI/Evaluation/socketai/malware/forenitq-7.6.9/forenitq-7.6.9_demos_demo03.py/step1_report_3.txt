  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in colored console output.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, fixpath, and colorama; initialization calls to colorama.init.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only outputs colored text to the console.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama with autoreset=True, printing colored text, re-initialization with autoreset=False, printing more colored text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage is consistent with a demonstration script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets up colored output using colorama with different autoreset settings, and prints sample lines demonstrating the effect. No external data input, no data leakage, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of colorama's features. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
