  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature in terminal coloring",
  "sources": "import statements for fixpath and colorama, initialization calls for colorama",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "N/A; code only initializes modules and prints colored output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard usage of colorama for terminal coloring",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, initializes colorama with different autoreset settings, and prints colored text. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. The use of colorama is typical and straightforward, serving a demonstration purpose. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script solely demonstrates terminal text coloring behavior with no malicious intent or security risks present. It is benign and standard in function.",
