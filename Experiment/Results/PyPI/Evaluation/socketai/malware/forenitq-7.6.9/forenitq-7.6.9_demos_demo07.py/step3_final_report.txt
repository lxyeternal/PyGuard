  "purpose": "Demonstrate terminal cursor movements using colorama library without processing external data or performing malicious actions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with no input handling.",
  "sinks": "Output to terminal; no untrusted data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Code initializes colorama, then outputs cursor movement sequences directly to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'fixpath' but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of terminal cursor control with no external input, network activity, or data leaks. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The import 'fixpath' is unused but benign. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports accurately assess the code's safety. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
