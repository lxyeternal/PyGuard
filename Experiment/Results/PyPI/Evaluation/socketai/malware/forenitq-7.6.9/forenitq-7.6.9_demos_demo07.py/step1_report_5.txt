{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates cursor movement using the colorama library in a terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (print_function), fixpath, and colorama; no external input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements with cursor movement sequences, affecting terminal display but no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; flow involves only cursor movement commands within print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and utilizes colorama for cursor control in terminal output. It does not accept external input, nor does it perform any network operations, file access, or system modifications. The cursor movement sequences are for visual terminal effects only. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of terminal cursor manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
