  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses internal function calls and library functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output to the terminal; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data sources or complex data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses a known library for terminal cursor control. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'fixpath' (though unused) and 'colorama', then defines cursor movement variables using colorama's cursor functions. The main() function initializes colorama and prints several lines, manipulating cursor position with relative movements (up, down, forward, back). The print statements produce terminal output demonstrating cursor movements, with an expected visual output. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a harmless demonstration of terminal cursor control via colorama. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It neither processes untrusted input nor performs insecure operations.",
