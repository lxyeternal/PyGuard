{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python, primarily for output formatting in the terminal.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only executes internal function calls and prints output.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to standard output (console) using print statements with cursor movement sequences, but no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; cursor movement commands are constructed internally and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code solely manipulates terminal cursor positions for formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, initializes colorama for cross-platform terminal control, and performs cursor movement operations via colorama.Cursor. The main function constructs a sequence of cursor movements and prints output accordingly, aiming for a visual pattern in the terminal. No external data is read, and no potentially malicious functions or behaviors are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and only affects terminal output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor manipulation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
