  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'forenitq' Python project, including version retrieval and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files: '__init__.py' for version, 'README.rst' for description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted input or data that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Reading file content -> Extracting version string -> Using metadata for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of 'with' statement is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files, extracting version info via regex, and configuring package metadata. No input validation issues or data leaks are present. The use of 'try-except' for importing 'setuptools' is conventional. No suspicious network activity or malicious code patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles package metadata and version extraction in a standard manner.",
