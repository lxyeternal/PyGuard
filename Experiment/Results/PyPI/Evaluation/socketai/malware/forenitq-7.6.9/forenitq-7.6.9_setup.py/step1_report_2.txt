{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'forenitq' Python project, mainly defining package metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '__init__.py', reads 'README.rst' for long description, reads files from filesystem for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no output or external data handling beyond filesystem read operations.",
  "flows": "Reads files from disk, extracts version info, and passes data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard package setup tasks with proper version extraction via regex. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup procedures for a Python package, including reading files and extracting version info via regex. It uses standard libraries and no dynamic code execution or external inputs that could pose security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely reads package metadata and prepares the package for distribution. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior detected.",
