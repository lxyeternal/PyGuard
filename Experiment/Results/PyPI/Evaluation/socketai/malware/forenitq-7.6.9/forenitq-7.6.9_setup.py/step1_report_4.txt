  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'forenitq'. It reads package information and prepares it for distribution.",
  "sources": "File system reads for 'README.rst' and '__init__.py' to extract version info",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "File reading flows from 'read_file' to version extraction and setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations: reading files, extracting version strings using regex, and calling setup() with package metadata. It uses safe practices for file I/O and regex matching. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. No external network connections, cryptic code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It purely handles package metadata and distribution setup.",
