  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard setup script with safe file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging. It reads version info from a source file, and the rest are static configuration parameters. No input validation vulnerabilities or malicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is involved. The code structure and imports are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malware. It appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
