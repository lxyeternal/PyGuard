  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data handling, external commands, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The version extraction via regex from `__init__.py` is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for such scripts.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is solely to prepare package metadata for distribution.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports' scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all 0 or 0.5, which aligns with their conclusions.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not execute any untrusted input or external commands.\n- The regex for version extraction is standard and safe.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only minor note is the use of `with_statement` import, which is relevant for Python 2.7 and earlier, but not suspicious.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and align well with the code's nature. No further action or concern is necessary.",
