{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package distribution, configuring metadata and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Reading the package's __init__.py file to extract version, reading README.rst for long description, reading setup script parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script does not execute untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Read file content -> extract version -> use in setup configuration; no external data flows or untrusted inputs affecting the code's behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. Usage of regex for version extraction is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static file reads and package configuration using standard setup tools. It includes a version extraction function that parses the package's __init__.py file with a regex. No user input, network operations, or untrusted data handling is involved. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks identified. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
