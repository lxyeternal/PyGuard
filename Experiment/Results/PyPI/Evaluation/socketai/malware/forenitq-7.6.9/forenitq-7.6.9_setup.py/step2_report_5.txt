  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It reads metadata files, extracts version info via regex, and calls `setup()`.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- The code is benign, performing typical setup tasks.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The logic and reasoning in all reports are sound and align with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly assigned as 0. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly assigned as 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Correctly assigned as 0. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are identified.\n\n### Any discrepancies or issues?\n- All reports agree, and their reasoning is accurate.\n- The use of regex for version extraction is standard practice.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or external data handling are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe Python setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports correctly identify this, and I concur with their assessments.",
