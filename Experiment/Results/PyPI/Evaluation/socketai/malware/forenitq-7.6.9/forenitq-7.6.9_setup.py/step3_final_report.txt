  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging, reading metadata files, extracting version info via regex, and configuring package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads files from disk (e.g., __init__.py, README.rst), uses regex to extract version string.",
  "sinks": "None; only filesystem reads, no external data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "File reading to variable assignment; regex matching to extract version; data passed to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script. It performs static file reads, regex-based version extraction, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The regex for version extraction is a common pattern. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. All signals indicate benign, well-understood behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
