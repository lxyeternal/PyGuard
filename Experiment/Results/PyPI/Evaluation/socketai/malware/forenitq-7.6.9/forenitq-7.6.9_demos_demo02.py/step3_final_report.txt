  "purpose": "Demonstrate terminal styling using the colorama library with various foreground, background, and style attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input; static print statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static demonstration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'fixpath', but it does not impact security or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static demonstration of terminal styling. It imports 'fixpath' which is unused, but this is benign. No user input, external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code only prints styled text using colorama. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
