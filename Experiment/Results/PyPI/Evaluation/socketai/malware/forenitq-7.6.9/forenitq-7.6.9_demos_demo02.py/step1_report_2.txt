{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing text foreground, background, and brightness styles using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "Imports from colorama and fixpath; no external or user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; only print statements with static strings and style constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static style formatting is applied directly in print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed; 'fixpath' import is not further detailed but appears to be a local or benign module.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the colorama library and performs styled print operations using constants from colorama. No user input, environment variable manipulation, or external data is processed. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of demonstrating text styling. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple demonstration of text styling with colorama. It contains no malicious or security-related issues. The code is benign and primarily for visual output purposes.",
