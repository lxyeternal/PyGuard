  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing foreground, background, and style using the colorama library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically reading from __future__ and external libraries (fixpath, colorama).",
  "sinks": "Printing to the console using print() functions with styled text.",
  "flows": "Sources (imports) lead to styled print statements which output formatted text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and initializes colorama. It then prints styled text with different foreground, background, and style attributes. All operations are limited to styled terminal output without user input, data exfiltration, or external network connections. The code appears to serve as a simple demo, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of text styling using colorama. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
