The minor security risk associated with sys.path modification is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some assigning a small risk score (0.1 or 0.2) to reflect potential misuse in untrusted environments. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are justified."

The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be set to 0 for accuracy. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores reflecting no threat."
