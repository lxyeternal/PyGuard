{
  "purpose": "The script displays a grid of all foreground and background color combinations with various brightness styles using the colorama library, primarily for visual demonstration or testing of terminal color support.",
  "sources": "Data sources are limited to standard input/output streams (sys.stdout) and the imported colorama library; no external or untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "Output to sys.stdout, where data is displayed on the terminal; no untrusted data is written elsewhere or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "The code constructs color and style sequences using predefined constants and writes them directly to stdout, displaying a color grid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard library and a third-party library (colorama) for terminal styling, which is common for such display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports and initializes colorama, then creates arrays of ANSI color/style codes, and maps them to names. It then outputs a formatted grid showing color combinations. All code functions are for terminal output formatting. No user input, external data, or malicious code execution is present. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code is straightforward and appears solely for visual demonstration of terminal colors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for displaying terminal color grids. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
