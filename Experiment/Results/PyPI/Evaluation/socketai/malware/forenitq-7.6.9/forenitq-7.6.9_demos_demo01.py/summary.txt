  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving solely as a terminal color grid display. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be set to 0 for accuracy. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores reflecting no threat."
