  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's initialization with wrapping enabled and disabled for ANSI escape sequences on different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads input/output streams (sys.stdout), imports modules",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings to stdout and files, uses AnsiToWin32 to write ANSI sequences directly to output",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama -> print statements with ANSI escape codes -> output to stdout/file using AnsiToWin32",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard usage of colorama for terminal text formatting. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code paths, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports colorama and uses its functions to print colored text with different initialization parameters. It demonstrates how ANSI escape sequences are handled with wrapping enabled or disabled. The code involves standard library functions and third-party colorama usage without any signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of colorama's functionality, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely within terminal formatting and does not perform any malicious actions.",
