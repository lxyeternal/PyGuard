{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the difference between Colorama's ANSI wrapping on and off on Windows and Unix systems.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, input (indirectly via print), environment variables (potentially via colorama init), module imports",
  "sinks": "Console output streams, specifically sys.stdout, and possibly the file parameter of print",
  "flows": "Colorama's init() influences how ANSI escape sequences are handled, affecting print output to sys.stdout and file outputs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of colorama appears standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colorama, initializes it with default and unwrapped modes, and prints colored text to stdout. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of a library's functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign demonstration of colorama's ANSI handling features. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack indicators, or security risks are detected.",
