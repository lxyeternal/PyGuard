  "anomalies": [
    "heavy obfuscation with multiple layers of base64 and decode, making static analysis difficult",
    "use of eval to execute decoded payloads",
    "decoded payloads are dynamically constructed from encoded strings",
    "imported modules are used solely for decoding and dynamic code execution, which is suspicious",
    "multiple functions like eval, decode, and base64 decoding are used in complex, layered ways"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is heavily obfuscated with multiple layers of encoding and decoding, involving base64 strings and decode functions. The use of eval to execute the decoded payloads indicates a high risk of malicious activity, such as running arbitrary or harmful code on the host system. The code reads encoded data, decodes it multiple times, and then executes it dynamically, which is typical of malware designed to evade static detection. The structure indicates deliberate concealment of the true payload and purpose, strongly suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated with multiple layers of decoding and executes dynamically decoded code via eval, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. It likely functions as a loader for malicious payloads, designed to evade detection by obscuring its true intent. Due to the layered decoding, the actual payload cannot be determined statically, but the pattern of execution and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious activity.",
