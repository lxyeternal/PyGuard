  "anomalies": "Obfuscated strings, multiple layers of decoding, base64 decoding, eval calls with decoded data, dynamic code execution, absence of explicit function definitions or clear purpose, use of eval and exec-like functions on decoded data. The code uses unusual string manipulations and multiple encrypted/encoded layers to hide its true intent, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with obfuscated eval and string manipulations, suggesting an attempt to hide true intent. It decodes base64-encoded data, decrypts or decodes further payloads, and then dynamically executes the resulting code. The multiple layers of decoding and obfuscation indicate an attempt to conceal malicious payloads. The code's purpose seems to be to load and execute hidden code, likely malicious, from encoded strings, with no clear benign functionality. The use of eval and base64 decoding on dynamically decoded strings strongly signals malicious intent, potentially to deliver backdoors, data exfiltration, or further payload execution.",
  "conclusion": "This script is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation, layered decoding, and execution of dynamically decoded code. These are classic signs of malicious payload delivery or backdoor setup. The code likely intends to conceal its true purpose, which appears to be malicious, such as executing hidden payloads or establishing unauthorized system access.",
