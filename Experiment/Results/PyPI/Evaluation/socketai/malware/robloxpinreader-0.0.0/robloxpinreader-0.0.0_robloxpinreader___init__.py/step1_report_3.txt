{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python script likely designed to execute hidden or malicious code after decoding and deobfuscation steps.",
  "sources": "Data is read through multiple decode, base64 decode, and eval eval functions, often with hardcoded obfuscated strings and base64-encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decoded code via eval, dynamic function calls, and decoded strings that may contain malicious payloads, including network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated strings are decoded (base64, eval, decode), then passed through a series of decode and eval steps, potentially leading to execution of hidden malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation using eval, base64, decode, and dynamic code execution methods. Presence of hardcoded strings, base64 data, and eval calls that execute decoded data. Multiple layers of obfuscation to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with eval, base64 decoding, and string decoding, making it difficult to determine its exact purpose without execution. The pattern suggests it is designed to hide malicious payloads or commands, possibly download or execute further malicious code, or perform unauthorized system actions. The presence of functions like eval on decoded strings, along with multiple decoding layers, indicates an attempt to conceal its true behavior. The code's structure suggests it may fetch, decode, and execute malicious payloads dynamically, making it highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a highly obfuscated malicious payload that decodes and executes hidden code, likely for malicious purposes such as remote command execution, data exfiltration, or further malware download. Its obfuscation, use of eval, and multiple decoding layers strongly suggest malicious intent.",
