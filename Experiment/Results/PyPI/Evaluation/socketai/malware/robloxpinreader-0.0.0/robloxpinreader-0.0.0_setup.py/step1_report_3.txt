  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'robloxpinreader' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements and setup() function call, including the 'install_requires' dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package metadata, with no direct data output or external communication in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from source to sink within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and calling setup() with package details and dependencies. No user input, data reading, or untrusted data sources are present. The dependencies listed ('browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', 'requests') are common in Python projects, though some may be used for automation or data retrieval. There are no malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection within this snippet. The comments and structure appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
