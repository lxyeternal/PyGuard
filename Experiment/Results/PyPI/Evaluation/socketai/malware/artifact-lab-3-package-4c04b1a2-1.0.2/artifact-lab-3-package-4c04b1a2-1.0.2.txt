The activity is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is malicious. The scores are consistent with the activity observed."

The behavior is explicit, with no obfuscation, and the external URL suggests malicious control. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1. The code should be flagged as malicious and removed from repositories; users should be warned against installing such packages."
