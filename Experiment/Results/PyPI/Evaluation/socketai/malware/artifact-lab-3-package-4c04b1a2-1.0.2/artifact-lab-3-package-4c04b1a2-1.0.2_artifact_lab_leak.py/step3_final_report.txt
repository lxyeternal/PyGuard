{
  "purpose": "The code collects all environment variables and transmits them via an HTTP POST request to an external Ngrok URL, likely for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data to external URL)",
  "flows": "os.environ -> urllib.parse.urlencode -> urllib.request.Request -> urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Ngrok URL without validation or user consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation; data exfiltration activity.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly gathers environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a specified external URL without validation or safeguards. The use of a transient Ngrok URL suggests covert data exfiltration. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and performs a suspicious activity that could be malicious if used without authorization. The behavior aligns with malicious data theft, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads like reverse shells or destructive commands. The high scores for malware and security risk are justified by the activity, though the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert exfiltration of environment variables to an external server, indicating malicious intent. The activity is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is malicious. The scores are consistent with the activity observed.",
