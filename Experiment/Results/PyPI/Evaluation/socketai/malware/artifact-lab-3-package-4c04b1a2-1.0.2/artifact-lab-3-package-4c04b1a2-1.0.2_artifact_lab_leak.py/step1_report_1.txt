  "purpose": "Collects environment variables and sends them to a specified external URL.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via urllib.request.urlopen() to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected and then sent directly to the external URL without validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code leaks environment variables, which can contain sensitive information. Use of a hardcoded external URL (Ngrok) indicates potential data exfiltration. No validation or restriction on data transfer.",
  "analysis": "The script collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a remote server specified by a hardcoded Ngrok URL. The purpose appears to be to exfiltrate environment data, which could include sensitive credentials or tokens. There is no input validation or access control, and the hardcoded URL suggests an intent to covertly transmit data. This behavior is consistent with malicious data theft or spying activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server, which can be malicious if used without consent. It does not perform any benign function and appears intended for covert data leakage.",
