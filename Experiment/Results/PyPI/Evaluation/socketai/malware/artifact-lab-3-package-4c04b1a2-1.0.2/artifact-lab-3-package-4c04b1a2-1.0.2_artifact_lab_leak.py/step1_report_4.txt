  "purpose": "Collects environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables using os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected environment data to an external server through urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are gathered, URL-encoded, and transmitted to the specified URL via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly leaks environment variables to an external server, which is a security concern. The URL used is a local Ngrok endpoint, suggesting a potential testing or malicious activity setup. No authentication or encryption is implemented for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code reads all environment variables and transmits them to an external endpoint. This behavior can be malicious if used without user consent, as it leaks potentially sensitive information. The use of a hardcoded URL (Ngrok) indicates potential malicious intent or testing for malicious data exfiltration. No input validation or user confirmation is present. The code could be part of a data exfiltration scheme or a backdoor component designed to harvest environment data.",
  "conclusion": "The script leaks environment variables to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent. Its behavior resembles data exfiltration typical of malware, especially given the hardcoded external URL and lack of safeguards.",
