  "purpose": "Collects environment variables and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network using urllib.request.urlopen with data encoded from environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent over network to a remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Uses an external URL (Ngrok endpoint) to transmit environment data, which could be malicious if used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects all environment variables, encodes them, and transmits them to a remote server specified by an Ngrok URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, especially if the code is executed without user knowledge or consent. The URL appears to be a dynamically generated Ngrok endpoint, commonly used for tunneling or temporary access, which is suspicious. There are no obfuscations or complex code constructs; however, the purpose of leaking environment variables to an external entity is inherently malicious. The code could be used to harvest sensitive environment data, such as credentials or tokens, and send it to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a potentially malicious activity by exfiltrating environment variables to a remote server without user consent. While it may be part of a penetration testing tool or legitimate debugging, in general use, this behavior indicates malicious intent and data leakage.",
