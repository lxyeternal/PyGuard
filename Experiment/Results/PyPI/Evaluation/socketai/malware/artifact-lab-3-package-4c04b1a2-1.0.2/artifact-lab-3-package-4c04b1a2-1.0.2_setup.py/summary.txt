  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious environment variable exfiltration during package installation, indicating a high-severity supply chain attack. The behavior is explicit, with no obfuscation, and the external URL suggests malicious control. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1. The code should be flagged as malicious and removed from repositories; users should be warned against installing such packages."
