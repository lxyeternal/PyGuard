{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect environment variables and send them to an external URL upon package installation, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read using os.environ in run_payload() function.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via urllib.request.urlopen to an external Ngrok URL, acting as the sink.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected in run_payload() and directly sent to the specified URL during the custom installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The payload is embedded within the setup script, which is unusual; the URL uses a tunneling service (Ngrok), often associated with temporary or malicious hosting. The code runs automatically on install without user consent. No other legitimate purpose is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and overrides the install command to execute run_payload() during installation. run_payload() collects all environment variables and sends them via POST request to an external URL, indicating potential data exfiltration. The URL is hardcoded and points to a tunneling service, which is suspicious. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks beyond this malicious activity. There are no obfuscated elements, but embedding such behavior in a setup script is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. No other malicious activities or backdoors are present; the primary concern is data leakage via environment variable transmission during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate environment variables during installation, representing a significant security risk. The code's purpose appears to be privacy invasion rather than legitimate package setup.",
