  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious PowerShell payloads executed conditionally during setup, with high obfuscation and risk scores justified by the suspicious, hidden execution and external URL. All reports accurately identify these issues. The package should be flagged for further review or removal due to high malicious potential."
