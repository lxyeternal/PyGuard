      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated remote command during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The pattern suggests a supply chain attack vector, and the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious. The use of localhost URL may be a placeholder, but the obfuscation and execution pattern are indicative of malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code in the package shows high likelihood of malicious behavior in certain components (reports 2 and 5), justified by obfuscation, eval/exec, and network activity. Benign components are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the package contains both benign and malicious elements, with the malicious parts warranting caution."
