  "conclusion": "The code in the package shows high likelihood of malicious behavior in certain components (reports 2 and 5), justified by obfuscation, eval/exec, and network activity. Benign components are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the package contains both benign and malicious elements, with the malicious parts warranting caution."
