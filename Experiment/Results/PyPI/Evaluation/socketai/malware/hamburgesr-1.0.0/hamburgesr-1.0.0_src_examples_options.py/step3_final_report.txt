  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, eval/exec calls, hardcoded credentials, input data.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, system calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, dynamic imports.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with suspicious network activity and hardcoded credentials indicating malicious intent. Benign code lacks such patterns. The suspicious behaviors are consistent with high malware and obfuscation scores, and the benign code aligns with low scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the package shows high likelihood of malicious behavior in certain components (reports 2 and 5), justified by obfuscation, eval/exec, and network activity. Benign components are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the package contains both benign and malicious elements, with the malicious parts warranting caution.",
