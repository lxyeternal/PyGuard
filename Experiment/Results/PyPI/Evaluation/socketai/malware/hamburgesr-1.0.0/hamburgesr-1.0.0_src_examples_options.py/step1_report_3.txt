{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions. Its exact purpose cannot be definitively determined due to lack of explicit comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, hardcoded strings, and possibly input functions if present. The code also imports external libraries which could serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or database interactions if present. However, no direct network or system calls are explicitly observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through various functions and possibly to sinks like file writes or network calls if used.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. There are no signs of malicious backdoors or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from environment variables and possibly user inputs, processes this data through standard functions, and outputs or stores results. No network connections, code injections, or system modifications are detected. The code structure is straightforward without complex or misleading constructs. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The absence of suspicious patterns suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to perform standard data processing functions with no evident supply chain threats. Confidence in this assessment is high, and the code is not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
