  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated remote command during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The pattern suggests a supply chain attack vector, and the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious. The use of localhost URL may be a placeholder, but the obfuscation and execution pattern are indicative of malicious intent."
