{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that includes malicious behavior by executing a decoded base64-encoded URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc(), which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded URL command, potentially leading to remote connection or download.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes the base64 string; notmalfunc() calls os.system() with the decoded URL, executed during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate URL execution; code executes external URL during install phase; no input validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions and classes. The key malicious activity is in notmalfunc(), which decodes a base64 string that translates to a URL and executes it via os.system. This occurs during the install process, triggered by the AfterInstall class's run() method. The URL appears to be a remote host, which could be used to download malicious payloads or establish backdoors. The code uses obfuscation techniques like base64 encoding to hide the URL. Overall, the script is designed to execute remote code during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing a remote URL during package installation to potentially download or execute malicious content. The obfuscation and execution at install time are typical indicators of supply chain malicious behavior.",
