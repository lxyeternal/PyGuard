      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-confidence indicator of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command during package setup. The suspicious obfuscation, hidden execution, and silent error handling justify high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. This package should be considered malicious or compromised until further analysis of the encoded payload confirms its intent."
