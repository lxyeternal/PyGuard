  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests (via 'requests'), dynamic strings, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variable access, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs to network endpoints or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic strings, slight obfuscation in report 2, lack of comments or documentation, potential data collection activities.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical data handling with environment variables and network requests. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. Slight obfuscation is present in report 2, but no definitive malicious payloads are identified. The network activity and environment variable access are common but can be exploited for data exfiltration. The overall behavior appears benign across reports, with scores reflecting moderate suspicion in report 2 and minimal or no suspicion elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, there is no confirmed malicious code or payloads. The suspicion levels are moderate in report 2 due to network and environment variable usage, but no concrete malicious activity is evident. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware set to 0, obfuscation around 0.2 for report 2, and low security risks (~0.2-0.3). Overall, the code appears benign, and the security posture is acceptable.",
