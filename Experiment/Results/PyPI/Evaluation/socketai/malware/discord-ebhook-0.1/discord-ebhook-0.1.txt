      "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated with complex calculations and system interactions that are typical of malicious supply chain sabotage or backdoor payloads. Its intent appears to be covert system modification, privilege escalation, or malicious package installation, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code features, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Adjusting malware score for Report 2 from 0.3 to 0.4 can better reflect the suspicion level. Other reports are consistent with their benign summaries."
