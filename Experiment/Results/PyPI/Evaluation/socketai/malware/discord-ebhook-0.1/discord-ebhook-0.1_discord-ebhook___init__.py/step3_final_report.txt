  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), network or file operations, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into processing functions, potentially leading to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (high variable complexity, eval/exec usage), dynamic code execution, unusual control flow, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates benign code with no suspicious features; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, with high confidence. Report 2 shows obfuscation and dynamic features, with scores of 0.7 (obfuscated) and 0.3 (malware), justified by signs of concealment but no confirmed malicious activity. Slightly increasing malware score to 0.4 could better reflect suspicion, but 0.3 remains acceptable. Report 3 lacks code, scores zero. Report 4 is straightforward and benign, scores low. Report 5 is also benign, with no suspicious features. Overall, only Report 2 warrants a higher malware score; others are consistent with benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code features, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. Adjusting malware score for Report 2 from 0.3 to 0.4 can better reflect the suspicion level. Other reports are consistent with their benign summaries.",
