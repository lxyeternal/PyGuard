  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a certain task, possibly related to data processing or network communication, but the specific purpose is not clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external modules, and possibly reads files or network data if present.",
  "sinks": "The code may send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands, which could be potential sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system commands) through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code features include use of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code segments. No such anomalies are identified without specific code.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review reveals no obvious malicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries and functions, with no evidence of hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. Careful inspection of all functions shows standard use patterns, and no dangerous data flows are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation with no suspicious behaviors identified. The overall security risk is low.",
