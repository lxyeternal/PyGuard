  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state, embedded with a suspicious URL. The obfuscation, silent execution, and red flags justify high malware (~0.85), obfuscation (~0.9), and security risk (~0.9) scores. The code should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms benign content."
