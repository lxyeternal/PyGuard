      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to runtime decryption and execution of encrypted payloads during installation, indicating a likely malicious package designed for malware delivery or backdoor access. The obfuscation and conditional Windows-only execution further support this assessment. The scores should reflect high malware (approaching 1), high obfuscation, and high security risk."
