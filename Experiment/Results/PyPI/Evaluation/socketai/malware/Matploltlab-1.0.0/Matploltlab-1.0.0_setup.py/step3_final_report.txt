{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and execute a potentially malicious payload during installation on Windows systems by decrypting and executing encrypted code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload within the install class; no external input is used.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts the payload using Fernet, then executes it directly with exec(), during the install process on Windows, creating a source-to-sink flow of decrypted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encryption keys, encrypted payloads, use of exec() on decrypted data, conditional execution only on Windows, and nonsensical description strings indicate obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a package named 'Matploltlab' with a custom install command that, on Windows, decrypts and executes code at install time. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() suggests obfuscation and malicious behavior. The code's structure, including hardcoded cryptographic keys and conditional execution, aligns with common malware tactics such as backdoors or payload delivery. The setup_requires includes 'fernet', which is not a standalone package, indicating potential setup issues but not necessarily malicious. The overall pattern indicates high suspicion of malicious intent, with encrypted payload execution being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to runtime decryption and execution of encrypted payloads during installation, indicating a likely malicious package designed for malware delivery or backdoor access. The obfuscation and conditional Windows-only execution further support this assessment. The scores should reflect high malware (approaching 1), high obfuscation, and high security risk.",
