  "malware_score": 0.95,
  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to runtime decryption and execution of encrypted payloads during installation, indicating a likely malicious package designed for malware delivery or backdoor access. The obfuscation and conditional Windows-only execution further support this assessment. The scores should reflect high malware (approaching 1), high obfuscation, and high security risk."
