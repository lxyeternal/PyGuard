      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup. The silent error handling and hidden process execution further support malicious intent. The package should be treated as potentially compromised, and the encoded command should be decoded and analyzed for definitive malicious payloads."
