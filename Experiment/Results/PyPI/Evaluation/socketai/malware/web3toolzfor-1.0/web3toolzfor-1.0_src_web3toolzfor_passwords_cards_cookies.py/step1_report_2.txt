{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as passwords, cookies, browsing history, credit card data, and downloads from various browsers and send this data to a remote server, effectively acting as a credential and data stealer.",
  "sources": "Reads browser data files from user directories, Local State files for master keys, database files for logins, cookies, history, downloads, and credit cards, and environment variables for user directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends the collected data via HTTP POST request to a hardcoded URL, and writes sensitive data into temporary files on the local machine.",
  "flows": "Data is extracted from browser files (sources), decrypted or read, stored temporarily in local files, aggregated, archived, and then uploaded to the remote server endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The script decodes a suspicious URL and uses it as a webhook, extracts sensitive user data without any user consent, and stores/deletes files in temp directories. It also automates the collection of passwords, cookies, history, and credit cards, indicating malicious intent. Usage of functions like CryptUnprotectData and AES decryption, combined with hardcoded target URL, suggests stealthy data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script targets multiple browsers to extract stored credentials, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card info by accessing browser profile data directories. It decrypts encrypted data using Windows API functions and cryptography libraries, then saves this data into files within a temp directory. Finally, it archives all data into a ZIP file and uploads it via a POST request to a remote URL decoded from base64, indicating an intention to exfiltrate sensitive user information covertly. The code operates silently, with no user interaction or consent, and employs common stealer techniques such as temporary file handling, data encryption, and network transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, functioning as a credential and data stealer targeting browser stored data. It exfiltrates sensitive information to a remote server without user consent, posing significant security and privacy risks.",
