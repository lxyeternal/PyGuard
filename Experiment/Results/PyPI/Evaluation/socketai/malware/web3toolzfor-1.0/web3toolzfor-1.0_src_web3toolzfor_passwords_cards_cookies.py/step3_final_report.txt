{
  "purpose": "The code extracts sensitive user data from various browsers, decrypts it, stores it locally, archives it, and exfiltrates it to a remote server, indicating malicious intent to steal credentials, cookies, history, credit card info, and downloads.",
  "sources": "Browser database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, Downloads), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA), Local State files, user profile directories.",
  "sinks": "Remote server via HTTP POST request with the archived data, local temporary files and directories used for processing.",
  "flows": "Reads database files -> copies to temp -> decrypts data using Windows API and cryptography libraries -> compiles data into text files -> archives files -> uploads archive to remote URL decoded from base64.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for the remote URL (obfuscation), silent operation without user notification, extensive access to browser data, temporary file handling with cleanup, no user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs comprehensive extraction of browser-stored credentials, cookies, history, and credit card data, decrypts encrypted information using Windows cryptography APIs, and exfiltrates the data silently. It employs mild obfuscation via base64 encoding of the remote URL, indicating intent to hide the exfiltration endpoint. The code operates automatically, with no user interaction, and cleans up temporary files after processing. All these behaviors align with malicious data theft and exfiltration activities. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests no advanced anti-analysis or anti-forensic techniques. The code's purpose is clearly malicious, targeting user privacy and system security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer targeting multiple browsers. It employs mild obfuscation and operates silently, exfiltrating sensitive data to a remote server. The behavior justifies maximum malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation level is moderate, primarily the base64-encoded URL. Overall, it constitutes a high-severity threat requiring immediate attention.",
