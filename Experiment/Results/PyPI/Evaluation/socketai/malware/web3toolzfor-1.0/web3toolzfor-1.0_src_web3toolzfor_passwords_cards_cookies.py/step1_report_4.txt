{
  "purpose": "The script collects and exfiltrates sensitive user data such as passwords, cookies, browsing history, downloads, and credit card information from various browsers and uploads the collected data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser files and databases located in user profile directories, specifically: Local State files, Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, and Downloads databases in browser directories.",
  "sinks": "The data is written to local temporary files and then compressed into a ZIP archive, which is uploaded via an HTTP POST request to an external server specified by the base64-decoded URL.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser data files (sources), decrypted if necessary, written into temporary files, then compressed into a ZIP archive, and finally sent over the network to a remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code operates stealthily by collecting multiple sensitive data types without user consent, automatically zipping and exfiltrating the data. It uses base64 encoding to hide the server URL, and the entire process is automated without user interaction. The script also copies databases without verifying their integrity or origin, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed as a credential-stealing and data exfiltration tool targeting various browsers. It accesses local browser data, decrypts sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details, and collects browsing history, cookies, and downloads. The script constructs an archive of this data and uploads it to an external server covertly. Its methods for extracting and decrypting data are consistent with known malware techniques for credential theft. The use of environment variables and temporary directories is intended to operate silently. No benign functionality or legitimate purpose is apparent, and all activities are aimed at unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed for surreptitious data theft and exfiltration from user browsers. It employs obfuscation tactics like base64 encoding for the server URL and automates sensitive data harvesting without user consent. It presents a high security risk and should be considered malware.",
