{
  "purpose": "Collects specific Steam configuration and credential files, zips them, and uploads the archive to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)', directory listing of Steam folder, files starting with 'ssfn', 'config' directory, and temporary zip file.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to remote server with the zip file, file removal from temporary directory.",
  "flows": "Reads Steam credential/config files from the local system -> Zips these files -> Sends the zip via HTTP POST to a remote server -> Deletes the local zip file.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64 URL (decoded to a suspicious domain), collecting Steam credentials and config files without user consent, uploading sensitive data externally, lack of user notification, and handling of temp files in a potentially malicious manner.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a URL from a base64-encoded string, which points to a remote server. It then checks for the existence of the Steam directory in 'Program Files (x86)'. If found, it gathers 'ssfn' credential files and the 'config' directory, zips them, and uploads the archive to the decoded URL. After uploading, it attempts to delete the zip file locally. The process involves collecting potentially sensitive user data (Steam credentials and config files) and exfiltrating them without user awareness or consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to secretly collect sensitive Steam user files and exfiltrate them to a remote server, indicating malicious behavior aimed at data theft. It does not appear to serve any legitimate or benign purpose, and its behavior matches typical data exfiltration techniques.",
