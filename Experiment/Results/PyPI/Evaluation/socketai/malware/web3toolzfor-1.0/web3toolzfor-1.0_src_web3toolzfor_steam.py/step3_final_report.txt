  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded URL, searches for Steam session files ('ssfn*') and the 'config' directory, compresses these files into a zip archive, uploads it to the decoded URL via HTTP POST, and then deletes the archive. Its purpose is to exfiltrate potentially sensitive user data without consent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PROGRAMFILES(X86)'), accesses the Steam directory, lists files starting with 'ssfn', and reads files within the 'config' directory.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the zip archive containing sensitive files to a remote server via an HTTP POST request, and deletes the temporary zip file after upload.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and file system → Collection of 'ssfn*' files and 'config' directory → Compression into zip archive → Upload via HTTP POST to decoded URL → Deletion of temporary archive.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding to obfuscate the remote server URL; collects sensitive Steam files without user consent; performs silent file operations; lacks validation or encryption; hardcoded URL in obfuscated form.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 URL, searches for Steam-related files ('ssfn*' and 'config'), compresses them into a zip archive, uploads the archive to the decoded URL, and deletes the temporary file. It operates stealthily, exfiltrating sensitive user data without consent. The URL obfuscation via base64 suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The activity aligns with typical data-stealing malware targeting Steam credentials or session tokens. The code's behavior is malicious, with no benign purpose evident. The collection of files and silent upload constitute a security threat. The obfuscation level is moderate, justified by the base64 encoding. The activity's high potential for privacy invasion and credential theft warrants a high malware score (~0.9) and security risk (~0.9). The obfuscation score (~0.6) reflects the use of base64 encoding, which is a mild form of obfuscation but not complex. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious intent with high confidence, and the scores are consistent with its behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, designed to covertly exfiltrate sensitive Steam user data to a remote server. It employs obfuscation and stealth techniques, posing a high security risk. The activity aligns with malware behavior, justifying high malware and risk scores. The obfuscation is moderate, and the overall assessment confirms malicious intent and significant threat.",
