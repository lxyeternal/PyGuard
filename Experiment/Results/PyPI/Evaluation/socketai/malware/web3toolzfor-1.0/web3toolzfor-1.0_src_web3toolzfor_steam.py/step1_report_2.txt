{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect certain Steam configuration and session files, package them into a zip archive, and upload them to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), listing files in the Steam directory, reading Steam config files, and opening the zip file for reading.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL; deleting temporary files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file system data are collected, the relevant files are zipped, then uploaded over the network, followed by deletion of the temporary archive.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL suggests obfuscation. The script collects potentially sensitive Steam configuration files and session information without user consent. No validation or user prompts are present. The URL is hardcoded and decoded from base64, which is suspicious. The script writes files into the TEMP directory and then deletes them, possibly to hide its tracks.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64 URL, likely pointing to a malicious server. It locates the Steam directory under PROGRAMFILES(X86), gathers session files (ssfn*) and config files, then zips these files into a temporary archive. It then posts this archive to the decoded URL, which suggests exfiltration of user data. The code performs file system traversal and network communication without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation of the URL and the collection of sensitive Steam files are suspicious. There are no input validation or encryption measures. The deletion of the temporary zip file appears to hide evidence of the data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates Steam user data, including session files and configuration, to an external server, which is malicious behavior. The obfuscation of the URL and the stealthy file handling reinforce malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits high maliciousness and security risk.",
