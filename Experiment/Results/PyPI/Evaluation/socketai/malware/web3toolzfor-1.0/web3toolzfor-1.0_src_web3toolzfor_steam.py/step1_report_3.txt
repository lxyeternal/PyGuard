{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration and session files, compresses them, and uploads them to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)', 'TEMP'), listing files in the Steam directory, reading Steam configuration files, reading files from the zipped archive.",
  "sinks": "Request to remote URL with the zip file containing potentially sensitive data, file deletion after upload.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file system data are read, Steam files are gathered, zipped, and then uploaded via HTTP POST to the remote hook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL decoded from base64, collection of Steam session and config files without user consent, implicit use of environment variables, no validation or authentication, potential privacy violation. No validation on file contents. The code writes files directly into zip and then uploads, indicating data exfiltration intent.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a remote URL, constructs a path to Steam files, collects specific Steam-related files ('ssfn*' and 'config'), zips them, and uploads the zip to the decoded URL. The process involves reading potentially sensitive configuration and session files, which could be used for credential theft or user tracking. There are no input validation, authentication, or safeguards, suggesting malicious intent. The code operates silently without user knowledge, and deletes the temporary zip after upload, which indicates an attempt to avoid detection. Usage of environment variables and file handling is straightforward but focused on extracting and exfiltrating user data.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates Steam session and configuration files to a remote server, which is consistent with malicious data theft behavior. It lacks any user consent, validation, or benign purpose, indicating malicious intent.",
