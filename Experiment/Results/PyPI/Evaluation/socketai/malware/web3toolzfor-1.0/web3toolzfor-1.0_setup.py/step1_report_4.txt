  "purpose": "Configure package setup for publishing a Python project named 'web3toolzfor'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read during execution; all configuration data is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used or could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script purely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard setuptools functions and straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions and calls setup() with static metadata including package name, version, author details, package directory, URL, keywords, and required dependencies. All data appears standard for package configuration. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. Dependencies are common Python packages with no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful code. The package configuration appears benign and straightforward.",
