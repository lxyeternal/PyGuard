{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and find_packages; package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; typical setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for packaging, specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies. It uses find_packages to locate source packages in the 'src' directory. All fields appear standard for a Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dependencies are present. The dependencies listed ('requests', 'Pillow', 'pywin32') are common and benign, with no indications of malicious intent. The code is straightforward and typical of a standard Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply sets up a Python package for distribution.",
