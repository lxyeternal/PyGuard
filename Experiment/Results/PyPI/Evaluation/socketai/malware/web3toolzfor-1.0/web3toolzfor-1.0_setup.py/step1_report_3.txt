  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python project for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, calling setup() with project metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no code execution, network calls, or data handling within this script.",
  "flows": "The script primarily sets package metadata and dependencies, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Uses standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies source directory 'src' and lists dependencies such as requests, Pillow, and pywin32. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. The code appears standard for packaging a Python project. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on its content.",
