  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential theft and exfiltration of Discord/MFA tokens. It operates covertly, decoding a remote URL and sending sensitive data without user consent. The behavior aligns with typical credential-stealing malware, with no signs of obfuscation beyond simple base64 decoding. The malware score is set to 1, and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting high severity. The obfuscation is minimal, scored at 0.2, due to the URL decoding step. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat and should be treated as malicious."
