{
  "purpose": "The code searches various user data directories for Discord and MFA tokens, extracts them using regex, and exfiltrates the collected tokens via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL decoded from a base64 string, operating covertly without user consent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), files in user data directories (e.g., leveldb, log, sqlite files), and the decoded URL string.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the URL obtained from base64 decoding, sending a JSON payload containing the tokens.",
  "flows": "The code reads environment variables and files, applies regex to extract tokens, stores unique tokens, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via POST to the decoded URL.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding a suspicious URL from base64, operating silently without user notification, exfiltrating sensitive tokens, and accessing multiple user data directories without consent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs filesystem scans across multiple browser and application directories, extracting Discord and MFA tokens via regex patterns. It decodes a base64 string to obtain a webhook URL, then constructs a JSON payload with the tokens and sends it via an HTTP POST request. The operation is covert, with no user notification or validation, indicating malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, with minimal obfuscation (simple base64 decoding). The tokens are collected and exfiltrated silently, confirming malicious behavior. The use of environment variables and file access patterns are typical for credential harvesting malware. The code does not contain any benign functionality or legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential theft and exfiltration of Discord/MFA tokens. It operates covertly, decoding a remote URL and sending sensitive data without user consent. The behavior aligns with typical credential-stealing malware, with no signs of obfuscation beyond simple base64 decoding. The malware score is set to 1, and the security risk score is also 1, reflecting high severity. The obfuscation is minimal, scored at 0.2, due to the URL decoding step. Overall, the code poses a significant security threat and should be treated as malicious.",
