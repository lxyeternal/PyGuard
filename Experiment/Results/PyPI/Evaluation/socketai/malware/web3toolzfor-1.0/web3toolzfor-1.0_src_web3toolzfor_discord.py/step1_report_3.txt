{
  "purpose": "The script searches various browser and application data directories for Discord tokens and other sensitive information, then sends the collected tokens to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() calls for environment variables, os.path.exists(), os.listdir(), and open() for reading files in user data directories, re.findall() for pattern matching tokens.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to an external URL (decoded from base64) with JSON payload containing tokens, potentially leaking user tokens to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem reads (sources) collect tokens; regex finds token patterns; tokens are added to a list; the list is included in a JSON payload; payload is sent via HTTP POST request (sink) to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding a base64-encoded URL that points to a suspicious server, collecting sensitive tokens from various user data locations, and immediately sending this data externally without user consent. No user prompts or safeguards are present.",
  "analysis": "The code searches multiple directories associated with popular browsers and applications for Discord tokens and similar patterns. It uses environment variables to locate user data paths and searches for specific token regex patterns. Found tokens are compiled into a JSON structure with a hardcoded image and title. The data is then sent via an HTTP POST request to a decoded URL, which is obfuscated through base64 encoding. The purpose appears to be token theft, indicating malicious intent. The code operates silently without user interaction or warnings. It utilizes standard library functions for file I/O and regex, with no obfuscation or unusual code constructs. The decoding of the URL and immediate transmission of tokens strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is designed to extract Discord tokens and other sensitive data from user directories and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server. It exhibits clear malicious intent, with no legitimate purpose or user consent. The use of base64 decoding for the URL and silent network transmission confirm malicious behavior.",
