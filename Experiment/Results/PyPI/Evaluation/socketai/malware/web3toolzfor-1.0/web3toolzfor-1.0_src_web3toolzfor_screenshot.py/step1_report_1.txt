  "flows": "sikrinsat() reads user directory, captures screenshot, saves to temp file, reads file and sends via POST request, then deletes temp file",
  "anomalies": "Decodes a hardcoded base64 URL that points to an external server; no validation or checks; uses potentially risky screenshot capture and data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The function 'sikrinsat' captures a screenshot of the user's current screen, saves it temporarily, and uploads it to a URL decoded from base64. The URL appears to be external and potentially malicious, given the context of the code. The code does not validate the server response or handle errors beyond deleting the temporary file. The use of 'ImageGrab' to take screenshots and the automatic upload indicates potential privacy invasion and data exfiltration. The code’s purpose aligns with capturing user data without consent, and the URL is hardcoded and obfuscated via base64, which is common in malicious scripts. The code could be part of a surveillance or spyware tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code captures and exfiltrates a screenshot to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent. It operates stealthily by obfuscating the server URL and automating the data upload process, representing a privacy violation and potential malware component.",
