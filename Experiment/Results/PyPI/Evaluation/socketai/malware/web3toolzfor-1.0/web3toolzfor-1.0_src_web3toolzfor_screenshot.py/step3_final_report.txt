{
  "purpose": "Stealthily captures a screenshot of the user's desktop and exfiltrates it to an external server via a base64-encoded URL.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser, ImageGrab.grab, open() for file reading, base64.b64decode for URL decoding",
  "sinks": "requests.post for data exfiltration, os.remove for cleanup",
  "flows": "Reads user directory -> captures screenshot -> saves temporarily -> reads file -> uploads via POST request -> deletes file",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the destination URL; no validation or user notification; silent error handling on file deletion",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert screenshot capture and uploads the image to an external server decoded from a base64 string, indicating obfuscation. It operates stealthily without user consent, with minimal error handling, and exfiltrates user data, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. The URL's obfuscation and silent operation suggest malicious intent, aligning with data theft or spyware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through stealthy user data exfiltration via obfuscated URL, with no user notification or validation. It should be classified as malicious with high confidence, given its privacy invasion and obfuscation techniques.",
