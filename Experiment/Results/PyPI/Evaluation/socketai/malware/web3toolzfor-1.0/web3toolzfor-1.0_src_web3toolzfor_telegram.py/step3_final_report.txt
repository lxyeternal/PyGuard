{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram session data by copying the data directory, compressing it, and sending it to a remote server decoded from base64, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads the Telegram Desktop data directory and the ZIP archive file.",
  "sinks": "Sends the ZIP file via HTTP POST request to the decoded URL.",
  "flows": "Checks for data directory -> copies data -> compresses into ZIP -> reads ZIP -> posts to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding for URL obfuscation; the main function call is commented out, hiding active exfiltration; broad exception handling suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code's core behavior involves malicious data exfiltration of Telegram session files, employing obfuscation through base64 encoding and concealment via commenting out the function call. Although inactive by default, the structure indicates intent to exfiltrate sensitive data if activated. Error suppression and obfuscation tactics are typical of malicious scripts aiming to evade detection. The data flow from reading user data to network transmission is clear and consistent with malicious exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covertly stealing Telegram session data and sending it to an external server. Its obfuscation tactics and structure suggest high malicious intent. While currently dormant (function call commented out), it poses a significant security threat if activated. The overall malware score is high, and the security risk is substantial.",
