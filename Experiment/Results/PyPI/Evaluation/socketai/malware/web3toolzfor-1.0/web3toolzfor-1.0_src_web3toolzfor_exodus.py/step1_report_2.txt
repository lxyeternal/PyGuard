{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to copy a directory named 'Exodus' from the user's AppData Roaming folder, archive it, and then upload the archive to a remote server, potentially exfiltrating data.",
  "sources": "Reading user home directory, checking for the existence of the 'Exodus' folder, reading the 'Exodus' folder, opening the zip archive for upload.",
  "sinks": "Uploading the zip archive via HTTP POST request to an external URL (hook), deleting local copies of the archive and directory.",
  "flows": "User's home directory → Existence check → Directory copy → Archiving → File upload → Deletion of local files",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL decoded but not assigned to any variable, potential obfuscation; copying entire directory and uploading it without user consent; absence of validation or logging; use of broad exception handling; hardcoded path manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string which likely encodes a URL but does not assign it, suggesting obfuscation or an incomplete implementation. It checks if a specific folder exists in the user's AppData Roaming directory. If found, it copies this folder to a temporary location, archives it as a zip file, and then posts it to a remote server via a POST request, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data. It then attempts to delete the temporary files. The absence of error handling for network failures, lack of user consent, and the silent deletion of potentially sensitive data indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward but aimed at stealthy data extraction.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates the contents of the 'Exodus' directory to a remote server without user knowledge, indicating malicious behavior. The code's obfuscation via base64 decoding and its focus on copying and uploading user data suggest a supply chain attack or malware activity.",
