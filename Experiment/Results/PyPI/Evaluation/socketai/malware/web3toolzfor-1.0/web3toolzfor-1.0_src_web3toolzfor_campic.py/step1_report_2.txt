  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default camera and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) - reads input from the webcam; cap.read() - captures frame data from the camera.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite('image.png', frame) - writes the captured frame to disk.",
  "flows": "cv2.VideoCapture -> cap.read -> cv2.imwrite",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward image capture and save process with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam access, captures a single frame, saves it as an image file, then releases resources. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, or suspicious network activity. Usage of cv2 for image capture and save is standard. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote access, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of webcam capture functionality with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
