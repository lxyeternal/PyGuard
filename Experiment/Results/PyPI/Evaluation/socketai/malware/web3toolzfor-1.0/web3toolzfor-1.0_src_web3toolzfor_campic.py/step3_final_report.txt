  "purpose": "Capture a single image from the default webcam and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) to initialize webcam; cap.read() to capture frame.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() writes image to disk.",
  "flows": "Webcam input (source) -> frame captured (read) -> saved to disk (write).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of OpenCV functions; no obfuscation, network activity, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the webcam, captures one frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. It uses standard OpenCV functions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The code is simple, clear, and performs a benign operation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign webcam image capture utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
