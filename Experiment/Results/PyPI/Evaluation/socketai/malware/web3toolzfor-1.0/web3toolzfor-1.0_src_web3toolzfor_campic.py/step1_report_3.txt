  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default camera and save it as image.png",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) (camera device), cap.read() (frame data), cv2.imwrite() (saving image)",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() writes image data to a file; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Camera input -> frame captured -> saved as image.png",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Uses standard OpenCV functions for image capture and saving.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the camera device, captures a single frame, saves it to disk, and releases resources. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The functions used are standard for image capture tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image capture script with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be intended solely for capturing and saving an image from the camera.",
