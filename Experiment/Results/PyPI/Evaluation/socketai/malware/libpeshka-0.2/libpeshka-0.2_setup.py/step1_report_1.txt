{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with an embedded function 'rn' that performs potentially malicious activities, including downloading and executing a remote file, modifying shell configuration, and establishing persistence.",
  "sources": "The function 'rn' reads data from a remote URL (http://145.249.104.71/out) and the current system environment (platform).",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is saved as '.drv' and made executable; then the code appends a command to '.bashrc' to execute '.drv' on shell startup, potentially establishing persistence and executing remote code.",
  "flows": "The remote content is fetched ('urllib2.urlopen') -> written to a local file ('.drv') -> made executable ('os.chmod') -> command added to '.bashrc' to execute it; this allows remote code execution and persistence.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded remote URL, execution of remote payload, modification of '.bashrc' for persistence, use of old 'urllib2' module (Python 2), unusual inclusion of malicious code within setup script, lack of obfuscation but presence of suspicious behavior. Also, the function is called during import, which is uncommon and risky.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, then defines 'rn' which fetches a payload from a hardcoded IP address. It then writes this payload to '.drv', makes it executable, and appends a command to '.bashrc' to run this payload automatically. The 'setup' call specifies package details and references 'rn' as an entry point. The inclusion of code that downloads and persists remote code execution during setup is highly suspicious, indicating malicious intent, such as remote control or backdoor. The code structure is straightforward but embedded malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior—downloading remote code, establishing persistence, and executing potentially harmful payloads—embedded within a package setup script. The activity indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent and security risk.",
