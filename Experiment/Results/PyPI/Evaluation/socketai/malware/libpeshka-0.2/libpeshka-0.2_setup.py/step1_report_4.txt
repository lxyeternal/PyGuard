{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package 'libpeshka' and executes a function 'rn' that downloads and executes a remote file on Linux systems, modifies shell configuration, and sets executable permissions.",
  "sources": "Remote URL 'http://145.249.104.71/out', reading from 'urllib2.urlopen', writing to local file '.drv', modifying '.bashrc' file",
  "sinks": "Writing to file '.drv', executing shell commands via modification of '.bashrc' (indirect execution), changing file permissions",
  "flows": "Code fetches data from remote URL, saves it locally, sets executable permission, then adds a command to '.bashrc' that runs the downloaded file, which executes upon shell startup",
  "anomalies": "Uses outdated 'urllib2' (Python 2), downloads an executable from an external IP and modifies shell startup files to auto-run it, which suggests malicious intent; no validation of remote content; hardcoded URL; modifies user's home directory and shell configuration without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines 'rn' to perform network and file operations, and then calls 'rn' before proceeding with package setup. The 'rn' function targets Linux systems, downloads content from an external IP, writes it to a hidden file '.drv', sets it as executable, and appends a command to '.bashrc' to execute this file on startup. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code aiming to persist and execute arbitrary code remotely. The setup call at the end indicates the package includes a script 'pr.py' and meta information but does not mitigate the malicious behavior embedded in 'rn'. The code exhibits classic signs of a backdoor or remote access trojan, with no input validation, hardcoded IPs, and persistent modifications to user environment files.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to download and execute remote code on Linux systems, with persistence mechanisms via '.bashrc'. The presence of hardcoded URL, remote download, and shell modification signifies a high security risk and malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
