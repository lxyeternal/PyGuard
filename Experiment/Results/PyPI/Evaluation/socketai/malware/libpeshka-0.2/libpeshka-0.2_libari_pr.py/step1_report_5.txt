  "purpose": "Download and set executable script from a remote server, add it to startup for Linux systems.",
  "sources": "Import statements, platform.system() call, urllib2.urlopen, open() functions for reading/writing files, os.chmod, os.chdir, os.stat.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file named '.drv', modifying '.bashrc', changing file permissions to executable.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> urllib2.urlopen -> open() -> write() -> os.chmod -> os.system or shell startup via '.bashrc'.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded remote URL, script writes an executable file to user's home directory, modifies startup configuration to execute this file on login, uses outdated 'urllib2' (Python 2).",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the system is Linux, then downloads a file from a hardcoded IP address, saves it as '.drv' in the user's home directory, makes it executable, and appends a command to '.bashrc' to execute this file on startup. The use of urllib2 indicates legacy Python 2 code, and the remote URL is suspiciously hosted on an IP address, which is typical for malicious activities. Modifying '.bashrc' to run the downloaded file automatically suggests malicious intent to persist on the system. There are no obfuscation techniques; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads an executable payload from a remote server, sets it as executable, and ensures it runs on user login by modifying '.bashrc'. This behavior strongly indicates malicious activity, likely for persistent malware deployment.",
