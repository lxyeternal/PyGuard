  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, and potential data leaks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, network connections, subprocess calls, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, subprocess execution, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly via dynamic code execution or subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscation patterns, unusual code structures, potential backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no malicious behavior if it lacks eval/exec on untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, or network connections. Suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution and network activity increase risk. Obfuscation suspicion further elevates concern. Benign code shows straightforward patterns with no signs of sabotage. The overall assessment aligns with the scores: benign for reports 1, 3, 4, 5; suspicious for report 2.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, report 2 indicates behaviors consistent with moderate malicious intent, justified by eval/exec and network suspicion. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action required unless code snippets confirm malicious activity.",
