{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths since the code only declares exception classes without logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. There are no data handling, network operations, or logic flows present. The structure is straightforward and purely declarative, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. Since no external input, output, or sensitive data processing occurs, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. It simply establishes error types for use elsewhere in a larger codebase.",
