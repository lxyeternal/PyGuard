  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; all are class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted input; static class definitions without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are straightforward exception definitions; no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy error conditions and connection errors. No input handling, data processing, or network communication occurs within this snippet. The structure is simple and typical for defining exception hierarchies, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no suspicious operations, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign application code.",
