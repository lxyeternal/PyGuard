  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no functions, data processing, network interactions, or runtime logic. The classes inherit from standard exceptions, forming a hierarchy for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is typical for establishing error handling in network modules.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code does not perform any data handling, external communication, or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is benign, standard, and part of a larger codebase likely responsible for SOCKS proxy handling. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's scope.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements or Adjustments**  \nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, no changes are necessary. The scores are reasonable, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign, straightforward, and does not pose any security threats. It serves as a foundation for error handling in a larger SOCKS proxy implementation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
