  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points; solely class definitions for exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; purely class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exception handling related to SOCKS proxy errors. Each class is a simple subclass of a built-in exception or other custom exceptions, with no executable logic, data manipulation, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard way to structure custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
