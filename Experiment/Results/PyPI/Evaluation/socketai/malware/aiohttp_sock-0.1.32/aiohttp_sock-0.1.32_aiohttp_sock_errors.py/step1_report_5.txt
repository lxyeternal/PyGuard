  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to SOCKS proxy and authentication.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; class definitions for exceptions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely class declarations without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code behavior; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or any suspicious activities. The classes are named appropriately for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. No code obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling purposes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for SOCKS proxy interactions, but on its own, it poses no threat.",
