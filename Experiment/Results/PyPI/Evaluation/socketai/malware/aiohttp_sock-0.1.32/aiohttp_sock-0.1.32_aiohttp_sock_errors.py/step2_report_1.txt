  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and typical for error handling in network modules.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Score justification:** The report assigns a security risk of 0 and malware of 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Any issues?** The report is thorough and correctly concludes the code is benign.\n- **Potential score adjustment?** No, the scores are appropriate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Score justification:** Same as above; scores are consistent with the code.\n- **Any issues?** The reasoning is sound.\n- **Potential score adjustment?** No.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Score justification:** Again, consistent and appropriate.\n- **Any issues?** No, the report is accurate.\n- **Potential score adjustment?** No.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Score justification:** Properly assessed; no malicious activity.\n- **Any issues?** No.\n- **Potential score adjustment?** No.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Score justification:** Correctly identified as benign.\n- **Any issues?** No.\n- **Potential score adjustment?** No.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is correct given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign and safe, serving as a typical exception hierarchy for network error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in the larger codebase, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
