  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just class definitions; no executable logic or data processing.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, so scores are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; only class definitions.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assesses the code as harmless.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; straightforward exception classes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; simple exception hierarchy.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; class definitions only.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, since no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — benign exception class definitions.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a typical, safe set of exception class definitions for a network module.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.",
