  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No input/output, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and intended for error handling in a larger application.\n\n**Confirmation of code content:**\n- The code matches the descriptions: classes inherit from Exception or OSError, with no additional logic.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n- Malware scores are 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n- Security risks are also 0, aligning with the above.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are apparent; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which is correct given the code snippet.\n- No hidden or obfuscated code is present that could conceal malicious behavior.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard exception hierarchy for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are appropriate, and there are no concerns regarding security or malicious activity.",
