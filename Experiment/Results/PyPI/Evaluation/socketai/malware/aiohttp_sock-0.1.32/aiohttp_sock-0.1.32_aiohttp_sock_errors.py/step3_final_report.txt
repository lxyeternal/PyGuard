  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and OSError, serving as error indicators.",
  "sinks": "No data input, external communication, or processing; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; exception classes are used for error handling elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy and connection error exceptions. It lacks executable logic, data handling, or network interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. The high confidence (1) in these assessments is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy for network error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security concerns present. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
