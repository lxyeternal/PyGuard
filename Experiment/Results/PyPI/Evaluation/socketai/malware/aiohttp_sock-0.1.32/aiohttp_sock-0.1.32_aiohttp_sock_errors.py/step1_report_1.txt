  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general connection errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data collection occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external communication is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or exception handling flow involves external inputs or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exception types, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. It defines a hierarchy of exceptions for SOCKS proxy and connection errors, which is typical in network-related modules. There are no active operations, data handling, or external interactions. No potential vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward exception class declaration without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for handling specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxies and connections. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and presents no security risks. It is likely part of a larger module but alone is benign.",
