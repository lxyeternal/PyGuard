{
  "purpose": "This code implements an aiohttp proxy connector supporting multiple proxy types, with dynamic URL construction, socket wrapping, and DNS resolution options.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parameters, user-provided host, port, username, password, and external helper functions (create_socket_wrapper, parse_proxy_url).",
  "sinks": "The constructed proxy URL, socket connection via create_socket_wrapper, and network connection initiation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port, credentials) are used to generate proxy URL and socket connections; socket wrapper may influence network flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Reliance on external create_socket_wrapper is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only external dependency, create_socket_wrapper, is a black box, which could be a concern if malicious, but no evidence suggests so. Input handling is typical, and the logic aligns with common proxy setup practices. The malware score is justified as 0 due to the absence of malicious indicators. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard proxy handling with minimal potential vulnerabilities. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe, pending external helper review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard aiohttp proxy connector with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reliance on external socket wrapper warrants separate review, but within this scope, the implementation is safe.",
