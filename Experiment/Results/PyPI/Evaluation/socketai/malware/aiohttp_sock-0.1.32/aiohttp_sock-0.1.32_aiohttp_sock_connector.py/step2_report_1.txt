  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code implements a proxy connector with dynamic URL construction, socket wrapping, and support for multiple proxy types. It notes that `create_socket_wrapper` is a black box, which is a potential concern, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The logic aligns with standard proxy handling.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Given the absence of malicious indicators, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which seems reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proxy URL parsing, socket creation, and connection handling. It notes no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Standard implementation, with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0, security risk 0.2, which is acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on the flexibility of the proxy connector, handling user input for proxy configuration. It notes that URL construction from user input is standard, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, matching the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Highlights the use of a NoResolver class, dynamic proxy URL creation, and socket wrapping. It notes that no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Findings:** Standard patterns, no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, emphasizing the standard approach for proxy setup, socket wrapping, and parameter handling. No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with the assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code relies on external helpers, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard proxy handling without evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard proxy code)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**No adjustments are necessary.**",
