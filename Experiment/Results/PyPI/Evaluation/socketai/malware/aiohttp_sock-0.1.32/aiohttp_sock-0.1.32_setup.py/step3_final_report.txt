{
  "purpose": "The code decodes base64-encoded scripts and VBScript files, writes them into temporary directories, and executes a VBScript via subprocess, all while heavily obfuscating its payloads. It appears designed to stealthily run malicious scripts or backdoors, potentially exfiltrating data or establishing remote control.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('USERPROFILE'), reading '__init__.py' for version, base64-encoded payloads, subprocess calls for dependency installation, writing scripts to temp directories, decoding base64 strings into scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main.scripts.cpython-39.vbs' via Popen with 'shell=True', running decoded scripts, dynamic code execution, writing files in user temp directories, dependency installation without clear purpose.",
  "flows": "Base64 payloads decoded and written as scripts, scripts stored in temp directories, then executed via subprocess/Popen, potentially leading to malicious payload execution or backdoor setup.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy reliance on base64 encoding/decoding, dynamic script creation, execution in temp directories, use of 'shell=True', obfuscated code, reliance on environment variables for paths, multiple dependency installations without clear necessity.",
  "analysis": "The script installs dependencies, decodes multiple base64-encoded scripts, writes them into user temp directories, and executes a VBScript, all with obfuscation techniques. The code's behavior suggests stealthy execution of malicious payloads, such as backdoors or data exfiltration scripts. The use of encoded content, dynamic file creation, and execution via 'shell=True' are classic indicators of malware. The high level of obfuscation and encoded payloads further support malicious intent. The code's actions align with typical malware tactics to evade detection and maintain persistence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits all hallmarks of malicious activity: obfuscation, dynamic code execution, encoded payloads, and stealthy file operations. It is highly suspicious and likely malicious, warranting immediate security measures. The malware score is set to 1, the obfuscated score to 1, and the overall security risk to 1, consistent with the observed behaviors.",
