{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package, install dependencies, and then execute obfuscated scripts likely designed to perform malicious activities such as data collection, remote command execution, or other harmful actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (environ['USERPROFILE']), reading the __init__.py for version info, external dependencies via subprocess calls, and decoding embedded base64 scripts written to files.",
  "sinks": "Writing decoded scripts to files in TEMP directory, executing a VBScript file via Popen, and potentially executing obfuscated Python code or scripts that could perform unauthorized system access or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and decoded script content flow into file writes; the base64-decoded scripts are executed via system calls. The obfuscated scripts (main.cpython-39.pyw and VBScript) are run, potentially executing malicious payloads in the background.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to embed code, creation of files in TEMP directory, obfuscated scripts, dynamic execution of scripts (.vbs and .py), and decoding and running scripts that may contain malicious logic. The script content is heavily obfuscated, indicating potential concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and retrieving version info from __init__.py, then installs dependencies via subprocess. It creates directories and decodes base64-encoded scripts that are written to files in a TEMP directory. These scripts are obfuscated, containing code that appears to perform network requests, data collection, and remote control functions. The code then executes a VBScript file that likely launches further malicious behavior. The obfuscation, dynamic code generation, and execution of hidden scripts strongly suggest malicious activity, such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or persistent backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to heavy obfuscation, decoding embedded scripts, and executing scripts that could perform malicious activities without user awareness. The intent appears to be to set up a backdoor, perform remote command execution, or exfiltrate data, making it unsafe to execute or include in any environment.",
