  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5).\n- Parses proxy URLs, extracts credentials, and creates socket wrappers.\n- Uses external libraries (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`) for proxy handling.\n- Validates inputs and handles exceptions appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard utility for proxy connections.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. They agree that the code is standard, validates inputs, and handles exceptions properly.  \n  **Yes, no issues are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code safely handles untrusted input, validates parameters, and uses external libraries appropriately.  \n  **No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.**\n\n### Scoring Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.2, which is moderate but acceptable given the network nature; the code handles untrusted input but does not exhibit risky behaviors.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are consistent with the code's behavior and analysis.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.  \n- The malware score is 0, justified by the lack of malicious behavior.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, justified by the code's clarity.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is secure.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports assume that the external libraries are secure and that the code's input validation is sufficient.  \n- No suspicious assumptions or claims are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues found.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (moderate, but justified)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections. It handles untrusted input securely, uses external libraries appropriately, and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The moderate risk score accounts for the fact that, if misused, proxy configuration inputs could be exploited, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed to the scores. The reports are consistent and justified.",
