{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers for asynchronous connections.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URLs (parse_proxy_url), input parameters for connection functions (host, port, socks_url, proxy_type, username, password), environment variables (none explicitly used), configuration parameters (socks_host, socks_port, rdns, family).",
  "sinks": "Creating socket wrappers (create_socket_wrapper), opening network connections (asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection), potentially using untrusted data in proxy URL parsing and socket creation.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters -> parse_proxy_url extracts proxy info -> create_socket_wrapper creates SOCKS socket -> connect via sock.connect -> establish connection via asyncio functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Proxy URL parsing handles untrusted input but correctly unquotes and validates components. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration code observed. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage detected. The code depends on external libraries (aiohttp_sock, yarl) for proxy handling but uses them straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection helpers. It parses user-provided proxy URLs, creates appropriate socket wrappers, and establishes connections through proxies. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The handling of proxy URL parameters is safe and includes validation. The use of external libraries is appropriate for the purpose and does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is evident. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate network connection setup, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for establishing proxy-based network connections. It handles user inputs safely, validates components, and uses external libraries responsibly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
