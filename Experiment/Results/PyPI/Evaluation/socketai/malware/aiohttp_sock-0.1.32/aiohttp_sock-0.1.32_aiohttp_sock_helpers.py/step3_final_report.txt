{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and connection handling.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, environment variables (via asyncio.get_event_loop()), external libraries (`aiohttp_sock`, `yarl`).",
  "sinks": "Socket creation and connection establishment, passing socket to asyncio's `open_connection` or `create_connection` functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from user-provided URLs or parameters flows through parsing and validation functions, then to socket wrapper creation, and finally to network connection functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Input validation is appropriate, and no malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. It validates URL components, handles exceptions, and uses external libraries correctly. No malicious or backdoor code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose. External dependencies are standard, and input handling appears secure. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SOCKS proxy connections with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.",
