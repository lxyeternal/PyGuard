  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds the code standard, legitimate, and free of suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code is indeed a typical implementation of SOCKS proxies, handling address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation.\n- No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the network-related operations, though the code does handle sensitive data (hostnames, credentials), but nothing malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, proper error handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The very low security risk score (0.1) is justified, considering the code's purpose and lack of hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- The high confidence aligns with the thoroughness.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment and scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code performs typical address resolution, proxy negotiation, and optional authentication.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The security risk score remains low, reflecting the legitimate nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard SOCKS4/5 proxy wrappers with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code is straightforward, with proper handling of network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n- The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code handles proxy connections securely, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers. No malicious, obfuscated, or backdoor code is present.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is consistent with the code review.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code (proxy clients), a low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, as the code handles network connections and credentials but does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence (0.9-0.95) reflects thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — standard network code with potential for misuse if misconfigured, but no inherent risks.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected.",
