{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asyncio, handling connection negotiation, address resolution, and optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs for proxy server and destination address resolution; user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations (sock_sendall, sock_recv, sock_connect) that transmit data over the network; potentially sensitive data like credentials and hostnames.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flow into socket requests and authentication steps; network responses flow back into the code for validation and further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard proxy protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies using asyncio, with proper error handling, address resolution, and optional authentication. No suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The network operations are typical for proxy clients, and the code does not perform any covert actions or data exfiltration. The security considerations are limited to the inherent risks of proxy usage, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
