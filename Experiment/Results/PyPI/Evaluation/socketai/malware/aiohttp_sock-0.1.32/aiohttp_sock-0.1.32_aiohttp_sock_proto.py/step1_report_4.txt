{
  "purpose": "Implement SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include: input parameters (host, port, user credentials), socket address resolution, data received from proxy responses.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data flows include: proxy server connection, authentication credentials, and address resolution results.",
  "flows": "Source (inputs, credentials, address resolution) → proxy connection establishment → negotiation and authentication → data exchange.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard socket and asyncio patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow observed. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes for managing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously. It performs address resolution, negotiation, and optional authentication via username/password. No hardcoded secrets are detected. The handling of data sending/receiving is straightforward and standard, with proper exception handling for network errors. No suspicious code behaviors, such as data exfiltration or malicious network activity, are present. The code appears to be a typical implementation of proxy socket wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It responsibly handles network connections and credentials without hardcoding secrets or performing unintended actions.",
