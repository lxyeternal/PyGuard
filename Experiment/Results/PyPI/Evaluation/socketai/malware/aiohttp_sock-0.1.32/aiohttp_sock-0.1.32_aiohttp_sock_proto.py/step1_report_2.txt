{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection wrappers, enabling asynchronous socket connections through proxies with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and user ID during initialization and address resolution during connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to and received from proxy servers, and potentially untrusted address data could influence connection behaviors. No sensitive data is explicitly transmitted or stored. No external untrusted input is directly used in critical operations like code execution.",
  "flows": "Address resolution flows from input host to socket address; proxy connection flows from socket connection to proxy server, followed by negotiation and address request/response, ultimately leading to data transfer over the established connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard socket handling and proxy negotiation logic. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code handles exceptions appropriately, and no unusual or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS proxy protocols (version 4 and 5) using asyncio for asynchronous I/O, including address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It performs expected network operations with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, or data leaks are evident. No malicious behavior such as unauthorized data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious commands are present. The functions follow typical patterns for proxy handling and do not involve obfuscated code or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard proxy negotiation and connection tasks safely and transparently. No malicious behaviors or sabotage signals are detected.",
