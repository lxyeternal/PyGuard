  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxy client implementation with no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code matches the description: it performs proxy negotiation, address resolution, and socket management without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy connection handling, with proper error management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears legitimate, implementing SOCKS protocols correctly. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows are evident.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers with address resolution, authentication, and negotiation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. It handles user inputs and network communication properly.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy wrappers, no hardcoded secrets, standard socket handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. The implementation is typical and secure.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious behavior, standard procedures.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is consistent with a legitimate proxy client, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the standard nature of the code with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for asyncio.\n- No suspicious or malicious operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are detected.\n- The low risk scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to network handling, but no vulnerabilities or malicious features)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.",
