{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions to establish and manage SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "User input (hostnames, IP addresses, ports) during the connection process; internal method calls for address resolution and connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over the network via socket operations; potential data leaks if sensitive info is transmitted unencrypted or logged improperly.",
  "flows": "Host/IP input → address resolution → connection request formation → data transmission over sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code primarily performs network connection setup and proxy negotiation. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers with asynchronous support. It handles address resolution, proxy negotiation, and socket communication. It carefully manages socket resources, performs address validation, and raises appropriate exceptions for errors. No suspicious or malicious operations such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or covert channels are present. The code appears to be a legitimate component for proxy management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers designed for legitimate network communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment. It seems to be a standard, security-conscious implementation of proxy negotiation logic.",
