{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user-supplied hostnames, ports, and optional credentials; retrieves address info via getaddrinfo; reads responses from proxy servers.",
  "sinks": "Sends connection requests and authentication data to proxy servers; receives responses from proxy servers; resolves hostnames potentially with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "User provides hostname and port -> resolve address -> connect to proxy -> negotiate authentication and connection -> send/receive data through proxy.",
  "anomalies": "Uses only standard socket and asyncio libraries; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious data manipulation; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies for network connections with asyncio. It includes proper error handling, address resolution, and negotiation procedures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The only potential concern could be the handling of user-provided hostnames and credentials, but this is typical for proxy implementations and not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code constructs or behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as expected for proxy communication, with no malicious behavior detected.",
