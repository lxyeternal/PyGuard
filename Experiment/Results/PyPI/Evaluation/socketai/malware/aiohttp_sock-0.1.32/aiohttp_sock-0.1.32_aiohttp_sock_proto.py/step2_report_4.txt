  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, logical consistency, and scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Assessment**: The reviewer states the code is a standard SOCKS4/5 proxy implementation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification**: Given the code's straightforward nature, no signs of malicious intent, and proper handling, these scores seem reasonable.\n- **Potential adjustments**: The securityRisk score of 0.2 is slightly cautious but acceptable considering potential misconfigurations or misuse in broader contexts.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard, legitimate proxy handling without malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Justification**: The low security risk aligns with the code's apparent benign purpose.\n- **Potential adjustments**: The very low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the securityRisk is conservatively low.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Assessment**: Again, the code is a typical SOCKS proxy wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification**: The scores are consistent with the analysis; the code handles user input and network operations securely.\n- **Potential adjustments**: No change needed.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Assessment**: The report describes a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification**: The low security risk is appropriate given the code's function.\n- **Potential adjustments**: No change needed.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Assessment**: Similar to others, no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification**: The code appears standard and secure; the scores are justified.\n- **Potential adjustments**: No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, and the code is straightforward, readable, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: Slight variation between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal potential risks like misconfiguration or misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware**: 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk**: 0.1 — minor risks due to handling user input and network operations, but overall low.\n\n### Summary:\nThe scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the risk scores are appropriately conservative.",
