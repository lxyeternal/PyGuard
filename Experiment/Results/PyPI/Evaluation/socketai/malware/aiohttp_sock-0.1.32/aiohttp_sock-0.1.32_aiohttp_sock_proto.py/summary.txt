  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified."
