{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections, including negotiation and connection establishment with proxies.",
  "sources": "Reads input from socket connections, address resolution via getaddrinfo, and potentially user-provided parameters such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over socket connections, particularly proxy negotiation requests, and receives responses from proxy servers. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident outside network communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) are used to build requests; these are sent to proxy servers; responses are received and parsed; successful negotiation leads to a connected socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Error handling appears standard. No code that connects to external malicious domains or performs unexpected data exfiltration. Proxy configuration is parameterized, with no hardcoded secrets. No evidence of hidden backdoors or malicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection handling, with methods for address resolution, authentication, and negotiation. It uses standard Python libraries and asyncio for asynchronous operations. Error handling is implemented properly for network errors and proxy responses. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code performs expected proxy handshake procedures. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. The design appears consistent with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers for asyncio, with no malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. It handles proxy negotiation securely, with no evident backdoors or malicious data leaks. The overall security risk is low.",
