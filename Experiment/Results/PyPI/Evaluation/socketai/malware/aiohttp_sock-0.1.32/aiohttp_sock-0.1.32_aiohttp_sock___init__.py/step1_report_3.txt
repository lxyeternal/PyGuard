{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes, functions, and constants related to SOCKS proxy connections, including error handling and connection helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present; the code primarily imports and re-exports components.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are shown; the code solely defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, sets a version string, and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no signs of data handling, external network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code serves as a module interface, likely for a proxy client library, with no embedded malicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module that exports classes, functions, and constants related to SOCKS proxy handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
