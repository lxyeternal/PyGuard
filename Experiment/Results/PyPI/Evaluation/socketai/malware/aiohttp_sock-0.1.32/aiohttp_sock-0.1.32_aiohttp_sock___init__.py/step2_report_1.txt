  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports and exports classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections. The code does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data, or perform network operations within this snippet.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in this code fragment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple interface setup with no suspicious activity. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Security Risk:** The reports assign very low or zero security risk scores, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports rate obfuscation as 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n- **Confidence:** All are at maximum confidence (1), which is justified.\n\nNo adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is purely an import/export interface with no embedded logic, network activity, or data handling, there is no justification for any risk scores above 0.5. The current scores reflect this accurately.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe what the code does—importing and exporting components—without speculation about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's content: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1** (already low, indicating minimal risk, which is reasonable for a module interface)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard Python module serving as an interface for a proxy connection library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
