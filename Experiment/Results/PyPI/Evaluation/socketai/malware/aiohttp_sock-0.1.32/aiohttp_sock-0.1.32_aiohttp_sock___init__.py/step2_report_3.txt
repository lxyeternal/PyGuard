  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), defines a version string, and exposes these via the `__all__` list. It appears to serve as an interface or initialization file for a proxy connection library, likely related to SOCKS proxies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Functionality:** It only performs import and export operations, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- **Security concerns:** No hardcoded secrets, no network calls, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **None detected.** The code functions as a standard module initializer or API interface.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — Given the code's simplicity and lack of risks, this seems appropriate. It is a benign module setup.\n\n### Justification:\nSince all reports agree that the code is a typical, safe module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the scores seem reasonable. The malware score of 0 accurately reflects the absence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score of 0 is justified by the clear, readable code.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **No suspicious assumptions:** The reports correctly identify that the code is just setting up exports for a proxy library, with no embedded logic that could be malicious.\n- **No inconsistencies:** The scores align with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Very low, reflecting minimal inherent risk in a module that only imports/exports.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
