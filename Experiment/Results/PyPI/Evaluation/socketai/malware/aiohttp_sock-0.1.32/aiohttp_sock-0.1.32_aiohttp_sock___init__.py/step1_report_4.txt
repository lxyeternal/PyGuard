{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a proxy connection library, providing classes, error definitions, and helper functions for proxy operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto); reading of module attributes (__version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leakage or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly present; the code mainly imports and defines exports without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes, functions, and constants from local modules, then defines its public interface and version. No input handling, output, or data processing occurs here. It does not include any network activity, data manipulation, or execution of untrusted input. The structure and syntax are normal, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an import and export interface for a proxy-related Python package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
