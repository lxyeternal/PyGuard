{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface or initialization module for a proxy connection library, importing and exposing classes, functions, and constants related to SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) during import time.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import and export of components; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules and defines a version string and a public API list. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is typical for a Python package's interface or __init__.py file. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard interface module for a proxy library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
