  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple module that imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n   - It defines a version string and an `__all__` list to specify the public API.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling within this snippet.\n   - The code appears to serve as an interface or entry point for a larger proxy connection library.\n\n2. **Security Concerns and Anomalies:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted code, network connections, or data leaks.\n   - The version string is straightforward and non-sensitive.\n   - The code structure is typical for a Python package's initialization or interface module.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, the risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high; a score of 0 or 0.1 is reasonable, but not indicating any real threat.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports are consistent and do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - Since the code is purely import/export boilerplate, there are no vulnerabilities or exploits to consider here.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or conclusions based on the provided code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - The reports' conclusions are accurate and justified.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, non-specific security risk, possibly just a default placeholder)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores and reports are aligned with this assessment.",
