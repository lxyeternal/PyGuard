{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to define an interface for a proxy connection library, importing various components such as connection handlers, error classes, and protocol types, and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling in the code; no execution of untrusted input, network connections, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A — the code mainly consists of imports and exports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The version string is simple and non-sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer, importing classes, functions, and constants, then defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network activity occurs here. It relies on other modules for functionality, but within this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export pattern with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. It appears safe and typical for a Python package interface definition.",
