{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy connection, including error handling, connection helpers, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions are present; the code imports modules and assigns metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data; the code mainly sets up exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is primarily defining and exporting symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports components from sibling modules and exposes them via __all__ and a version string. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar setup file, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup file, exporting symbols related to SOCKS proxy functionality. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a network-related Python package.",
