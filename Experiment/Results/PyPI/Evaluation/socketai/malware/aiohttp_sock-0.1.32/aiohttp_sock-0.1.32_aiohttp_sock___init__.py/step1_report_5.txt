  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export components related to proxy connections, including error handling, connection helpers, and proxy types.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and specific components from relative files within the package: connector, errors, helpers, proto.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network calls, or handle untrusted input directly within this fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows within this code snippet; it mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns are present. The import structure and module metadata seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines a version string and an __all__ list for exports. It primarily serves as an interface or API setup for other parts of the package. No network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs here. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual logic. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py or main module file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package module that exports classes and functions related to proxy handling. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
