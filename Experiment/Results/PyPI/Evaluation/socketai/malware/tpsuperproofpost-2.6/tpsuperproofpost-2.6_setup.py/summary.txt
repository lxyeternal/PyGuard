  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, contacting a known malicious domain. The silent failure concealment and external communication further indicate malicious intent. The assigned high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified. The package should be treated as malicious and avoided or further analyzed in a secure environment."
