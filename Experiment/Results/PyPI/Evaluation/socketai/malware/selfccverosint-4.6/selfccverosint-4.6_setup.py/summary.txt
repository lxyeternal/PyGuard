  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded, obfuscated PowerShell code executed covertly during setup, indicating high malicious potential. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and embedded URL confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, the malware score should be slightly increased to 0.9 to reflect the confirmed malicious activity. Overall, this package is highly dangerous and should be flagged for removal or further investigation."
