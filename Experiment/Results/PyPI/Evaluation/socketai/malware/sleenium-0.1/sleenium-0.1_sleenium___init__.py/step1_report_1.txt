{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or application logic, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or external files; possibly fetches data from network sources if network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, prints to console, or transmits data over the network; may include database queries or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or backdoor patterns detected. Unusual language features or dynamic code execution are not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard use of Python syntax. No signs of malicious patterns like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining. It is necessary to confirm if external network calls or sensitive operations are present in parts of the code not provided. The code structure does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious code paths supports benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard application logic without malicious intent. Confidence in this conclusion is high due to the clarity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
