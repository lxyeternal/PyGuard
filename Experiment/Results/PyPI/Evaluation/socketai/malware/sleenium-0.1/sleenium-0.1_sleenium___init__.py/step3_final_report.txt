  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, user inputs, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "File writes, network connections, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) via data processing and dynamic code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, complex or unusual language features, potential backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe code as benign with no suspicious patterns, except Report 5 which notes obfuscation and dynamic code features. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions: Reports 1-4 have malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, with high confidence; Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code, with malware=0.3, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.45, confidence=0.6. Given the lack of actual code snippets, these assessments are cautious but justified. The high obfuscation and dynamic features in Report 5 justify higher suspicion, though no concrete malicious actions are confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The overall code appears benign in most reports, with Report 5 indicating potential obfuscation and suspicious features. Scores are appropriately assigned based on available descriptions. For definitive assessment, actual code review is recommended. Current scores reflect cautious suspicion in Report 5 but no confirmed malicious activity.",
