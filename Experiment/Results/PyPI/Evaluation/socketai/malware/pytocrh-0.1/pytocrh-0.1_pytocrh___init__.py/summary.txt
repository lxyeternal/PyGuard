  "malware_score": 0.6,
  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1 indicates moderate suspicion justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence for suspicion. The current scoring is appropriate, with a minor adjustment to Report 4's malware score for accuracy."
