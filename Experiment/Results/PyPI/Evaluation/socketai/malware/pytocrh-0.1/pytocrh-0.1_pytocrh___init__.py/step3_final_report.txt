  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), exec(), dynamic data handling, environment variables, network or file I/O, obfuscated variable names, minimal comments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() leading to network/file sinks or environment variables, possibly via obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() without sanitization, obfuscated variable names, minimal comments, dynamic code constructs, inconsistent or suspicious patterns of data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code shows patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Suspicious patterns include use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, and minimal documentation. Benign code lacks these indicators. The scores assigned (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.7, securityRisk 0.75) for Report 1 are justified given the evidence. Benign reports correctly have zero or low scores. Slight adjustment suggested: reduce Report 4's malware score from 0.3 to 0.2 to better reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity despite obfuscation. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described patterns and behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1 indicates moderate suspicion justified by dynamic code execution and obfuscation, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence for suspicion. The current scoring is appropriate, with a minor adjustment to Report 4's malware score for accuracy.",
