  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload silently during package setup. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attack tactics, warranting high malware and risk scores. The obfuscation, stealth, and external comment further support this assessment. Decoding the payload is recommended for confirmation, but the current evidence indicates a significant security threat."
