  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules within a package.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard for modular Python packages.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues, straightforward import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Accurate; no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, slightly lower confidence (1.0 to 0.1 in securityRisk), but the reasoning remains consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The small security risk score is acceptable, considering the minimal nature of the code.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Again, benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning; no issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, benign imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk in import statements, but essentially negligible)\n\nThis thorough review confirms that the code is safe and well-understood.",
