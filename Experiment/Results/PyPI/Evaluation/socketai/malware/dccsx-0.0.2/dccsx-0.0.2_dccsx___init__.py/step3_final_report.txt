  "purpose": "The code imports specific components from local modules within a package, serving to include these modules for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .logo, .logo, .lan_change, .dccsfb",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is a common pattern in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports uniformly recognize the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). The minimal security risk score reflects the standard package structure rather than any actual threat. No modifications to scores are necessary, as all assessments are consistent with the code's benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of import statements from local modules with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code poses no threat.",
