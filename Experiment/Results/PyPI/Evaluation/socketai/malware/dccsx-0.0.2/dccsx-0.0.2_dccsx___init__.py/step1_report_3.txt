  "purpose": "This code imports specific objects from local modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports static components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing 'logo', 'logo2', 'lan_change', and 'dccsfb' from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and typical for organizing package components. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving to organize and include components from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment.",
