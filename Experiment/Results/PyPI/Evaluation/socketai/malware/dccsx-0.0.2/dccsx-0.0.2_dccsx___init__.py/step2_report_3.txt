  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard for organizing Python modules.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The first report assigns a security risk score of 0, confidence of 1, and malware score of 0, which aligns with the assessment that this code is benign.\n- The second report assigns a security risk of 0.1 despite noting no malicious activity, which might be an overestimation unless there's an underlying concern not explicitly detailed.\n- The third, fourth, and fifth reports also assign very low or zero security risk and malware scores, consistent with their analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is purely import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n- The malware score should be 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues in the reports:**\n- The second report's securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high for such straightforward import statements. Unless there's an unmentioned context, this should be 0.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, given the benign nature.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module import pattern with no security concerns. The reports largely agree, but the second report's security risk score could be lowered from 0.1 to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that there is no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
