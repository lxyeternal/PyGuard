  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables from local modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local module files: logo.py, lan_change.py, and dccsfb.py within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from the provided snippet, as it only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; all import statements are standard for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is a typical pattern in Python packages. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns. Since no functions, variables, or runtime data handling are shown, the code appears straightforward and benign. The structure and format are clear and conventional. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module import pattern with no suspicious activity.",
