{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules or objects within the same package, likely for use in the larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .logo, .lan_change, and .dccsfb",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are apparent; no external data or inputs are being processed or transmitted in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present; these are simple import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected; the code is straightforward and typical for module imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four import statements, importing specific objects or modules from local files. There is no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs. Since the code only imports modules, it does not pose an immediate security risk or indicate malicious intent. The structure is simple, and the code appears to be standard practice for organizing Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement block with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports components from the same package, with no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
