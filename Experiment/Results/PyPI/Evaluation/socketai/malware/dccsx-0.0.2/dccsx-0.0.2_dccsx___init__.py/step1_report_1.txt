  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data passing from sources to sinks are visible in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present in this minimal import structure",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific components from local modules. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The imports seem standard for a modular Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward module import statement. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns are detected based on this fragment.",
