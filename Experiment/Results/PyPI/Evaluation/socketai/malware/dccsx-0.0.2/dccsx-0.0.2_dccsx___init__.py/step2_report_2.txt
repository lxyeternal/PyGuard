  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .logo import logo\nfrom .logo import logo2\nfrom .lan_change import lan_change\nfrom .dccsfb import dccsfb\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is purely composed of import statements from local modules.\n- There is no evidence of data flow, network activity, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious behavior.\n- The modules imported are named in a benign manner, suggesting typical application components.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malware:** The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the minimal and benign code.\n\n### Critical review of the scores:\n- The **securityRisk** scores are mostly 0.1, which might be slightly high for such simple import statements, but considering the possibility of hidden malicious modules, a cautious approach is understandable.\n- The **malware** scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the visible code, which is good.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, the scores could be slightly lowered, especially the **securityRisk** to 0, unless there's context suggesting otherwise.\n- The malware score should remain 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in this fragment)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard module import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should reflect this benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- Always consider the context of the entire application; this snippet alone is safe.\n- If future code introduces dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns, re-evaluate accordingly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0",
