  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious obfuscated loader intended to conceal and execute harmful payloads. The high obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution, confirms malicious intent with near certainty. The scores should be set to maximum (malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1) to reflect the severity."
