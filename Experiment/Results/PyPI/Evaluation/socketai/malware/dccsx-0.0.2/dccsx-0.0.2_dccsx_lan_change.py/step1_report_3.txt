  "purpose": "Obfuscated script that decompresses and decodes data, then executes it.",

  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> string reversal -> zlib decompression -> marshal.loads -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through multiple layers of encoding, decoding, and dynamic code execution; no clear purpose or documentation; presence of a large, seemingly random data blob.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules, then performs a sequence of operations: decoding a base64 string, reversing the string, decompressing it with zlib, unmarshaling it with marshal.loads, and executing the result with exec(). The data blob appears to be an encoded payload. The pattern suggests the code is designed to hide its true behavior. Dynamic execution from reconstructed code is inherently suspicious, especially without any visible controls or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding to hide its true purpose. It ultimately executes dynamically reconstructed code, which is a common technique in malicious scripts. Given the lack of transparency and the use of exec() on a decompressed, marshaled payload, this is indicative of malicious intent or at least highly suspicious activity.",
