  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code only reads a local README.md file and passes static metadata and dependencies to `setup()`.\n- Dependencies ('requests', 'bs4') are common and reputable.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the original provided code snippet.\n   - No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero, no justification is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they rely on static analysis.\n   - No overestimations are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python packaging script. It reads a static file and calls `setup()` with predefined, static metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- The scores are appropriate.  \n- No suspicious elements are present.",
