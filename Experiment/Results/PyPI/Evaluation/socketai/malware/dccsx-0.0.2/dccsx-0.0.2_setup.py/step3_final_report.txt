  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'dccsx' module, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading a local README.md file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static metadata and dependencies passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local README.md file for long description, then calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. Dependencies are common packages ('requests', 'bs4'). No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The static nature and standard practices indicate a benign and safe script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns. All evidence supports a zero risk, zero malware, and zero obfuscation assessment.",
