  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dccsx' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, package and dependency definitions in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no input/output with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from source to sink indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. Code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for long description, then defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior observed. The dependencies listed ('requests', 'bs4') are common Python packages. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code follows typical setup.py conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
