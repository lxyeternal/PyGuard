{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'dccsx'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; data is read from a local file and used in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements present. No malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the package description, then calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or other potentially malicious patterns. All dependencies are common Python packages. The structure and content appear typical for a Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
