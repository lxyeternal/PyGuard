{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with dependencies and metadata, but includes potentially malicious code that executes remote scripts and propagates runtime behavior.",
  "sources": "Remote URL requests (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4 and https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode), file read (README.md).",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending data externally), writing files (./{r}.pyw), executing downloaded code via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Requests fetch remote code; the code posts data to an external URL, writes a script file, then executes it; also reads local README.md.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes fetching and executing remote scripts, posting data to pastebin, dynamic filename generation, and running downloaded code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with attempting to import third-party libraries. It then performs malicious actions: sending a POST request to an external URL with a specific message, fetching and saving remote code to a randomly named Python script, and executing that script asynchronously. This behavior indicates possible remote command execution and code injection. The setup process appears normal, but the initial actions are suspicious and potentially malicious, aimed at executing arbitrary code fetched from the internet. The code then reads a local README file and proceeds with standard package setup via setuptools, which appears benign but is overshadowed by preceding malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior, including remote code fetch and execution, as well as data exfiltration. The package setup code is standard but is compromised by the preceding malicious actions. The overall security risk is high due to the active remote code execution and data transfer.",
