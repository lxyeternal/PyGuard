{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with specified metadata and dependencies, and to execute potentially malicious code during import.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs, reading 'README.md', and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs (sending data), executing downloaded code with subprocess, writing files to disk.",
  "flows": "Import requests triggers network requests; requests.post sends data; requests.get downloads code; subprocess.Popen executes downloaded code.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate network activity upon import, executing code fetched from external sources, using random filename for scripts, and potential command injection via subprocess.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing modules and then performs network requests to external sites. It posts data to pastebin.com, fetches code from utilities.tk, saves it to a randomly named .pyw file, and executes it via subprocess. The code reads 'README.md' without any malicious intent. The setup configuration appears normal but is combined with active external communications and code execution. The use of random filenames and executing external code is suspicious, indicating potential malicious behavior such as remote code execution or backdoor setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script actively communicates with external sites, downloads and executes remote code, and uses dynamic filenames, which strongly indicates malicious intent. The package appears to be designed for malicious activity rather than legitimate setup purposes.",
