{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package, but it contains potentially malicious behavior including remote code retrieval and execution.",
  "sources": "Reading remote scripts via requests.get, reading README.md file, importing modules like requests and subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Sending POST requests with data to pastebin, writing and executing a downloaded script, printing exceptions.",
  "flows": "requests.get('https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4') -> requests.post() with the response content; requests.get('https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode') -> writing to a file -> subprocess.Popen() to execute the file; exception handling prints error.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate network activity upon import, downloading and executing code from external sources, writing potentially malicious scripts, using shell=True in subprocess.Popen, attempting to run code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, which is normal. However, it then performs network requests to fetch and send data to external servers. The first request retrieves a script from Pastebin and posts a message with '@everyone' to a pastebin link, indicating potential notification or tracking behavior. It then downloads a script from 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode', saves it to a uniquely named file, and executes it via subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which is highly risky and indicative of malicious activity. Exception handling simply prints errors, offering no safeguards. The setup configuration appears typical but is likely used to conceal or support malicious operations. The code’s overall behavior suggests remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious intent. The use of external code retrieval and immediate execution is suspicious and indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious activity, including remote code fetching and execution, making it highly suspicious and potentially harmful. It appears designed to perform remote control, code injection, or data exfiltration.",
