  "analysis": "The code initiates network requests to external URLs during import, posts data externally, downloads code from a remote server, writes it to a randomly named file, and executes it asynchronously via subprocess with shell=True. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity, including remote code execution and data exfiltration. The code lacks validation or sandboxing, increasing the risk of executing harmful code. The malicious actions are performed during module import, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, security risk ~0.9-1) are consistent with this behavior. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, so obfuscation scores are 0. Overall, the code exhibits clear malicious intent with high severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively fetching and executing remote scripts during import, and exfiltrating data. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. No obfuscation is present. The behavior warrants a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1, indicating a critical threat.",
