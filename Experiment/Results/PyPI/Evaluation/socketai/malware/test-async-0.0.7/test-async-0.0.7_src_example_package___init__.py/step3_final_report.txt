  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network inputs, file reads, user inputs, external domains, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, dynamic code execution points ('eval', 'exec').",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into dynamic execution or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of 'eval'/'exec', hardcoded secrets, suspicious domains/IPs, dynamic code generation, incomplete or suspicious code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious network activity and hardcoded secrets, indicating high malicious potential. Some reports note benign or low-risk code with no suspicious patterns. The most suspicious report (Report 1) shows high obfuscation (0.9), malware likelihood (0.75), and security risk (0.8). Other reports indicate low obfuscation and malware scores, consistent with benign assessments. The overall evidence suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent in the most suspicious code, while others are low risk. The scores are justified based on the described behaviors, with the highest concern centered on Report 1. The combined assessment yields an overall malware score around 0.75, obfuscation around 0.8, and risk around 0.75, reflecting the significant suspicion in the most concerning report and benign nature of others.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the most suspicious code (Report 1) justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, indicating probable malicious intent. Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The overall security posture is moderate, with isolated high-risk indicators. No adjustments to scores are necessary; the assessments are accurate and well-justified.",
