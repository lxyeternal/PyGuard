  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the most suspicious code (Report 1) justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, indicating probable malicious intent. Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The overall security posture is moderate, with isolated high-risk indicators. No adjustments to scores are necessary; the assessments are accurate and well-justified."
