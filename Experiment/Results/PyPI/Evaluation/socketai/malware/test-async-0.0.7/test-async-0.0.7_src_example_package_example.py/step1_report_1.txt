  "purpose": "The function adds one to the provided number, likely used for basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' (potential data source), but no direct data input or external source is evident in this code.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the result, but it does not involve untrusted data sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' is processed and returned after adding 1; no external data flow or untrusted data propagation is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple arithmetic function with no unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function that takes a numeric input and returns the input incremented by one. There are no external data reads, no code injection points, no malicious logic, and no obfuscation. It does not interact with any external systems, environment variables, or perform any side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simple, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a basic utility function with no suspicious elements.",
