  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the output after incrementing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward arithmetic operation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function 'add_one' that takes a parameter 'number' and returns its value incremented by one. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The function is simple and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. It performs basic addition and returns the result. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic arithmetic function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
