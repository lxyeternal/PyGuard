  "purpose": "A simple utility function that adds one to a given number.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' flows directly to the addition operation, then to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function performing addition, with no external dependencies, no side effects, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. It reads input from the function parameter, processes it with a simple arithmetic operation, and returns the result. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
