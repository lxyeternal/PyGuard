{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be absent or minimal, with no concrete evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No code provided; no data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observable.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, limiting analysis. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.2) are consistent with the lack of evidence. The confidence scores are generally appropriate; however, in report 2, a high confidence (0.7) is slightly overstated given no code, and should be lowered to around 0.2-0.3. Overall, the cautious approach is justified, and no significant issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments recommended for confidence levels in report 2. The overall security posture is benign, and no immediate concerns are identified.",
