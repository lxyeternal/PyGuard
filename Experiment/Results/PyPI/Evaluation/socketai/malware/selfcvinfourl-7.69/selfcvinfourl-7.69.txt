      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command during setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity. The pattern of obfuscation, covert execution, and embedded URL warrants a high malware score. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, this package should be treated as potentially malicious and thoroughly reviewed before use."
