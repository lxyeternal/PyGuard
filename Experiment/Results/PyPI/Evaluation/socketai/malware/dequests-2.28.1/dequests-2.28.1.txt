It downloads, executes, and persists arbitrary code from an external server without validation, embedded within HTTP request functions to ensure persistent activation. The behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, warranting classification as malware with maximum severity."

Scores are set accordingly: malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and low security risk (~0.1). Further package source validation is recommended to confirm its legitimacy."
