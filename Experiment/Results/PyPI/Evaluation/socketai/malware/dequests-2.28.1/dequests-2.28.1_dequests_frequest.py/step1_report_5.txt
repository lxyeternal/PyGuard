{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download and execute files based on the operating system, and to wrap various HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, REQUEST) with an execute call that performs the download and execution process.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://35.235.126.33/all.txt' to retrieve the list of executables, and the subsequent requests to URLs constructed from that list to download files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded files via os.system, which can execute arbitrary code or binaries. Also, opening URLs and writing content to files without validation.",
  "flows": "The script fetches a list of executable filenames, downloads each, sets permissions, and executes them. All HTTP request methods invoke execute(), which triggers this process. Data flows from remote server to local file system and then to execution.",
  "anomalies": "The execute() function is called before each HTTP request, causing repeated downloading and execution of potentially malicious files every time a request is made. Hardcoded IP address and URLs are suspicious. Files are executed without validation, and no checks are performed on the downloaded content. Usage of os.system with dynamic filenames is risky. The code downloads and runs arbitrary files based solely on the OS, indicating potential malware behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script first retrieves a list of executable files tailored to the current operating system from a remote server. It then downloads each listed file, sets execution permissions if on Linux or macOS, and executes them in the background. This process is embedded within various HTTP request wrappers, which call execute() before making any network request. This means every time a request method is invoked, the system will download and execute new files from the attacker-controlled server. There are no validation, sandboxing, or integrity checks on these files. The code's structure suggests it is designed for persistent, automated compromise, potentially installing or executing malicious payloads based on the OS. The hardcoded IP and the pattern of downloading and executing arbitrary files are typical of malware behaviors such as remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing arbitrary files from a remote server each time an HTTP request is made, with no validation or security checks. It is highly suspicious and likely intended for malicious activities such as remote control or persistent malware infection.",
