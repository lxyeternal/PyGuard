{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch a list of executable files based on the current operating system, download them from a remote server, set execution permissions, and run them. It also provides wrapper functions for various HTTP request methods that trigger the execution of this download-and-run process before making the requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'http://35.235.126.33/all.txt' to determine which executables to download based on the OS. It also takes input indirectly via the 'url' parameters in HTTP request functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes content fetched from remote servers into files and executes them using system calls like 'os.system'. The 'execute' function runs downloaded executables directly, which could be malicious if the remote server is compromised or malicious.",
  "flows": "The flow starts with fetching a list from the remote server, filtering it based on OS, then downloading each executable and executing it. The HTTP request wrappers call 'execute' before performing network requests, which triggers the download-and-run process every time a request is made.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes files from an external IP address without any validation, which is a significant security concern. The download URL and executable names are hardcoded and not verified, creating a backdoor-like behavior. No validation or checksum verification of downloaded files is present. The functions are designed to trigger malicious actions on any HTTP request made through these wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The script performs active malicious behaviors by fetching executables from an external server, setting execution permissions, and running them without validation or user consent. The code is triggered on every HTTP request via the wrapper functions, enabling continuous or on-demand malicious activity. The remote server address is hardcoded, which indicates intent to control or compromise the host system. This behavior aligns with typical malicious payload execution, constituting a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent by downloading and executing external binaries without validation, and it is designed to run automatically on each HTTP request. This pattern indicates a backdoor or remote code execution setup, posing a severe security threat.",
