  "purpose": "Import HTTP request methods (get, post, put, patch, delete) from the 'frequest' library, likely for making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'frequest' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statement",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'frequest' which may be a typo or a maliciously named package, as it resembles 'requests' but is misspelled. No other anomalies in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a module named 'frequest'. The module name is suspiciously similar to 'requests', a common HTTP library, but misspelled. Without additional context, it is unclear if 'frequest' is legitimate or malicious. The snippet alone contains no actual execution or data handling, so no malicious activity can be confirmed. The import statement itself is benign but warrants further investigation into the 'frequest' package to ensure it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports functions from a module named 'frequest'. The module name is suspiciously similar to 'requests' but is misspelled, which could indicate malicious intent or simply a typo. No malicious activity is evident from this snippet alone, but the module should be verified for legitimacy to rule out malicious behavior.",
