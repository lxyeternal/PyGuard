{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project called 'dequests'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution points; uses standard packaging methods.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file, then passes metadata and dependencies to the setup() function for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. Package data and dependencies appear normal.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for packaging. It uses standard libraries and conventions without any unusual patterns or suspicious code. No network connections, data leaks, or code injection mechanisms are present. The use of package data and setup parameters follow typical practices for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious code. It primarily handles packaging metadata and dependencies with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
