{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'dequests' Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; configuration parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual 'package_dir' mapping ('requests' to 'requests') which may be a typo or misconfiguration but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious payloads. The only anomaly is the 'package_dir' mapping, which appears benign or a minor misconfiguration. All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and intended for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The minor 'package_dir' anomaly does not indicate malicious intent. The overall assessment confirms no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
