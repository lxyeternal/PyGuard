{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing the 'dequests' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; reading package metadata from variables; defining dependencies and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code reads untrusted data at runtime; setup parameters and dependencies are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; package data and metadata are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No input/output handling of untrusted data occurs at runtime. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dependencies listed are common and related to HTTP request handling, aligned with the package purpose. The code structure and content are typical for a setup script and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a normal package setup configuration with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters in a standard manner.",
