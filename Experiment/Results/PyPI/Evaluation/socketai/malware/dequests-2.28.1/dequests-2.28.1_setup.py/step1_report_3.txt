  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'dequests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing modules, defining metadata variables, specifying dependencies, configuring setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no network or system commands executed; no environment variable manipulations observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> setting package metadata and dependencies -> configuring setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Package data paths and dependencies are standard; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, reading a README file for description, defining package metadata and dependencies, and configuring the setup() function. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, implementing typical package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
