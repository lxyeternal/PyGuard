      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally, indicating malicious intent. The setup process is benign, but the embedded payload warrants high concern. The malware score is justified at 0.85, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 0.85. This package should be treated as potentially malicious and further analyzed or avoided."
