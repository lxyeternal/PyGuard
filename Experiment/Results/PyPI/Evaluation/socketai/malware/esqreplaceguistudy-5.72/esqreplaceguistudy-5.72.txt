      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple signs of malicious activity, including obfuscated PowerShell execution, silent error handling, and suspicious URL references. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as potentially malicious, and further analysis of the PowerShell payload is recommended before any use or distribution."
