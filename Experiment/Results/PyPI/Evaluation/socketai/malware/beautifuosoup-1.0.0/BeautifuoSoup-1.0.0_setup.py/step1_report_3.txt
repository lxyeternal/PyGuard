{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install command that executes encrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes encrypted payloads within the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via 'exec()' which can run arbitrary code, potentially malicious, on the target system.",
  "flows": "The custom install command decrypts data using Fernet and executes it with 'exec()', creating a source-to-sink flow from encrypted data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of encrypted payload and the execution of decrypted code is suspicious. The long, obfuscated description and random class name add to the concern. The use of 'exec()' on decrypted data is a major anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package setup with metadata and a custom installation class that overrides 'run()'. Inside 'run()', if the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes the resulting code via 'exec()'. The use of encrypted code combined with 'exec()' is a typical pattern for hiding malicious payloads. The code appears designed to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The package name 'BeautifuoSoup' is similar to 'BeautifulSoup', possibly a spoof. The long description appears to be random gibberish, and the class name is nonsensical. These all suggest obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden payload executed during installation, likely malicious. The use of encryption and dynamic execution points to an attempt to hide malicious behavior. Overall, this package appears unsafe due to the encrypted payload and code execution during install.",
