{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that appears to be intentionally obfuscated, likely designed to install dependencies and execute hidden code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string data for the Fernet key and encrypted payload; imports modules 'os', 'requests', and 'fernet'; reads environment info via os.name; and calls exec() on decrypted data.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which is highly suspicious; it can lead to arbitrary code execution, backdoors, or malware installation.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts a payload with Fernet, then executes it directly via exec(), creating a direct source-to-sink path from hardcoded data to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated strings in description and long_description; a class with a non-standard name executing decryption and exec; use of hardcoded cryptographic keys; execution of decrypted code during installation; setup_requires with 'fernet' and 'requests' (which may be used for network activity).",
  "analysis": "The setup script is designed to run during package installation. It contains obfuscated and intentionally complex naming to conceal malicious intent. During installation, on Windows systems, it decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity or backdoor behavior. The code's obfuscation, combined with execution of decrypted code, suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized actions. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data is a critical security risk, possibly allowing remote or embedded malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits highly suspicious behavior typical of malicious package dependencies: obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and runtime code execution. The package should be considered dangerous and should not be used or trusted.",
