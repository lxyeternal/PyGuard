{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that, on Windows systems, decrypts a hardcoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), imports modules (requests, fernet), and uses hardcoded encrypted payload and key.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, leading to potential system compromise.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) → import modules → decrypt payload with hardcoded key → execute decrypted code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class name, long nonsensical description strings, embedded encrypted payload, hardcoded cryptographic key, code execution during package install, conditional on Windows OS.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscation and runtime decryption to conceal malicious payloads. It decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code during installation on Windows. This pattern is characteristic of malicious supply chain components or backdoors. The obfuscation, embedded secrets, and runtime execution of arbitrary code pose a significant security threat. The high malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by these behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious, potentially malicious code designed to execute arbitrary payloads during installation, representing a severe security risk. It should be considered malicious and avoided.",
