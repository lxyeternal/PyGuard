{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'BeautifuoSoup' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name check, imported modules (requests, fernet), embedded encrypted string and decryption key, exec() call with decrypted code",
  "sinks": "exec() execution of decrypted code, potentially executing malicious code obtained from the decryption process",
  "flows": "If os.name == 'nt', import requests and fernet, decrypt embedded payload, and execute it via exec() during installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded decryption key and encrypted payload, execution of decrypted code via exec(), obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted payload and decryption key embedded directly in code",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package. It contains a class with a run method that, on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key, and executes the resulting code with exec(). This behavior indicates dynamic code execution with embedded, concealed code, which is suspicious. The decryption and execution happen during package installation, potentially allowing malicious code to run on the user's system without transparency. The use of encrypted payload and decryption key strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent or functionality. The package name and other metadata appear benign or intentionally obfuscated, but the core logic is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing hidden code during installation, which poses a security risk. The encrypted payload and hardcoded key imply an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The overall security risk is high due to dynamic code execution based on embedded encrypted data.",
