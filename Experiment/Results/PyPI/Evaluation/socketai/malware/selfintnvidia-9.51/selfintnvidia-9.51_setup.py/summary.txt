  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered conditionally. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, warranting further investigation or removal. The high malware (0.85), obfuscated (0.8), and risk (0.9) scores are justified by the evidence."
