{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python package installation process to execute a network request and save an image file upon completion of installation.",
  "sources": "socket.getfqdn() for generating dynamic URL parameter, urllib.request.urlopen() for fetching remote data during post-installation.",
  "sinks": "open(destination, 'wb') writes data fetched from the network to a local file 'image.png'.",
  "flows": "socket.getfqdn() → base64 encoding → URL construction → urllib.request.urlopen() → response.read() → open() to write data to local file.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs a URL with system information and fetches remote content during install, which is unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials, but the network request is suspicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a post-installation hook that retrieves the fully qualified domain name of the system, encodes it, and appends it as a query parameter to a URL hosted on Heroku. It then downloads the content at this URL and saves it locally as 'image.png'. This process is registered to run at the end of the package installation, which could be used for tracking or retrieving remote content without user consent. The network activity occurs during the package install phase, which is unusual and potentially malicious, especially given the dynamic URL construction and data retrieval. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs like reverse shells or data exfiltration, but the behavior raises security concerns due to user tracking or malicious remote content fetching.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an external network request during package installation, dynamically generating a URL with system information. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious purposes, constituting a security risk. No explicit malware signatures are present, but the suspicious network activity warrants caution.",
