  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by silently transmitting system information to an external server during package installation, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. While no explicit malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior warrants caution. The overall malware likelihood is moderate (~0.4-0.5), and the security risk is high (~0.65-0.75). It should be reviewed further, especially regarding the remote URL's purpose."
