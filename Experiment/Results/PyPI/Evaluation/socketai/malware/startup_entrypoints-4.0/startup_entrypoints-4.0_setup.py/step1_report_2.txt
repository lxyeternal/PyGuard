{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python package installation process to execute a network request upon installation, saving an image file locally.",
  "sources": "The code reads the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host system using socket.getfqdn().",
  "sinks": "The code performs a network request to a URL constructed with the encoded FQDN, and writes data to a local file named 'image.png'.",
  "flows": "The source (FQDN) is encoded and appended as a URL parameter, then used to fetch data from a remote server, which is saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically constructs a URL using system information and automatically fetches data during package installation without user consent. The URL points to an external server, and the fetched data is saved directly to disk without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process via a custom install command. When the package is installed, it registers a function to execute at program exit, which retrieves the system's FQDN, encodes it in base64, and appends it as a parameter to a remote URL. It then fetches the data from this URL and saves it as 'image.png' in the current directory. This behavior could be used for tracking or data exfiltration, especially since it silently executes during install without user awareness. The URL points to a potentially malicious or at least suspicious server, and the code’s design appears to facilitate remote communication based on system info. Overall, this constitutes potentially malicious behavior, as it collects system information and contacts an external server without explicit user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains behavior indicative of tracking or data exfiltration by sending system info to an external server during package installation. It operates stealthily and writes data locally without validation, representing a security concern. This pattern suggests malicious intent or at least a privacy violation.",
