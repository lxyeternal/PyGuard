  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command stealthily during package setup. The presence of a suspicious domain, encoded command, and silent error handling strongly suggest malicious activity, such as backdoor installation or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; I recommend treating this package as malicious and removing it from distribution until further decoding and verification of the command."
