      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with suspicious URL comments and silent error handling. These behaviors are highly indicative of malicious activity, warranting high security concern. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms safety."
