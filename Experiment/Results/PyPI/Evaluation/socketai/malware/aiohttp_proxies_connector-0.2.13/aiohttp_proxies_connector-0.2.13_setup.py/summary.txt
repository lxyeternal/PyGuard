  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 1,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution of embedded scripts that contain network and system manipulation functions. These behaviors are characteristic of malware loaders or backdoors. Given the heavy encoding, lack of validation, and embedded network/system functions, the script is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The malware score is set to 1.0, obfuscation at 0.9, and overall security risk at 1.0, reflecting the critical threat posed by this code."
