  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers supporting connection, negotiation, and optional authentication for asynchronous socket communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket connections, hostnames for address resolution, and user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Sends and receives data over network sockets, including proxy negotiation and authentication data, potentially affecting network security if misused.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution and authentication steps, then to proxy negotiation, and finally to establishing a proxied connection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and adheres to standard protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client logic with proper error handling, optional authentication, and address resolution. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of standard libraries and clear structure indicates no obfuscation or hidden features. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
