  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scoring, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states no suspicious or malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard proxy protocol handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** Given the code's straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious behavior, these scores seem appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score than Report 1, but still consistent given the code's purpose and lack of malicious indicators.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious flows.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous reports; the code remains a standard SOCKS proxy client implementation.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The code's purpose and implementation are standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or covert channels are evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable considering the code's function—proxy handling can be a security concern if misused, but the code itself appears safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **No signs of malware:** The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers, with no suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious logic.  \n- **Scores are consistent:** The assigned scores reflect the code's nature accurately.  \n- **Potential concerns:** Only if the code were embedded in a larger, malicious context or had hidden features, but based solely on this code, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (matching the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no evident security risks or malicious features.",
