{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for network communication, including connection negotiation and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostname and port parameters for destination addresses, and potentially user credentials for authentication. Data is read from network sockets during negotiation and data exchange.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include socket send/receive operations, especially where untrusted data (hostnames, credentials) are processed or transmitted. Notably, socket communication is performed directly with provided inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (hostnames, ports, credentials) through address resolution and authentication routines, then via socket connect and negotiate methods, with data being sent and received over network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears to follow standard asynchronous socket programming patterns and proxy negotiation procedures. No suspicious network behaviors or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers, supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with authentication and address resolution. The functions resolve hostnames, handle connection setup, and manage proxy negotiations asynchronously. All data handling and network operations align with typical proxy client behavior. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code does not contain hidden network communications or covert channels. It is purely functional for establishing proxy connections in an asynchronous environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers without any evident malicious intent. It handles network connection setup and proxy negotiation securely following protocol standards. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears safe for use in network applications.",
