{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, handling connection, negotiation, and address resolution to facilitate proxy-based network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads include user inputs like hostnames, ports, and optional credentials; socket address resolution via getaddrinfo; and data received from proxy servers during negotiation.",
  "sinks": "Data sent includes connection requests, authentication data, and address info; data received includes server responses, address info, and error codes. Sockets are used for network communication.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hostnames and credentials flow into address resolution and authentication procedures; data flows from inputs into socket send/recv operations; proxy negotiation responses determine subsequent actions; all data exchanges occur via socket send and receive methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic string encoding and socket address handling, which are standard for network code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. No suspicious obfuscated code or hidden logic present. The code handles exceptions properly during network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, with proper handling of socket connections, address resolution, and proxy negotiation. It includes comprehensive error handling for socket and protocol errors, but no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. No suspicious or obfuscated code segments are present. The code's purpose aligns with proxy functionality without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in the provided code segment.",
