  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, reasoning, scores, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer states that the code is a standard SOCKS proxy implementation with no malicious or suspicious activity. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1).\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Well-founded, based on the code's straightforward proxy negotiation functions, proper error handling, and absence of obfuscation or secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; the report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes standard implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is 0.95, malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Consistent with the code's structure and purpose.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, describes a standard SOCKS proxy client, with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correct, based on the code's functions and flow.\n\n- **Scores:** Reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirming standard implementation, no malicious behavior, low security risk.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Consistent.\n\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also finds the code legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity, proper error handling, and standard protocol adherence.\n\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Valid.\n\n- **Scores:** Suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- The security risks are low, reflecting the code's nature.\n\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating that the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior.\n\n- The logic and data flows are transparent and aligned with standard SOCKS proxy implementations.\n\n- No evidence suggests malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, given the nature of the code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no security issues or malware risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores are justified and should remain low.\n- Overall, the code is safe for use in network applications.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores; no adjustments needed.",
