  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers for asynchronous socket communication.\n- Handles connection, negotiation, authentication, and address resolution.\n- Uses standard Python libraries, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n- Error handling appears appropriate and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard SOCKS proxy wrappers.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a typical implementation, with no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The low security risk score is reasonable given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis finds no malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) seems justified given the potential for credential handling, but nothing malicious is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy wrappers with optional authentication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No signs of malicious activity. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers, supporting authentication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis confirms the code's legitimacy. The risk score is low, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy wrappers with address resolution and negotiation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report states that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, which is justified.\n- Risk scores vary slightly (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the handling of credentials and network operations.\n- Confidence levels are high, and obfuscation is consistently 0.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or obfuscated features.\n- The handling of credentials is optional and not hardcoded.\n- The network interactions are standard for proxy implementations.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious command execution.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to credential handling, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with my assessment. The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No changes are necessary to the scores or reasoning. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.",
