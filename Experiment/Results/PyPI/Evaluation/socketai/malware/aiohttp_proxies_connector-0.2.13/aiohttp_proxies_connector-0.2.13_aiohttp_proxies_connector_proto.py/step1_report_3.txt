{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous SOCKS proxy client wrappers (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for network connections, enabling connections through a proxy server with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and hostnames for destination and proxy; network address resolution occurs via getaddrinfo; socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; and protocol-specific request/response handling.",
  "sinks": "The code sends proxy negotiation and authentication data over network sockets; it receives responses from the proxy server; socket data is transmitted via sock_sendall and sock_recv; potentially untrusted data could be processed if provided as hostnames or user credentials.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, credentials) flow into socket address resolution and protocol request construction; these requests are sent to the proxy server; responses are received and processed to establish a connection to the target host; socket data is transmitted and received between client and proxy, then from proxy to target.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The code uses standard libraries and protocols; no obfuscation or unusual code constructs are evident. The use of domain encoding/decoding and address resolution is standard. The error handling appears appropriate, and no hidden or backdoor behaviors are detected. The code performs expected proxy connection negotiations without suspicious deviations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connection wrappers using asyncio for non-blocking socket operations. It performs address resolution, constructs protocol-specific negotiation messages, handles responses, and manages socket lifecycle correctly. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or hidden behaviors are present. It adheres to typical proxy protocol procedures, with appropriate error handling and support for DNS resolution strategies. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy connection wrappers for asyncio, with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected proxy negotiation and connection tasks securely and transparently. No indicators of malware or security risks are present based on this review.",
