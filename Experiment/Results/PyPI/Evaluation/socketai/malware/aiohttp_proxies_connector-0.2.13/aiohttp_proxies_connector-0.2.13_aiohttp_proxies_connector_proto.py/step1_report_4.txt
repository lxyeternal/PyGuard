{
  "purpose": "This code provides an implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers for asynchronous socket communication, enabling connections through proxies with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include hostnames, ports, optional user credentials, and DNS resolution results. Data is read from network sockets during negotiation, authentication, and address retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over sockets for proxy negotiation, authentication, and connection establishment. Data received from proxies is processed for responses and address information.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves resolving host addresses, establishing a socket connection to the proxy, negotiating SOCKS protocol handshakes, optional authentication, sending connect requests, and reading responses, ultimately creating a tunnel to the target destination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code adheres to standard SOCKS protocol implementations with no signs of obfuscation or malicious modifications. Usage of exceptions and network operations appears standard and secure. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy protocols in an asynchronous context. It includes functions for address resolution, connection establishment, SOCKS handshake, and optional authentication. Error handling is appropriate for network errors and SOCKS protocol responses. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are observed. The logic follows standard proxy implementation patterns. The code operates with explicit variables, straightforward control flow, and no dynamic or obfuscated code execution. No external data leaks or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers for asyncio-based Python applications. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It performs legitimate network proxy operations securely. Overall security risk is very low.",
