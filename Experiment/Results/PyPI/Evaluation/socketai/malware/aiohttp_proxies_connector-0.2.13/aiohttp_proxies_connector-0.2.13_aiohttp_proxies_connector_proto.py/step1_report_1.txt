{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connection, negotiation, and data transfer through proxies, primarily for network communication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket connections via sock_recv and sock_sendall methods, address resolution via getaddrinfo, and user inputs such as host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to sockets for network communication, potentially transmitting user credentials and proxy commands. Receives data from network responses, including proxy handshake replies and address information.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials) flows into address resolution and authentication routines; proxy negotiation data flows from client to proxy and back; network responses flow into response handling functions to determine success or failure of connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code performs standard network and proxy handshake procedures. No unusual or obfuscated code features are detected. Error handling is straightforward, and no network traffic is sent without proper socket communication. The code does not contain any hidden or malicious commands, backdoors, or system disruptions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It uses standard Python libraries and idioms for asynchronous socket operations. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious data flows or suspicious data handling methods are present. The functions perform expected tasks like address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoor mechanisms. All network interactions are explicitly part of the proxy negotiation process, which is standard for such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical proxy negotiation and connection functions without any hidden or malicious behaviors. It is safe for use from a security standpoint based on this analysis.",
