  "purpose": "Implement a proxy connector supporting various proxy types with optional DNS resolution control and dynamic URL generation for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Proxy configuration parameters (host, port, username, password), external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), socket connection establishment.",
  "sinks": "Socket creation, URL formation, network connection initiation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy details) are used to generate proxy URL and socket connections; socket wrapper manages connection to target host through proxy.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with dynamic URL creation and socket wrapping. External helper functions are assumed safe. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code handles proxy credentials securely in URL format, and the connection logic is standard. External functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) are critical but assumed benign based on context. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The overall security posture is low risk, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard proxy connector implementation with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The current low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given the functionality. External helper functions should be verified separately, but based on provided information, the code is safe.",
