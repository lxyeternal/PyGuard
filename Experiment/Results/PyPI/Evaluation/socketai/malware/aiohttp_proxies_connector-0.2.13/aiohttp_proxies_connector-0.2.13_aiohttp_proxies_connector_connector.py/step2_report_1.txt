  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, standard proxy handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which appears to be a straightforward implementation of a proxy connector. The low risk score is justified given the absence of suspicious patterns. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1—standard proxy connector, no malicious activity, dynamic URL creation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code handles proxy configurations safely, with no signs of malicious intent. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection classes, no hardcoded secrets, standard practices, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears legitimate and safe. The low risk score is justified, and malware is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection logic, no hardcoded secrets, standard URL and socket handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's behavior is typical for proxy management, with no suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Proxy connection classes, standard handling, no malicious patterns, inputs are used appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports consistently find no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The scores for malware are uniformly zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting typical proxy handling with minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—proxy handling with dynamic URL creation and socket wrapping—there's a minimal security risk. The scores assigned (0.1-0.2) seem reasonable, considering the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The code appears legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is low. The scoring aligns well with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.",
