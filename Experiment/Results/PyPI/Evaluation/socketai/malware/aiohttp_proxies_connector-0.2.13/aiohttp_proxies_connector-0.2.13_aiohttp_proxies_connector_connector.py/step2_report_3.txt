  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or covert channels.\n- The code relies on external functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) which are assumed to be standard or safe.\n- Proxy URL construction and socket handling are parameterized and follow typical patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; potential network sinks are socket creation and URL formation.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2`, `confidence=0.9`.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. The low security risk score seems reasonable, given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy configuration handling.\n- No suspicious logic or malicious behavior.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Focuses on the code's structure and the use of external helpers.\n- No signs of backdoors or malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion matches the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Highlights the proxy connection logic, socket wrapping, and URL formation.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment seems justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Emphasizes the standard pattern of proxy handling, no suspicious code.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None apparent; all are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The low risk scores are justified because the code is a typical proxy connector without malicious intent.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code handles user input for proxy URLs and credentials but does not show insecure handling beyond standard practices, which are acceptable here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential misconfiguration or external helper vulnerabilities, but nothing in the code suggests actual risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code does not pose security concerns based on the provided snippets. The overall risk is minimal, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
