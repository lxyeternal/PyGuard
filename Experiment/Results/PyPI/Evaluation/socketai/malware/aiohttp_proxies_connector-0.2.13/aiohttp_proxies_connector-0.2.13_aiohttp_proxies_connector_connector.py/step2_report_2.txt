  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described findings, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code appears to be a typical implementation of a proxy connector for aiohttp, with support for various proxy types, custom DNS resolution, and dynamic URL construction.\n- The functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are external helpers; their implementation is not shown but are described as standard and parameterized.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The logic flows—building proxy URLs, wrapping sockets, establishing connections—are consistent with legitimate proxy handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** No issues are apparent; the code seems syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risks:** The overall security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the provided code, no exploitable vulnerabilities or assumptions are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Score:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- *Assessment:* Accurate; no malicious behavior, standard proxy handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Score:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- *Assessment:* Correct; no suspicious activity, legitimate configuration.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Score:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9\n- *Assessment:* Appropriate; no anomalies, standard implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Score:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9\n- *Assessment:* Valid; typical proxy connection code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Score:* Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- *Assessment:* Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1-0.2** — appropriate given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The external functions `create_socket_wrapper` and `parse_proxy_url` are critical. If they contain vulnerabilities or malicious code, that could impact the overall security posture. However, based on the reports, they are assumed to be standard and safe.\n- The code does not handle sensitive data insecurely; proxy credentials are included in URLs but are standard practice.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n## **Final verdict:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | **0**       |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**       |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1**     |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis. The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
