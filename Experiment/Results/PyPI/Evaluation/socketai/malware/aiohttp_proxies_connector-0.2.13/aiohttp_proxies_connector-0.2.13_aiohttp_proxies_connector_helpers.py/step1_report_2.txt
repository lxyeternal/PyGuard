{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers for different proxy types.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as 'socks_url', 'host', 'port', and environment variables indirectly through imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket connections and asyncio event loop methods to establish network connections. No direct data sinks or untrusted output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'socks_url', 'host', 'port') flow into 'parse_proxy_url' and 'create_socket_wrapper', then into 'sock.connect()', and finally to 'asyncio.open_connection' or 'loop.create_connection'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious string manipulations, or unusual code structures. Uses external modules for proxy handling; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for establishing proxy connections, parsing URLs, and creating socket wrappers. It correctly handles input validation for host and port. Proxy URL parsing uses 'urllib.parse.unquote' but safely defaults to empty strings if user info is missing. The connection functions correctly handle optional parameters, use asyncio's event loop, and ensure only SOCKS proxies are used. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No suspicious network activity beyond intended proxy connection setup. The code appears legitimate, focusing solely on establishing network connections via proxies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for proxy-based asynchronous network connections without any malicious intent or security issues. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
