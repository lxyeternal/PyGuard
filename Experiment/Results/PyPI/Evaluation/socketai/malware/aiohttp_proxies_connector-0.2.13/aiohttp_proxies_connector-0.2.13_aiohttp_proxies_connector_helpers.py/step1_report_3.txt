{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for creating network connections through SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads proxy URL input in parse_proxy_url, input parameters for connection functions (host, port, socks_url, credentials).",
  "sinks": "Uses the created socket for network connection via asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection, which can potentially send or receive data.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL is parsed into credentials and proxy type, then used to create a socket wrapper. The socket connects to the target host and port, then data flow occurs through asyncio connection methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. Proxy credentials are obtained from URL or parameters, but they are handled securely without storage or exfiltration. No suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse proxy URLs, create socket wrappers based on proxy type, and establish network connections asynchronously via proxies. Proxy URL parsing extracts host, port, username, and password, which are then used in socket creation. The socket wrappers support SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies only. The code correctly handles input validation, uses standard asyncio and socket libraries, and does not contain code injection or data leakage mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate network utility with proper input validation and secure handling of credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for connecting through SOCKS proxies using asyncio. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Its purpose appears to be legitimate network connectivity facilitation without security risks.",
