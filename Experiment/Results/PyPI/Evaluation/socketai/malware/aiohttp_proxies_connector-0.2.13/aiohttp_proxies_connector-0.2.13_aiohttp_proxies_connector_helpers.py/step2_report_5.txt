  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Purpose: Establish network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5).\n- Functionality: Parse proxy URLs, create socket wrappers, connect asynchronously.\n- Behavior: No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard library usage, no suspicious code patterns.\n- Potential risks: Proxy URL parsing relies on external input; no validation beyond basic parsing, but this is typical.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes proxy connection setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate given the code's purpose. The security risk is minimal, mainly due to reliance on external proxy URLs, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or behavior; legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The high confidence aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard proxy connection code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is consistent, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to reliance on external proxy URLs, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low, typical for proxy connection code)\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- Proxy URL parsing is straightforward and does not introduce significant security concerns.\n- The code's security profile is consistent with its intended functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is a standard, legitimate utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections with no malicious intent or behavior.",
