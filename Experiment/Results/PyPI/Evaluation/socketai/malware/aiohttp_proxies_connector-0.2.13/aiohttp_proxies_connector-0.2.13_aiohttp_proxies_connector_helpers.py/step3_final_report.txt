  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5), including URL parsing, socket wrapper creation, and asynchronous connection setup.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input in 'socks_url', parameters 'host' and 'port', environment variables for asyncio event loop.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url processes 'socks_url' to extract proxy details -> create_socket_wrapper initializes socket -> connect() establishes connection -> open_connection or create_connection uses socket to establish final connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Proxy URL parsing defaults to empty strings if user info is missing, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for connecting through SOCKS proxies, with proper validation of inputs, safe URL parsing, and use of standard libraries. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The potential security concern is reliance on external proxy URLs, which could be exploited if malicious URLs are supplied, but this is typical in proxy configuration code and not indicative of malicious intent. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and typical usage risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections. It contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risk, primarily related to untrusted proxy URLs, which is a standard concern rather than a code flaw.",
