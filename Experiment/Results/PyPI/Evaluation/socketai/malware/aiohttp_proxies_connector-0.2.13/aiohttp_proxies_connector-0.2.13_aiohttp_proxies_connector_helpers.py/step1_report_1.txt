  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create network connections through SOCKS proxies, either by opening a socket connection or a full protocol connection, with support for proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL (parse_proxy_url), user input parameters (socks_url, host, port), environment variables indirectly via asyncio.get_event_loop()",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection, socket connection, socket wrapper connect method",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details from URL -> create_socket_wrapper creates proxy socket -> connect() establishes proxy connection -> open_connection or create_connection proceed to open actual network connection through proxy",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior. Use of external libraries appears standard; no data leaks or secret exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully handles proxy URL parsing, converting URL components into proxy parameters, then creating appropriate SOCKS socket wrappers. The connection functions validate inputs, obtain event loop, parse proxy URL if provided, and establish connections via SOCKS proxies. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, system modifications, or suspicious network activities. External library usage appears standard and non-malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are detected. The main focus is on establishing network connections through proxies with configurable parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for legitimate purposes: establishing proxied network connections. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It functions as a proxy connector utility. Overall security risk is very low.",
