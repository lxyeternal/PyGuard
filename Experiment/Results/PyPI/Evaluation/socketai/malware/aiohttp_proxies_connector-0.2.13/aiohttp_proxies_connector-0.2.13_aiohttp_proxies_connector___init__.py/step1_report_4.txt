{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a proxy handling library, providing classes, error definitions, helpers, and types related to proxy connections.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; imports modules and functions from local files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data processing or transmission functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports components from local modules, defines a version string, and sets up the __all__ list for exports. It does not process input, perform network operations, or handle untrusted data. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module interface file. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization or interface setup for a proxy library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is benign and intended for organizing exports.",
