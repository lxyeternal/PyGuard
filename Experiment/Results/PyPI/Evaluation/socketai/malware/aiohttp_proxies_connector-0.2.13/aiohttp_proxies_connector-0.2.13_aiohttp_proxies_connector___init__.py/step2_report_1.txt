  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard module initializer (__init__.py style) for a Python package related to proxy handling.\n- No report finds any suspicious behavior, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- The code's purpose is purely to import and export classes, functions, and constants; it does not perform any runtime logic or data handling.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The code matches the description in each report: it is a straightforward package setup file.\n- There are no errors, flaws, or mistakes in the logic or reasoning within the reports.\n- The reports' scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is only an import/export setup, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious intent is apparent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Any adjustments?**\n- None needed. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a standard, harmless module initializer with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
