  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a typical Python package `__init__.py` file that imports classes, functions, error types, and constants from local modules and defines the public API via `__all__`. It also specifies a version string. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module initializer with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports consistently recognize that the code is standard package setup code with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or security issues.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No external code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.  \n  **Score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used.  \n  **Score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The code is a standard module setup with no vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or insecure patterns.  \n  **Score should remain 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured module initializer for a proxy handling library, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No changes to their assessments are necessary.",
