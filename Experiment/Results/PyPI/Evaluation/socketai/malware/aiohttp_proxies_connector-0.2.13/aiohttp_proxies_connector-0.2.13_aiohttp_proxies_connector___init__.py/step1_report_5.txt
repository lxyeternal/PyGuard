{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for handling proxy connections, likely for network communication or anonymity purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data transmissions are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable within this fragment; it mainly imports and defines package exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The version string is a typical package version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from internal modules related to proxy connections and errors, then defines the package's version and exports. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py file, setting up module exports. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are identifiable from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer for a proxy handling library. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It solely sets up imports and exports for the package.",
