{
  "purpose": "Module initializer for a proxy handling Python package, importing classes, errors, helpers, and constants for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static import and export of symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py style module that imports classes, error types, helper functions, and constants, then defines __version__ and __all__ for public API. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
