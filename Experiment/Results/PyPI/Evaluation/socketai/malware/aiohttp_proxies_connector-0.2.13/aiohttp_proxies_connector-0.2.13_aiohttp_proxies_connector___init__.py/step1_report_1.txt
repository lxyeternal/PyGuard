{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index or module initializer for a Python package related to SOCKS proxy connections, importing classes, errors, and helper functions for proxy handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code mainly imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed; code structure is standard for a Python package __init__.py file",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules and defines an export list. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The presence of versioning and the __all__ list indicates typical package setup code. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues was found. It appears to be a straightforward module initializer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no suspicious or malicious content. It only imports and exports components, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
