{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for a proxy connection library, defining imports, version, and exports for proxy handling and errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and version declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The module imports dependencies and exposes functions and classes, but does not process input or data flow directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network or file system operations, no data leakage or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components related to proxy handling and error management, assigns a version string, and specifies what symbols to export. It functions as a typical module initializer or public API definition, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no code injection, backdoors, or malicious code structures present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy handling library. It contains no malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. No anomalies or malware signals are detected.",
