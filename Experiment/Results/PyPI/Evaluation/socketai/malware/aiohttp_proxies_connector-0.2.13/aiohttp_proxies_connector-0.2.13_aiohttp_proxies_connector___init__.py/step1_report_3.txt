{
  "purpose": "This module appears to facilitate establishing proxy connections, likely related to SOCKS proxies, by importing various classes, error types, and helper functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, and .proto; these are internal and not sources of external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no data is being sent or received within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code only imports components and defines metadata; there are no data flows, input/output, or external interactions in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code solely imports specific classes, functions, and error types from internal modules, and defines the module's version and export list. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious module setup for a proxy-related library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate package related to proxy connections.",
