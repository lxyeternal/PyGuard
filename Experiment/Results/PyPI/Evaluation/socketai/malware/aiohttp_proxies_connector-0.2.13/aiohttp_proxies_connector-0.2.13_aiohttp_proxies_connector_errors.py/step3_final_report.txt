  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors for error handling in network applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inherit from standard exception classes; no data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or control flows; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward and purely definitional.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from base exception classes. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static, simple, and standard for error handling, with no embedded or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The exception classes serve as error indicators for SOCKS proxy operations and do not perform any operations themselves.",
