{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data processing or I/O present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are merely definitions without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, no data handling, or operations that could be exploited. This appears to be a straightforward, static set of exception definitions with no malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
