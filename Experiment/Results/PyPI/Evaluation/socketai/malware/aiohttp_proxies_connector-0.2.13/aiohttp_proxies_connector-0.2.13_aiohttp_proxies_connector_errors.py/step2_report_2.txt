  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code only defines a set of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n   - No functions, data processing, or execution logic.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or embedded malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly states that there is no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk, and the code is straightforward class definitions, there is no justification for high risk scores.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 for all categories.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, code execution, or data leaks.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations: the code only defines exception classes.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scoring are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and typical for error handling in a larger application. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
