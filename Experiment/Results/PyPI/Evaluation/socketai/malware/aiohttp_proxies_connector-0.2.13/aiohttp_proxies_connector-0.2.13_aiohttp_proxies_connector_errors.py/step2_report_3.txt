  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- They uniformly state there are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious code.\n- The code is straightforward, inheriting from standard exceptions, with no embedded logic or obfuscation.\n\n**Confirming the code's presence of issues:**\n- The code is consistent across all reports; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n**Analysis of scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty based on the static, straightforward code.\n\n**Potential points of critique or adjustments:**\n- Since the code is only class definitions, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify this as a benign utility code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are claimed or implied.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The scores given are appropriate and consistent.\n- The code itself poses no security risk or malware threat.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
