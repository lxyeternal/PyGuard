  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- There are no data sources, sinks, or control flows.\n- No operational logic, data processing, or network interactions are present.\n- The classes inherit from standard exception types, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issue Presence:\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the descriptions in all reports. It only defines exception classes with no operational code.\n- **Malicious code or malware:** None detected; the malware score should be 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; obfuscated code would involve hidden or confusing constructs, which are absent.\n- **Security risk:** Given the benign nature, the security risk score should be 0.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior or code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- All reports assign a malware, obfuscated, and risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here, as the code is purely structural.\n- No reason to adjust scores or challenge claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, my assessment aligns with the existing scores.**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.**",
