{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS and proxy-related errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. All classes are standard custom exceptions with no embedded logic or data.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS and proxy errors, which are standard and do not perform any operations or contain malicious code. No data reading, processing, or network interactions are present. There are no anomalies, obfuscations, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward set of class definitions for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, establishing custom exception classes for SOCKS and proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
