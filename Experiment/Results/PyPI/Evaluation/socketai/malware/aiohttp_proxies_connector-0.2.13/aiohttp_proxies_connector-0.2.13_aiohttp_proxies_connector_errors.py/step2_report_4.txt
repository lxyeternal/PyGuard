  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No data sources, sinks, or control flows are present.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n   - The code appears benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and contains no operational logic or potential vulnerabilities.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no operational or exploitable logic.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score 0.\n   - This is justified, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They reflect the benign nature of the code accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code only defines exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The uniformity and correctness of the reports support these scores.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling, with no security risks or malware present.",
