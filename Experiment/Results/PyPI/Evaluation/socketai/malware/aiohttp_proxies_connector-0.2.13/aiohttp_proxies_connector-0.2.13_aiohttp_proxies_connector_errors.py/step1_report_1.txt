  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input handling, or external output; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow, as this code only contains class definitions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly defines exception classes with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or embedded logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception types. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The structure is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, such as code execution, data leaks, or backdoors. The absence of any operational logic indicates this is likely a part of larger codebase where these exceptions are used for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, utility part of a larger application.",
