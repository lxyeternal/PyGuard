  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are defined; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy and connection errors. There are no data inputs, external communications, or suspicious logic. The structure follows standard Python exception inheritance patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are identified. The code appears to be a straightforward exception hierarchy setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple exception class hierarchy for SOCKS proxy errors. It does not contain any malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors. It is a benign component likely used in a larger network or proxy handling module.",
