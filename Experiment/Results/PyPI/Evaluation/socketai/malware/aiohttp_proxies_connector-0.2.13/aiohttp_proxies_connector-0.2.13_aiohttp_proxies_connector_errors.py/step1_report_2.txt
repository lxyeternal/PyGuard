  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output, or data processing occurring in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of standard exception class definitions without any unusual constructs or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes to handle various SOCKS and connection errors, following standard Python exception inheritance. There are no data inputs, no external data reads, no function calls, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. The classes are straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious code present. The purpose appears to be structured exception handling within a larger SOCKS proxy implementation, but this snippet alone does not contain any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a set of standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations or data handling that could be exploited or malicious. Therefore, it is safe and appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project.",
