  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging a project with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static data in setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "Reading file -> passing content to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README.md file with specified encoding, and calls setup() with package metadata. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with confidence=1. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or security risk elements. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
