  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package using setuptools, including reading a README.md for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Read from the file 'README.md' and pass it into the setup() function as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup process: importing setuptools, reading a Markdown README for the long description, and calling setup() with package info and dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or code execution beyond standard package setup. All operations are conventional and aligned with normal Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
