  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools, including reading a README.md file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file using open() to get the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code mainly performs static setup operations.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> Passing long_description to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python packaging practices: importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, reading a README.md file with specified encoding, and calling setup() with package metadata. All operations are static and conventional. No user input or external data influences the setup process, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
