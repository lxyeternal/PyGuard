  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including metadata and dependencies",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, package name, version, and dependency list",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'long_description' content if it contains malicious or unintended content",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file -> setting setup parameters -> package installation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README.md file for long description and defines package metadata such as name, version, and dependencies. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious data flows. No external or untrusted inputs are processed beyond reading a local README file, which is common practice. The dependencies list is empty, reducing risk of supply chain attack via dependencies. Overall, the code appears to be a benign and typical package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
