  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is being used in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "File read from the filesystem used directly in setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a README.md file for the long description. It then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, packages, and dependencies. The code is straightforward, standard for Python package setup, and does not contain any dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, standard, and free from malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
