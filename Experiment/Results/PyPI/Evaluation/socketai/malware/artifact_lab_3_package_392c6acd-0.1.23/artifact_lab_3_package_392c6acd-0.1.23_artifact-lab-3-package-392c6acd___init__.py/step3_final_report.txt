  "purpose": "Minimal import statement exposing a function named 'reverse_shell' from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __init__.py, importing 'reverse_shell' from '.main'.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential usage of 'reverse_shell' elsewhere could be a sink if invoked maliciously.",
  "flows": "Import of 'reverse_shell' into the namespace; no execution or data flow occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function named 'reverse_shell' which is associated with malicious remote access tools; no obfuscation or malicious code present here.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a straightforward import, with no execution or embedded malicious code. The function name 'reverse_shell' is suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity by itself. The scores in the reports appropriately reflect low malware potential and low security risk, considering the minimal context. The suspicion based solely on the name warrants caution, but without further usage details, the code remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign; the main concern is the function name 'reverse_shell', which could be misused elsewhere. Scores should remain low for malware (around 0.2) and security risk (around 0.2-0.3), with obfuscation at 0. The overall risk is minimal, but monitoring the usage of 'reverse_shell' in the broader codebase is recommended.",
