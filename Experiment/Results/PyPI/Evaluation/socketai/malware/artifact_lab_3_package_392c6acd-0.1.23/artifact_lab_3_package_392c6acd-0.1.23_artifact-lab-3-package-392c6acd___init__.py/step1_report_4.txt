{
  "purpose": "Import the reverse_shell function from the main module, likely to be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import reverse_shell",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "None observed in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code references a function named reverse_shell, which can be associated with malicious remote access tools if misused, but no malicious code is present here itself",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function named reverse_shell from a local module. There is no implementation of the function, nor any executable code or behavior. The presence of a function named reverse_shell raises suspicion due to its typical association with malicious remote access, but this code does not execute or define such behavior itself. No secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are observable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no malicious behavior in itself. However, the use of 'reverse_shell' as a function name warrants caution if the function implementation elsewhere is malicious. Based solely on this snippet, there is no direct malicious activity.",
