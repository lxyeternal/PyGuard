      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign; the main concern is the function name 'reverse_shell', which could be misused elsewhere. Scores should remain low for malware (around 0.2) and security risk (around 0.2-0.3), with obfuscation at 0. The overall risk is minimal, but monitoring the usage of 'reverse_shell' in the broader codebase is recommended."

It has high malware and security risk scores, with no obfuscation. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1."
