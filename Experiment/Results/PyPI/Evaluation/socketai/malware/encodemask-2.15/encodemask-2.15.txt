      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during setup, indicative of malicious intent. The high obfuscation, stealth, and potential for remote code execution justify high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity, but current evidence warrants treating the package as potentially malicious."
