  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly reflecting the absence of code and malicious behavior. The only adjustment needed is to set the risk score of Report 2 from 0.2 to 0, aligning with the lack of evidence. Overall, the dependency shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, and the scoring is appropriate."
