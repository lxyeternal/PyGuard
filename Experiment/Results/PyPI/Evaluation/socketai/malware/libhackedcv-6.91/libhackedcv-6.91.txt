      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious payload executed stealthily via an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup. The use of error suppression, hidden window execution, and suspicious URL comment further indicate malicious intent. The scores in the reports are appropriate, but the activity warrants a high malware and risk rating. The package should be flagged for further analysis and not used until decoded and verified."
