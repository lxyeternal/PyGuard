{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up a Python package named 'libhackedcv' with some package metadata. It also attempts to execute a PowerShell command if a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existence of the 'tahg' directory via os.path.exists and conditionally executes a subprocess to run a PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess runs a PowerShell command with encoded content, which may execute arbitrary code. The code also potentially writes files or runs malicious commands through this subprocess.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory -> If absent, executes encoded PowerShell command -> Possible execution of arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with a base64-encoded PowerShell command is suspicious. The encoded string might contain malicious instructions. The use of 'try-except' blocks without handling exceptions silently suppresses errors, which is unusual. The code comments and structure resemble obfuscated or malicious intent, especially given the reference to suspicious URL 'esquelesquad.rip' and the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "analysis": "Initially, the code attempts to import modules and conditionally executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is typical of malicious or obfuscated scripts. The PowerShell command is run with 'subprocess.Popen' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' to hide execution, indicating stealth intent. The setup function defines a package, but the main suspicious activity is the encoded PowerShell invocation. The code's overall behavior suggests an attempt to silently execute malicious code or backdoors during package installation. The remaining setup code appears standard and benign, but the initial malicious-looking subprocess execution outweighs this.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior due to the encoded PowerShell command executed without clear purpose. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with the reference to a suspicious URL and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent or backdoor capabilities. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be reviewed thoroughly before use.",
