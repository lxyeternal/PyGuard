{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package named 'libhackedcv', with some embedded potentially malicious behavior at the beginning.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (checking if 'tahg' exists), and executes a subprocess command via subprocess.Popen if the condition is met.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen command executes a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which could potentially lead to malicious actions or remote code execution.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the code executes the encoded PowerShell command, which could run arbitrary code or connect to malicious servers.",
  "anomalies": "The encoded PowerShell command indicates obfuscated activity. The presence of a hardcoded URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and the attempt to run an encoded command are suspicious. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which can hide failures of malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing 'setup' from distutils.core, then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. If a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, it runs an encoded PowerShell command, potentially malicious, without logging or error reporting. The setup function defines package metadata for 'libhackedcv'. The code overall suggests an attempt to perform malicious activities hidden behind a benign package installation routine. The obfuscated PowerShell command is a significant red flag, indicating possible remote code execution or data exfiltration. The try-except blocks suppress errors, making detection more difficult. The overall structure masks malicious intent within a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution that likely constitutes malicious activity, possibly to establish remote control or exfiltrate data during package installation. The setup configuration itself appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious code at the beginning.",
