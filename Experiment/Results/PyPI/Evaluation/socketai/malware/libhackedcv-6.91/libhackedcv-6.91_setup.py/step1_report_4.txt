{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package named 'libhackedcv' with the specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system (os.path.exists), reading environment variables (implicitly via subprocess), and importing modules (distutils.core, subprocess, os).",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that executes a PowerShell command with encoded content, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "If 'tahg' does not exist, the script executes an encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, which could be malicious. Otherwise, it proceeds to run setup.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a suspicious subprocess call executing an encoded PowerShell command that is hidden from casual inspection. The code tries to hide activity with try-except blocks and minimal error handling. The URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') appears suspicious or irrelevant. The command is encoded and may be malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing 'setup' from 'distutils.core' and then attempts to import 'subprocess' and 'os'. It checks for the existence of a file/directory named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64 (or similar encoding) using subprocess.Popen, which could execute arbitrary or malicious code. The command URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' is included as a comment, possibly indicating malicious intent or distraction. The setup() function is called with package metadata, which appears benign and standard for package publication. The use of try-except blocks around potentially dangerous code minimizes immediate errors but conceals any failures, indicating possible obfuscation. The encoded PowerShell command is the most suspicious part, as it could be designed to run malicious payloads silently. The rest of the code appears to be normal package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious embedded PowerShell command executed conditionally based on filesystem state. The encoded command, combined with the minimal error handling and hidden execution, suggests malicious intent, likely to perform malicious activity such as data exfiltration, persistence, or system compromise. The package setup appears benign but is used as a vehicle for malicious code execution.",
