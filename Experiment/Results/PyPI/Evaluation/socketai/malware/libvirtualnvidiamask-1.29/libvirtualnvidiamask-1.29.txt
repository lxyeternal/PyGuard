      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscated command execution, stealthy behavior, and suspicious URL comments. It should be considered malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the PowerShell payload. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be avoided."
