{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, but its exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the variable 'input_data' and possibly from environment variables if used, but no explicit source code for data input is provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or file writes if present, but these are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but without explicit source or sink references, the exact flow cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are observed. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation. There are no clear backdoors or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical data processing routines, such as string manipulation, data transformation, or calculations. No unusual behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or access to sensitive data, is apparent. The lack of external dependencies or network calls further reduces suspicion. Since no explicit input/output handling or secret data is visible, the code appears benign based on the snippet provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
