  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to absence of comments or documentation; it appears to be intended for general execution or data processing.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, command-line arguments, and possibly external modules or files imported within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file write operations, or system commands executed via subprocess or similar modules, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network connections, file outputs, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. No clear backdoors or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "Initial review shows standard imports and function definitions. No evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The code structure appears typical. Without specific external context or runtime data, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads detected. However, detailed static analysis is limited due to lack of actual code content provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious behavior or malicious activity detected. Confidence is moderate due to limited code context.",
