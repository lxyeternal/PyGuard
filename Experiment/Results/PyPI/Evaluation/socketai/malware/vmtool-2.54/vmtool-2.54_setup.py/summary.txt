  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the use of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, with error suppression. The pattern aligns with common malware tactics for covert execution. While definitive payload analysis is lacking, the behavior warrants caution and further investigation."
